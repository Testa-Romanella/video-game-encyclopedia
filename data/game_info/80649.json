{"id": 80649, "slug": "random-dungeon-generator-5epf", "name": "Random Dungeon Generator 5e/pf", "name_original": "Random Dungeon Generator 5e/pf", "description": "Endless RPG is a random dungeon and adventure generator for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder roleplaying games.<br/><br/>The Random Dungeon Generator is not a game. It is is a tool for playing pen-and-paper role-playing games alone, in a small group without a dungeon master, or with a dungeon master as either a standalone adventure or an easy way to get into the game.  <br/><br/>PLAY SOLO OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM<br/><br/>The Random Dungeon Generator allows you to explore a randomly-generated dungeon through a fog-of-war discovery system with encounters, traps, tricks and treasures shown as you encounter them.  This is perfect for solo play or those without a dungeon master.<br/><br/>DM TOOLS<br/><br/>While Endless RPG is aimed at players who want to play Pathfinder or DD solo or without a dungeon master, the app is also designed to make the life of a dungeon master easier.  <br/><br/>Custom Dungeons allow you to pick the CR level, environment (dungeon, cave, etc.) and enemy (orcs, undead, demons, etc.) and can generate a single level or multiple level dungeons. <br/><br/>The DM Mode reveals the map and allows you to peek into encounters, treasure, traps, etc. to better plan out the adventure.<br/><br/>You can even email the map to yourself complete with a legend so that you can use the randomly generated dungeon offline or import into third-party software.<br/><br/>MULTIPLE DUNGEON TYPES AND MULTI-LEVELS<br/><br/>The missions created by Endless RPG can encompass different types of 'dungeons' including caves, ruins, strongholds or the classic dungeon.  The missions can also be on a single level or multiple levels mixing and matching the dungeon types, so you can explore a cave that leads to ruins or a stronghold with a dungeon below it.<br/><br/>EXPORT TO VIRTUAL TABLETOPS (ROLL20, ETC) OR FOR OFFLINE USE<br/><br/>The DM Mode allows you to email the map of the dungeon level, which can help when trying to use the dungeon in Roll20 or other virtual tabletops or simply playing offline.  You can email a legend with the map that will show all encounters, treasures, etc.  You can also view the map full screen in order to take a screenshot.<br/><br/>QUICK BATTLE AND BATTLE MAPS FOR COMBAT<br/><br/>The app aids in keeping track of hit points with characters on the screen while exploring.  When encountering creatures, the player has a choice of simply clearing the encounter (the monsters will be considered defeated), utilizing a Quick Combat mode, which is perfect on smartphones or for quick battles with 1 or 2 creatures, or a full Battle Map, which allows a more tactical way of resolving combat.<br/><br/>SUPPORTS 8 CHARACTERS WITH D&amp;D 5TH EDITION AND PATHFINDER<br/><br/>The two most popular fantasy roleplaying systems are supported from levels 1-20.  Players can run through the dungeon as a single character or a party of up to eight characters.  A \"character\" can also include guard dogs, guard bears, or other non-standard creatures.  <br/><br/>EXPERIENCE AND LOOT TABLES<br/><br/>The app will keep track of the monsters you have killed, including the over experience points and experience points by character.  It will also track the treasure (magic items, coins, etc.) you have looted on your adventure.<br/><br/>HANDCRAFTED AND STITCHED TOGETHER<br/><br/>The app utilizes a method of stitching together pre-fabricated areas to give the look of a handcrafted area with the randomness of a generated dungeon.  Monsters, treasure and traps are also randomly placed to keep adventurers on their toes.<br/><br/>CREDITS:<br/><br/>Art by Raymond E.
