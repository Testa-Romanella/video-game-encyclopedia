The theme is \"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres\".</p>\n<p>The game is a sort of abstract twin-stick puzzle shooter thing. It features some original music that might be considered incompatible, though I have a hard time imagining that any genres could\u00a0really be\u00a0incompatible.<br/></p>\n<p>For best results, please play the standalone with a game controller. I've tested it with PS4 and Xbox360 controllers.</p>\n<p>I have not tested the Windows and Linux builds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0f7157c21d81ce8e76fce8670b9a5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["paulturowski"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
