I think the concept would work a lot better in a larger game with scarier graphics, but for this game jam I tried to adapt the idea into a bite sized experience as best as I could (and unfortunately, I'm the furthest thing from a visual artist).</p>\n<p>This is my first game period and the first time I've done most things in this game, so I spent basically the whole time learning everything you see, but I learned a hell of a lot! I tried to take on an ambitious amount for a beginner because hey, you need a reason to push yourself to learn new things.\u00a0I learned everything from how casting <em>actually</em> works, to how to use AI behavior trees.\u00a0I'm afraid some of my design choices might make some of the things I learned go unnoticed, but it be like that. I'll do better next time.</p>\n<p>I'm really glad I decided to participate, even if it didn't come out as well as I would have wanted. I didn't have a lot of time to have it play tested, and when it finally was, it was found to be a bit too easy. I've tried to bump the difficulty up, so hopefully people will lose at least once. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a3c4af88c8819493fe533a087aad8b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Straski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
