{"id": 979660, "slug": "yasai-game", "name": "yasai game", "name_original": "yasai game", "description": "\"Yasai Game\" is a falling object puzzle game that incorporates physics calculations. Players can evolve yasais by dropping different types of yasais into boxes and making them come into contact with each other. A total of 24 types of yasais appear, and the game can be cleared by making the cabbages and pumpkins touch each other.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA characteristic mechanic of the game is that combos occur when yasais evolve in a short period of time, and by making combos happen continuously, \"helper\" appear that are advantageous for gameplay. This helper character will stir up the Yasais in the box, giving you a chance to turn the game around once and for all.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Yasai Game\" has a time attack element where you aim to clear the game in a short time, a high score element where you aim to get the highest score, and a challenge element where you compete to see how far you can evolve your yasais. These can be competed on online leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T10:27:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/ceed86ef7daa096ebb2abd5d6d3e0ced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Picopicowvo"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Picopicowvo"], "esrb_rating": null}
