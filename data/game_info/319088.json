The only difference is that vampires sleep during the\r\nday and become active at night. And just like humans, vampires may experience trouble falling\r\nback asleep when they wake up in the middle of the day. It happens sometimes.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, unlike humans, vampires burn in the daylight, making falling back into slumber crucial\r\nfor you as a vampire. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve awoken during the afternoon, and you\u2019re out of\r\nsleeping potion (garlic-free, of course)! In this sidescrolling adventure, you must embark on the\r\ndangerous journey through the blinding outdoors to purchase another bottle of sleeping potion\r\nfrom your nearest witch located deep in the woods. Race to the witch\u2019s hut before you get\r\nburned alive in the scorching rays of sunlight. But not so fast, as you need to collect hearts to\r\nregain your health and raise your score. The way you see it, you need to get yourself some sleep,\r\nor die trying! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Left and right arrow keys: Move<br/>Up arrow key: Jump<br/>Enter key: Pause/restart<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created in Pico-8 by Francis Sapien and Lauren Smith for IMS 445.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c370c8807865a8c40dfa324584fa0c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lauren Smith"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
