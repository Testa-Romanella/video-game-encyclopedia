Use your mouse to pull away the little pathogens that appear around it and see how long you can last. Be careful, if you move too quickly they might jump out of your grab. There are also Stopwatch powerups that can temporarily slow down the pathogens and give you the upper hand!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f7d49901f69a60cdc5e76ba6f5a637.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gilel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
