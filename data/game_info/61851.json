Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.<strong>Notes for Tracker Users</strong><br/>If you are a user using Tracker, pay attention to this article.<br/><br/>The basic settings in Tennis Kings VR are two controllers, the left controller means a ball for a serve, and the right controller means a racket.<br/><br/>If you want to use the tracker that is attached to the racket, turn off one of the controllers and then connect the tracker. After that, the tracker automatically means right racket.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b2ce9e3c17187f946272c659b370735.jpg", "website": "http://www.appnori.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Appnori"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Appnori"], "esrb_rating": null}
