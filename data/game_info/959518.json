You have entered the RB Le Mans challenge. Your task is to complete and also survive all 24 laps. This may sound pretty much simple, but there are enemy cars charging towards you from the front. The opponents will not stop for anyone either!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controlling your car</strong></p>\n<p>At the start of the game (or after a loss of a life), your car will be still. In order to be able to move the car, you need to push it upwards. You cannot move your car left or right if it is still in idle mode. Just rev it up and feel the power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you let go of the joystick, the car will slow down automatically, but it will not stop. The car can be stopped by pulling down at the slowest speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>You score points by travelling distances. Also, if you complete a lap, you will be awarded a bonus of 1,000 points, plus an extra life.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Your fate</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Time:\u00a0</p>\n<p>You must complete each lap before the time runs out. If you complete a lap, the time will be reset to how it was at the start of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Running out of fuel:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your car runs low on fuel however, it is possible to completely refuel your car by picking up fuel barrels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Damaging your car:\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a status of a car with white lights, glass, etc. Every time you crash into an enemy car while no shield is active, the white areas of the car status panel will turn black. After all panels have turned black and a skull appears. You will lose a life. Crashing into enemy cars will also push your car around \u2013 sometimes you will be very unfortunate.</p>\n<p>Fortunately you can pick up a toolkit which will fully repair your car. You will also have a protective shield at the start of the game, you get hit by an enemy car or after losing a life.</p>\n<p>4. Lives:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lives are lost every time your car has been completely destroyed, or you crash into the scenery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you run out of time, fuel or all of your lives, the game is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Winning the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to win the game, you must complete all 24 laps of the race. Otherwise try to build up as many points as you possibly can before you lose the game. There is a hi score table, in which you can register your name.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Use a joystick in port 2\u00a0 (Numpad keys if playing via the web player)<br/></p>\n<p>Up\u00a0 / Numpad 8 \u2013 speed up (Letting go will automatically slow down your car)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Down\u00a0 / Numpad 2 \u2013 slow down and also brake\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left / Numpad 4 \u2013 move car left (when moving)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right / Numpad 6 \u2013 move car right (when moving)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Control / TAB \u2013 Pause game (Press fire / Z to resume)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Back arrow\u00a0 / \u00ac (while paused) - Abort race and return to the title screen\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming, charset and music by <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong><br/>Disk cover artwork, logo, loading bitmap and car sprites by <strong>Freeze/Blazon\u00a0<br/></strong>Game graphics and map design by <strong>Hugues (Ax!s) Poisseroux\u00a0<br/></strong>Tape turbo loader system by <strong>Martin Piper\u00a0<br/></strong>Disk Directory Art by <strong>Logiker/Vintage Computing Carinthia\u00a0<br/></strong>Testing by <strong>Richard, Baracuda, Hagiler, Freeze, Ax!s</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>You are welcome to share and copy this game onto your web sites, etc. Providing that everything is <strong><em>free</em></strong>.
