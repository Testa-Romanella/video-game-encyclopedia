It is here that I have made a game, a game for Sisyphus no less. Let's toss aside the boulder and make the wise fool carry stones, perhaps it would give him a sense of pride and accomplishment... but then perhaps not? What if he were to keep a score, yet unable to remember it. Such a punishment would surely fit the crimes of poor old king Sisyphus. Unfortunately his Boulder can hurt him no more, and how that pains Zeus so.</p>\n<p>(A and D to control and R to reset if you happen to get stuck)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/9370c31c31616bf4791f58aaaa885f39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justintime4u2bu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
