There is no game-play or objective yet and you can only walk around the simple generated dungeon.</p>\n<p>The game uses a tile-based generation algorithm to create overlapping dungeon layouts in a limit space.\u00a0For the algorithm to work properly you need at least 2.5m x 2.5m of free space (better are &gt;= 3.5m x 3.5m).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reconfiguration of the space is hidden by a lantern that has a limited illumination radius. This allows to explore a large area by walking only inside a fixed limited space.\u00a0 It can generate the illusion of actually walking a long distance in a fantasy dungeon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main inspiration for this comes from the 2013 paper Flexible Spaces:\u00a0https://www.ims.tuwien.ac.at/projects/flexible-spaces and also from the amazing work done by Void Room in Tea for God:\u00a0https://void-room.itch.io/tea-for-god.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>The dungeon walls were modeled and textured by Pixelfrankenstein</li><li>The cover image was sketched by\u00a0Aur\u00e9lien Leandri (https://www.deviantart.com/aurelienleandri)</li></ul>\n<p>As this is a very early\u00a0prototype it contains some placeholder artwork that will be replaced in future updates.
