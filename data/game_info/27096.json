Walk across the ingredient \n      to drop it closer to the waiting plate below. Once all the burgers have \n      been completed, you\u2019ll be able to move on to the next level. But watch \n      out: Renegade ingredients will stop at nothing to put an end to your \n      cooking days. Dodge them, stun them using pepper or drop a hamburger \n      ingredient on top of them to stop their chase. If you run out of pepper, \n      collect bonus foods such as coffee, chocolate and fries to recharge. \n      It\u2019s a nonstop food fight in this classic arcade game.\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
