Hopefully things will go well? <br/><br/>Navigate tense social dynamics in this<strong> (really short) </strong>narrative rhythm game by Atiya Nova. Keep the flow of conversation going by pressing keys at the right time to fill up the family's heart meter. Fill it up all the way before time runs out to progress to the next level. But at what cost...<h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li> Enjoy ~10 minutes of classical music and anxiety</li></ul><ul><li> Feast your eyes on some cute 3D visuals</li></ul><ul><li> Experience several rounds of moderately-paced rhythm action</li></ul><ul><li> Explore what it's like to be the firstborn daughter. It's not a miserable experience at all!</li></ul><ul><li> Look! Bunnies!</li></ul><h3>Developer Note</h3>Unfortunately I didn't have an XBox controller to test the game with, but it should work with PlayStation controllers if you enable it in the options menu. Additionally, please let me know if you run into any bugs or other such issues. It's just me, so I'm not sure how quickly I'll be able to address them, but I'll try my best! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-02T04:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1bc0a4d08ae2251696bdf78f8921c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atiya"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atiya"], "esrb_rating": null}
