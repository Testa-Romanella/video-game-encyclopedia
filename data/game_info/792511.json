It is made in 3D with Unity. Immediately on starting the game black boarders on the left and right will begin to converge to the center of the screen blocking some of the players view. The player must accurately hit active targets to push the boarders back out from the center. If the boarders reach the center the game is over.\u00a0Hitting a headshot will increase the distance the boarders will travel by 1.5x. As the game progresses the boarders will begin to move faster into the center of the screen but successful shots will also move the boarders a greater distance from the center of the screen.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T13:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e961d303a27399628bd42cddcdaf1f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric268"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
