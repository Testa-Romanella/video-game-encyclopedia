The rules are pretty simple, you need to regroup all the cards of each symbol in the 4 top stacks, in order starting from the ace. To do so, you can move all the face up cards as you want, and each card can only go with another card of a different color and the value just above its one. There's also a side deck you'll need to use to go further !</p><p>You can right click to move a card automatically !</p>\n\n<p>Made with Unity during my free time, the game was a way for me to relax a bit, while practicing my programming skills, by making a clean\u00a0code architecture, and try out some new things I never did before in Unity.</p>\n<p>Also I hope you'll enjoy the art! ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b8923ec62b7a16ca40a69e55b31d9ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Robin Six - Saering"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
