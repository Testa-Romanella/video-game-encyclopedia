What if we were to combine those two together? You would get Clash of the Pockets, where you send different types of ball troops around to knock opposing balls into pockets. This game involves the preparation of alining shots and seeing where the opponents are and the satisfaction of knocking as many enemies as you can whilst keeping your troops safe from elimination. Combine this with different archetypes of balls and playing cards you can draw out to alter the battlefield, and you have a game that can put both the players and viewers on the edge of their seat through patient strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A physics system to knock balls around and allow speed and weight have an effect on the interactions between balls and walls (Speed increases knockback whilst weight decreases momentum during collisions)\r\n</li><li>Launch balls by selecting and dragging them like a slingshot.\r\n</li><li>A card system that grants players a temporary ability before they can push a ball\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Strength I II III:</em></strong> Grants the player additional power to knock balls at high speeds\u00a0(Level determines amount of power increased)</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Weight Gain I II III:</em></strong> Allows the player to increase the weight of one ball (Level determines amount of weight gained)</p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Famine I II III:</em></strong> Allows the player to decrease the weight of one enemy ball (Level determines amount of weight lost)</p>\n<ul><li>A score history recording the number of turns passed, the balls remaining per match, and the number of cards used\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><em><em><strong>Concept Artis</strong><strong>t:\u00a0</strong></em></em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>William Min, Jaynie Leavins\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Programmer:\u00a0</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cesar Romero, William Min</p>\n<p><strong><em>Level Designer:</em></strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Cesar Romero\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>UI Designer:</em></strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Jaynie Leavins\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>UX Designer:</em></strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>William Min,\u00a0Jaynie Leavins</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pieces Designer:</em></strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>William Min, Jaynie Leavins, Cesar Romero \r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sounds:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Free Casual Game SFX Pack, by Dustyroom</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfd/cfdd9bac27899ac218bdf7a0cd335453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["wkmin1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
