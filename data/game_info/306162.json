{"id": 306162, "slug": "shelter-3", "name": "Shelter 3", "name_original": "Shelter 3", "description": "<p>Playing as a part of a herd, you&#39;ll enjoy the company of other elephants, large and small. Walk peacefully side-by-side with the elders, swim with the young, or delight in mischievous moments of baby elephants at play. Elephants thrive in a collective and so will you. Being in a herd means that you\u2019ll be better protected against predators. You\u2019ll also learn the wayfinding wisdom of the elders. But travelling together means there are many mouths to feed, and you must share resources and be constantly on the move to stay healthy.<br />\nYour journey will be scattered with magical moments as you discover new terrain and untrodden pathways, and should you choose to wander after nightfall, you might just come across one of the fabled Ancestral Gathering Grounds.<br />\nA Different Kind of Animal<br />\nShelter 2 centred on a lone lynx mother and her cubs as they found and killed prey, now Shelter 3 asks you to explore a different kind of animal existence, one where motherhood, social harmony and inheritance are the keys to prosperity.<br />\nLike its forebears, Shelter 3 invites you to detach yourself from human matters and inhabit the spirit of an animal. Landscapes and fauna are rendered in mesmerising patterns and scored with an enchanting soundtrack by Retro Family, conjuring a magical world to lose yourself in.<br />\nFrom lynx cubs to elephant families, from the tundra to the jungle, from survival to cooperation, the next Shelter incarnation migrates to new territory, evolving into a bigger game world and an experience that you won\u2019t forget.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af4c228fbcab2f859a5f4df15fbc8cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 26, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Might and Delight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Might and Delight"], "esrb_rating": null}
