{"id": 55536, "slug": "maelstrom", "name": "Maelstrom", "name_original": "Maelstrom", "description": "<p>Maelstrom is a 2D video game developed by Andrew Welch, released in November 1992 for Macintosh. The game is an enhanced clone of Atari's 1979 Asteroids arcade game with a visual style similar to Atari's 1987 sequel, Blasteroids. Maelstrom was released when there were few action games for the high-resolution color displays of the Macintosh, so it garnered interest (despite the dated concept) and led to the creation of Ambrosia Software. The game was later released under GPL and Creative Commons license as Free and open-source software. Ports for operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS and Windows, resulted from this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d13c7728170ffe94271106e8c19b37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Ambrosia Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Ambrosia Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
