We figured we would give it a more \"realistic\" feel by really portraying what a horseman with no head might feel like. Like in the story the objective is to collect your head before sunup or you will be doomed to try again the next night! </p><p>Have fun let us know what you think. We will have the complete source project available on our website! http://solarbyte.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68afb2db839c382b429b71a2d5e1bbef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SolarByte"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
