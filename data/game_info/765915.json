Now, I\u2019ve got people coming up to me all the time, asking me the big questions like \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with you\u201d and \u201cwho are you, again?\u201d And, well, you deserve to know the truth!</p>\n<p>We\u2019re gonna get into it all. Questions of life, love, gender, sexuality, identity, philosophy, religion. Gonna lay it all bare, motherfuckers. We\u2019re gonna answer questions you didn\u2019t even think to ask, and then we\u2019re gonna answer the followups to those.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been holding my cards close to my chest for a while, but honestly writing this all out has been a pretty massive relief. Well, without further ado, let\u2019s get into it! Hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T12:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a5427e53545db97e9124a456e4bb781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rathayibacter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
