Within a simulated patient encounter, you will experience the short-term and long-term impact of your clinical choices.\r\nThis case is centered around a medical student, Jessica Davis, who presents to an urgent care clinic with severe pain. In this clinical simulation, you will make choices as Ms. Davis's primary care provider and experience outcomes based on the choices you make. You will be challenged to:<br/><br/>\r\n~ Evaluate patient's need for opioid therapy to manage acute pain<br/>~ Assess the safety of prescribing opioids for acute pain in the context of urgent care with an unknown patient<br/>~ Follow current guidelines when prescribing opioids for acute pain in terms of dosage and amount prescribed<br/>~ Provide targeted patient education regarding opioids for patients in the context of being treated for acute pain in urgent care<br/><br/>You will complete typical steps of a patient encounter and receive feedback after each step:<br/><br/>~ Review medical record<br/>~ Complete an evaluation and treatment plan<br/>~ Make a plan of care for your patient<br/><br/>Feedback is color-coded to let you know whether you made the best selection, a less than ideal selection, or an incorrect selection. With the ability to retry a section or continue down paths to see impacts of different decisions, you will learn by doing without causing real-world negative outcomes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Who We Are:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The <em>CE: PainTx\u00a0</em>suite of cases were developed by Clinical Tools, Inc. through a NIDA grant (\u00a0#1R44DA035042\u00a0).
