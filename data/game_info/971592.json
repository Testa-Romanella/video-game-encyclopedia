The built-in game engine allows users to play games, series, tournaments, and entire seasons using players from any baseball season from 1927-2021.  The board game companion feature allows users to bypass the game engine and manually play games using their favorite tabletop baseball game.  Tabletop results can quickly be entered and integrated with the stats generated by the built-in game engine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe included seasons contain as-played lineups, real-life schedules and transactions, left/right splits (1954-2021), custom player ratings (1954-2021), and ballparks (with park factors and over 40 ballpark images).  In addition, you can utilize the easy to use player library tools to customize your libraries by adding player pictures, logos, sounds, and custom play-by-play calls.  You can also quickly and easily build your own custom seasons from scratch using team/players from any year in history.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWant to learn more?
