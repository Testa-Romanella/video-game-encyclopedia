She knows they're ready to surprise her for her birthday. She knows she just wants to go home and snuggle her cat and not deal with those weirdos. Can she get to the door without getting caught? Or will she be \"surprised\" at the totally stealthy birthday party being thrown in her honor?</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Currently, this game is 3 player hot-seat only. Didn't have time to write AI. Each player is either the Boss or an Employee. Maybe not the best design during a pandemic. Be safe!<br/></p>\n<p>The Boss must reach the door at the end of the map without coming in range of the Employees. The Employees must come within range of the Boss without being in Line-of-Sight of the Boss. If they're caught, they're disqualified. (Unimplemented) You can't surprise someone when the person knows you're there!<br/></p>\n<p>When it's your turn, point, click, and it will queue your move. Each player is given random initiative each round, just to add a bit of unexpectedness.<br/></p>\n<p>Hint: Use footsteps to try to locate your prey, or to stay away from your well-meaning Employees. . Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>\n<p>This prototype was made for the Yogscast 2020 Game Jam. The theme was \"Surprise.\" We kinda landed on something on-the-nose. Oh well! This game was made in Unity 2020<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67ed5dde40e609218e76fdba453a1ae4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter & Sparrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
