{"id": 603693, "slug": "everglory-itch", "name": "EVERGLORY (itch)", "name_original": "EVERGLORY (itch)", "description": "<p>Stockpile resources, build your settlement, raise an army, and wage war in this modern take on the classic RTS formula.<br/></p>\n\n<p>In EVERGLORY resources are stored at local storage sites and must be consolidated at a location in order to be used. Plan your base wisely and set up transport routes as you craft the living machinery powering your economy. Optimizing supply chains is key.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Combine existing units and resources in a plethora of ways to form an increasingly more powerful army. Every great warrior starts out as a humble peasant.</p>\n\n<p>Guide up to 1000 individually-controlled units through the battlefield. Explore enormous maps stretching across 1024x1024 tiles.</p>\n\n<p>Embark on a legendary journey that takes place on meticulously-crafted maps full of diverse quests, mysterious secrets, custom mechanics, and scripted interactions.</p>\n\n<p>Explore a mystic world inspired by the history of medieval Russia. Fight off hordes of Mongolian Orcs and foil the sinister plans of the magic-wielding Teutonic Knights.</p>\n\n<p>EVERGLRORY is powered by the fully open-source Permafrost Engine. Re-balance units, tweak missions, or change the fundamental rules of the game all by editing a couple of lines of Python. All the tools used for creating the campaign are included with the release.</p>\n\n<p>All the core mechanics are functioning and working without known issues. I\u2019ve really prioritized a stable engine and a rock-solid foundation over rushing out more content. I\u2019ve held off on releasing anything at all until I had a stable build that\u2019s been scrutinized with a lot of testing. You can explore, build, gather, and battle without any major hiccups. Essential but often forgotten features like game saving and graphics options are all there.<br/></p>\n<p>In terms of content, there is one playable faction (Slavs) with 10+ unique units and 8+ unique buildings. There is a tutorial and a lengthy demo mission that's a fairly complete vertical slice of the game. After completion, the rich scripting API and map editor should keep you busy crafting your own scenarios.</p>\n<p>I intend to keep evolving the game, mainly focusing on production of more content. Be on the lookout for the\u00a0Early Access build dropping on\u00a0Steam. As well, I\u2019ve already open-sourced the entire engine (GitHub). Between the engine and the Python scripts that you get with the release, you have access to 100% of the code. The Blender files for all the models are also provided. This grants the community all the tools to continue evolving it long after I\u2019m gone.</p>\n<p>You can keep tabs on development progress on\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Discord or get in touch by shooting me an\u00a0e-mail. Lastly, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T10:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4ccd2882809b03678de86740bb9be268.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["spb"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
