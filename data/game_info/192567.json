You will use the bird as a weapon in order to make bird reach to the cage. You can collect some gold on the way. There is 2 different maps for playing. <br/><br/>(There was problem with WebGL compiling i will add that build when possible) <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>WASD to walk. <br/>Mouse for aiming. <br/>Left Click Send/Call bird. <br/><br/>Notes about mechanics: <br/>If bird hits an enemy it will start pecking(switching through some shitty sprites) and damaging enemy. <br/>You can't call the bird back if bird cant see you. (a.k.a. Raycast hits something which is not you). <br/>If you call bird back before she kills an enemy that enemy will be stunned for a short time.</p><p>Ludum Dare Entry Page: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&amp;uid=49861 (Downloadable versionsa are there!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a053ec1774c102844559f780be3bc8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mantlair"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
