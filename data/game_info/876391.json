{"id": 876391, "slug": "inverse-construction", "name": "Inverse Construction", "name_original": "Inverse Construction", "description": "<p>A destruction contractor is surprised when the supposedly abandoned destruction site appears infested with demons. He must use his brute strength to rid the place of demons before he can start construction!</p><p>This game was made entirely within the span of 48 hours as part of a halloween game jam. The theme of the jam was \"abandoned places\". Gamemaker Studio 2 was used and all assets except for sound effects were made by a lone developer.</p>\n<p>Instruction:</p>\n<p>Inverse Construction is meant to be played with a controller, but currently mainly supports Xbox controllers. Controls are listed below</p>\n<p>Controller (Xbox 360 terms):<br/>DPad/Left stick - move<br/>X - attack<br/>B - grab</p>\n<p>Keyboard and mouse:<br/>WASD or Arrows - move<br/>H, Z, or LMB - attack<br/>K, C, or RMB - grab</p>\n<p>The grab command can also be used to throw an enemy. If you throw an enemy into a wall, they become vulnerable and take additional damage when you hit them. Notice that, in the current version of the game, throwing an enemy into a wall deals damage to the wall but not the enemy.<br/>By attacking or throwing enemies, you can destroy walls. When a wall is destroyed, there is a chance you will recieve health.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T19:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/424e2522c42e3b858bf072d9d28d4bc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmoGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
