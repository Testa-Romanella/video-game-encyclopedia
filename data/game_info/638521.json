You may simulate running\u00a0through stationary running, a treadmill or a step machine. Make sure you hold on to something if you use a treadmill or a step machine! You don\u2019t need the controllers so you can also hold some weights or wear fitness sand bags or elastic bands for better fitness performance!</p>\n<p>You are a professional champion runner somewhere in the future and you have been hired by the military to help with some missions. In this game you are infiltrating an enemy base, you just took a device with important information and you need to run back to your spaceship. You need to collect as much energy as possible to bring to the ship. If you hit certain objects, they break down into energy because of your invisible shield. These objects are the crystals, the green and the blue energy balls, however, some objects would have negative effects upon your speed so you need to avoid them, like the red energy balls.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You have a minimum speed, a maximum speed and a running power which defines how fast you are accelerating when you run continuously. Therefore, your speed is increasing from the minimum speed to the maximum speed with the running power\u2019s rate but it decreases if you stop running.</p>\n<p>The final score at the end of the level will depend on how many points you collected and the time it took you to finish it, which needs to be as little as possible and less than the maximum time to finish the level.</p>\n<p>This is just a demo that has 3 difficulty levels and a training scene, but we will be launching the full game soon!</p>\n<p>Make sure you are in a safe environment, that somebody is looking after you and that you cannot injure yourself in any way!\r\n  </p>\n<p>The way you are using this game is done so at your own risk!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T07:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c24798611d110ca66b40389682493f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ULTRA FUN GAMES"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
