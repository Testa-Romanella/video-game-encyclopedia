Although something felt off, she was quickly brought back into it by her overwhelming daily routines.<br/><br/>A mundane high school life, classmates and teachers going about as they would, the bustling square of the school festival... all went on in an orderly fashion just as the girl expected.<br/><br/>But under the calm surface, something more mysterious is slowly unfolding in a place out of the public eye...<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a fan-made RPG developed by Bilibili's virtual streamer, HiiroVTuber's secondary content creation team \"Yume Sakura High School Development Department\". The game is entirely free and we hope that Wang Milks can help our development team with more publicity.<br/><br/>The story tells a mind-boggling suspense-filled adventure story on campus. The game is played via two main elements: text interaction and scene decryption.
