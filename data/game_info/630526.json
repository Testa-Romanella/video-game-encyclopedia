Blast your friends away with the different characters in this frenetic golf game.</p>\n<p>There are updates almost every day so keep tuned, or join the official discord and get some friends to play with.</p>\n<p>I don't have enough friends to playtest, so I could only test up to 2v2 and it works fine. I can't say anything for games bigger than that, but it should be supported up to 5v5. Hopefully.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>If you've never played a golf game before, it is highly encouraged to play the tutorial, it is only 5 minutes long at most, probably even less.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nWhat's next in development?\r\n<p>Well, for now, I plan on releasing 3 new characters on Sunday 27th at around 5am PST(this has already been released). <br/>After that, there are 2 things I would like to focus on: a new map and a new game mode. I already have most of that planned, I would just need to execute it, which would probably take around a whole week (and then more time for polishing).<br/>Now I am working in the aforementioned map., which should be out on the 4th of July.<br/>I also am very open to suggestions, be it for new character ideas, maps or game modes, or anything you think might make the game better, so make sure to join the discord and tell me what you think.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T17:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e12e9b30069c8d8fcdcec5607e5c1e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KilThrall"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
