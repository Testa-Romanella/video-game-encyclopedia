Keep it below 1000 (or the custom limit set in the menu) to stop them from destroying themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>How was it made?:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I'll be making a youtube video soon, but the software I used:</p>\n<p><em>Photoshop - Art<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Godot - Game Making<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Bosca Ceoil - Music (It's bus-ka-k-yo-ill btw)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>OBS Studio -Recording (youtube)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Audacity - Voice (youtube)<br/></em></p>\n<p>All of these are free, except for photoshop, but there are many alternatives out there, like GIMP.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>The default IQ to lose is unrealistic.
