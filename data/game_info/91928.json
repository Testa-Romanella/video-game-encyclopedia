The version of Anchored that is found here on itch.io is considered a vertical slice (demo or proof of concept), and was originally designed to be displayed at a game conference. The game was uploaded in the state it was after the course ended. Since the team is now scattered around different schools with new projects, we are not able to continue development.<br/></p><p>We are humbled by the amount of interest and positive feedback Anchored has gotten since we uploaded it and this makes us wish we were able to continue development. It is not impossible, however, that circumstances will allow us to finish Anchored in the future.<br/></p><p>Either way, your feedback is always of interest to us, so don't hesitate to leave a comment telling us what you think of the game.
