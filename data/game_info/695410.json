It has 10 awesome levels and 7 interesting powerups.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You control the paddle at the bottom of the screen. You need to destroy the bricks by hitting them with a ball. If the ball leaves the bottom of the screen you lose a life. You need to move the paddle left and right to keep the ball on the screen.</p>\n<p>The angle the ball bounces when hitting the paddle is controlled by where it hits the paddle. The different powerups appear when you break a brick with a blue orb.</p>\r\nPowerups\r\n<p><strong>Red</strong> = Megaball - Lets the ball smash through bricks without changing direction<br/>\n<strong>Orange</strong> = Slowdown - Slows down the ball speed<br/>\n<strong>Yellow</strong> = Multiball - Splits the nearest ball into two balls. You only lose a life if you lose your last ball<br/>\n<strong>Green</strong> = Sticky - Makes the paddle sticky so the ball will stick to it<br/>\n<strong>Blue</strong> = Expand - Expands the size of the paddle<br/>\n<strong>Purple</strong> = Shrink - Shrinks the paddle but also gives you a 11x score multiplier<br/>\n<strong>Pink</strong> = Extra life - Gives you an additional life</p>\r\nScoring\r\n<p>Hitting multiple bricks in a row increases your score multiplier to a maximum of 10x. Hitting the ball with the paddle resets the multiplier back to 1x.</p>\n<p>Losing all lives resets your score to 0, but you can continue playing. For the highest score possible, try finishing the game without losing your lives.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my first game! I'd love to hear your thoughts and highscores \ud83d\ude0a</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac79c9f36b7c27a8e06946908f222c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurboYeti"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
