{"id": 803070, "slug": "soulslike-accessibility-demo", "name": "Soulslike Accessibility Demo", "name_original": "Soulslike Accessibility Demo", "description": "<p>This is the application for my 4th-year honours project at Abertay University\u00a0testing accessibility in relation to difficulty in soulslike and metroidvania titles. The game can be played independently without the accessibility features but can also be used with them. The audio compass was used in an experiment with the audio muted. The high-visibility mode uses a screen overlay to simulate macular degeneration, which is still in the game. The game was also played with an Xbox\u00a0Adaptive Controller to simulate motor disabilities.</p>\n<p>You can download a pdf version of the dissertation to read with the project. The experiment involved is in no way representative of a larger group and more studies are needed in this area.<br/></p>\n<p>THIS GAME DOES NOT RECORD YOUR GAMEPLAY DATA. The build used in the experiment recorded gameplay analytics to use in the discussion about accessibility and difficulty. The build provided here has had these features removed.</p>\n<p>This game supports gamepads however the menus do not function correctly with them so please use the mouse and keyboard to navigate menus.</p>\n<p>Art Credits:</p>\n<p>Caves of Gallet by Adam Saltsman:<br/>https://adamatomic.itch.io/cavernas</p>\n<p>Bringer of Death by Clembod:<br/>https://clembod.itch.io/bringer-of-death-free</p>\n<p>Archer Hero and Rogue Knight by Dark Pixel/Kronovi:<br/>https://darkpixel-kronovi.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Evil Wizard by Luiz Melo:<br/>https://luizmelo.itch.io/evil-wizard</p>\n<p>Menu Buttons by Nectanebo:<br/>https://nectanebo.itch.io/menu-buttons</p>\n<p>Health &amp; Mana Bar Assets (Diamond) by Sweenus:<br/>https://sweenus.itch.io/health-mana-bar-assets-diamond</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T13:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd66b868164fbbbdeb95f3fdcfe71d2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PapaDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
