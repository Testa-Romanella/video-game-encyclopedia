Unfortunately there's not much else<br/>going on in the demo day build because this is all so fresh. There are several<br/>aerial targets to destroy, and a handful of ground targets. You can press R to<br/>restart the scenario.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The entire game was designed around an Xbox One controller. If you have it, it's highly recommended you use it. I\u00a0can't guarantee how well it works with other gamepads. Backup keyboard controls have been added, but this wasn't designed with keyboard in mind.</p>\r\nXbone Controller (Recommended)\r\n<p>Gun: A<br/>Missiles: B<br/>Target: Y<br/>Switch: X<br/>Pitch: Left Thumbstick Up/Down<br/>Roll: Left Thumbstick Left/Right<br/>Yaw: Left/Right Triggers<br/>Speed up: Left Bumper<br/>Slow down: Right Bumper<br/>Look around: Right Thumbstick</p>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p>Gun: L.Ctrl<br/>Missiles: Space<br/>Target: Q<br/>Switch: C<br/>Pitch: Up/Down Arrow<br/>Roll: Left/Right Arrow<br/>Yaw: A/D<br/>Speed up: W<br/>Slow down: S<br/>Restart: R</p>\r\nUsing missiles\r\n<p>Lock onto a target with Y (Xbone gamepad) or Q (keyboard) and fly towards the target. You can hold down the target key to lock the camera to the target to help you find them. Once the target box turns red, they are locked and a missile will\u00a0track the target if it's launched.</p>\n<p>Press the Switch button to switch to the second set of missiles. These are bigger<br/>and have a longer range, but take a little longer to lock and aren't as maneuverable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d3d33227cfc076a8b487268ad20437.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Why485"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
