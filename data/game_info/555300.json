Mindscape was made in under 4 days for the Eureptus Game Jam #1. The theme was: One level but it is consistently changing. In this game, you play a comatose patient trying to wake up. But, every time you get to the door to leave this mind prison it moves. Will you ever escape?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: [A] [S] | Arrow Keys | Controller</p>\n<p>Jump: XBox A | Up | [W]</p>\n<p>Fullscreen: [F] | [Select]</p>\n<p>Exit: [ESC]</p>\n\n<p>Known bugs: When the platforms are ascending, the player collision box will become stuck with the platforms'. Moving side to side while repeatedly pressing jump sometimes solves this issue. Alternatively, you could just wait for the platforms to descend.</p>\n\n<p>The plan was to add dialogue in between each door transition, however, due to time restraints and my limited knowledge, this was not possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a630f112a7009b2c661611afb73354b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JoerassicPark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
