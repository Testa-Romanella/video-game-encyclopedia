To do so, she attempts to explore the legendary \u201cSeven Wonders of the Academy.\u201d However, each wonder she seeks out only results in failure. Finally, she tries the only thing that\u2019s left, the Seventh Wonder: \u201cGet kicked by a horse and die,\u201d which turns out to be more than outrageous\u2013<br/><br/>She accidentally digs her own grave out of curiosity, and finds something strange.<br/><br/>These are the strange, fun, and\u2014 precious seven days of Ayako and her friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>With only seven days left for her investigation of the Seventh Wonder, Ayako happens upon her friend Anna and another girl, Komaki, making love in Anna\u2019s room. Ayako seemingly had no intention to peep but in the process of doing so she comes across the ghost. Ayako screams in surprise and is subdued by Anna who discovers her peeping. Unable to explain herself, Komaki is convinced that Ayako is some sort of pervert and Anna dismisses the idea that a ghost appeared only because they were having sex. <br/><br/>Dejected, Ayako returns to her room where Miyabi, the ghost, appears before her again. She finds out that Miyabi in fact is a fan of peeping on girls making love. With no way of writing a report on a ghost that is not only, not haunted by the past or a grudge, and instead simply has a unique past time, Ayako tries to find a way to convince Anna and Komaki that the ghost is real. <br/><br/>The plan is basically to convince Anna and Komaki to get it on in order to lure the ghost out. What Ayako doesn\u2019t realize is that seeing Anna making love to another girl is also causing her to question her own emotions and desires as well. These are the odd, fun, and precious seven days of Ayako and her friends. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Full Japanese voice acting, including the main character<br/></li><li>Uncensored H-scenes<br/></li><li>Music composed by wata of game developer LizArts<br/></li><li>Captivating single route storytelling with two endings<br/></li><li>Beautiful artwork by 400</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b5c5b0c09016ebe718ec80d02bf920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 16, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 14, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lilies Project"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Denpasoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
