She gets out of the basement and goes above ground, where she sees the doctor in the distance. It seems that the doctor abandoned the girl. Help the girl escape the hospital by dodging the doctor!<br/><br/><br/><br/>13iew is a spooky horror puzzle game. Play by switching between first person and side view, and solve puzzles by interacting with various objects according to the viewpoint. Our game is not a horror game. It's a spooky game.<br/><br/>You'll have to use your brain a bit because you have to play with differentiating between objects you can interact with in first person and objects you can interact with in third person.<br/><br/>Controls are similar to other side-view games, but with the addition of first person, it can be a little complicated, but you will soon get used to it. Explore in 1st person a space that can't be seen in 3rd person, search for clues and solve puzzles. You can feel the atmosphere of a third-person game and the atmosphere of a first-person game at the same time.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There are 3 chapters, and feel the atmosphere of each chapter and find the foreshadowing all over the map.<br/><br/>You can enjoy it by understanding why the doctor abandoned the girl in the basement as you complete the story through hidden foreshadowings and various devices throughout the map.<br/><br/>ps. Made by a team of college students, there may be many missing parts.
