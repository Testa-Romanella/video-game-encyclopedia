The Mac and Linux versions of the game have not been tested.</p><p>This is a little physics game that I made where you have to jump around to avoid these red capsules that shoot balls for 90 seconds while smashing into block pillars and walls. There is a fun but challenging minigame that you can do if you wanted a challenge and/or a time killer, where you must texture 50% of all the grey blocks with the texture of the game icon. Using an Xbox controller is highly recommended when playing this game, however you can use the keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/522/522b34fda0e1699a98b9816b15dc6a0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SaintLA"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
