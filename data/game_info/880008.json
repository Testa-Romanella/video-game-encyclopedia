Your Username is always visible at the top left of the Home screen or during the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe Controls are the same as the standards that all games have, 'W' key to go forward, 'S' key to go backward, 'A' key to go left and 'D' key to go right. By pressing the 'Esc' key you can operate the game menu where you can change the volume and other small customizations. To shoot, just point the mouse in the direction of where you want the bullet to go and hold the left button.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nMaps are randomly generated and 104 combinations are possible, the size is always the same and corresponds to a square of 31x31 blocks (block \u2243 150px). The spawnpoint (position of the player at the beginning of the game) is random. The number of zombies on the map is always fixed at 8.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe Leaderboard is a table where it shows the ranking and score of all players. The first column shows the position in the standings, the second the username of the player and the third the score with the number of victories next to it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe Score is the shortest time (in seconds) taken to kill all the zombies on the map.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17d429ee892e8661a55251d3dd04a3f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MainKronos"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
