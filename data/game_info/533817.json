Decay is typically considered morbid or disgusting, but decomposition is the natural process of recycling energy back to the earth. Without death, life would come to a halt. This game simulates an ecosystem and puts you, an energy fairy, in control of maintaining balance. If the forest's population grows too much, many will starve; but without the sacrifice of some, grass will cease to grow.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created during a game jam\u00a0with my own personal engine that was developed over the course of one semester; if you find any bugs, please let me know so I can fix them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/4511ca20d086aff8e488f4e286125920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnimoonMedia"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
