The main things I have focused on is creating the main character and the lighting system( wich is really cool, if I were to say so myself), and during the last two weeks I have planned out the whole worldmap for the game.</p>\n<p>I will update the game biweekly until it is ready to be released, which will be sometime during June. Until then you can give feedback here or go to the discord, where I post some more about the game!</p>\n<p>NOW REMEMBER: WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS NOT NEAR THE FINAL VERSION OF THE GAME, IT IS A VERY EARLY PROTOTYPE AND A LOT OF THINGS WILL BE ADDED AND CHANGED UNTIL THE GAME GETS RELEASED.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/jX7mHCC (Just jump in!)<br/></p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/hizuvia\u00a0(Nothing there yet)</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEsA7b1O6vX7cVrxF1nQotg\u00a0(I post my entries to one hour compo here and a bit of original music)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T04:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2d/f2d4b92a098d8edaafe3aa93b2a51fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HIZUVI"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
