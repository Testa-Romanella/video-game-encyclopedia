On the first day I suggested the \"sacrifice your crew to power the sonar\" mechanic to my kid as a way of rate-limiting its use (everything else was a UI nightmare), but it was just a mechanics discussion, not a way of creating a mood.</p>\n<p>As the game progressed, I\u00a0wound up\u00a0choosing music that really pushed me down this alley. Once I had Bensound's \"Ofelia's Dream\" in there, the idea came to me that we'd track the crew with figures to help humanize them.\u00a0And then, that we'd show them as people on the end-game screen. By this point I\u00a0was aware that I really wanted to make it a hard decision to sacrifice your crew.</p>\n<p>I added the sword slashing sound to the sacrifice mechanic along with human screams. I'm a tiny bit concerned with how much time I\u00a0spent getting those screams just right.</p>\n<p>I love how you see your dead crew members' names on the end screen. My only regret is I didn't have time to add their\u00a0partner status and number of children.</p>\n<p>Other Design Discussion</p>\n<p>The instructions screen was initially a wall of text. I like how you can now pilot the submarine around and try out the sonar. This works to as both a bit of a fun mini-tutorial (I love shooting unlimited torpedoes) and also to ensure your microphone volume is correct.</p>\n<p>You might notice the use of caps across\u00a0the instructions. I took my cue from my favorite old-school game:\u00a0Space Taxi (for the Commodore-64). Its instruction screen was much like this, with caps for emphasis in an age with no bolding or italics.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Microphone volume extension by HappyTearParakoopa.</li><li>The now heavily-modified submarine profile came from 'Rama', Cc-by-sa-2.0-fr</li><li>'Ofelia's Dream' from Bensound.</li><li>Sound effects from GDC giveaway via Sonniss.</li><li>Plant life from Open Pixel Project Jungle Theme.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T05:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e23/e230cef2fa601b850bdcf4e7516410a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mike LeSauvage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
