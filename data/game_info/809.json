It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to Skate 2.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game takes place sometime later after the events of Skate 2. The main protagonist, who is now known as The Legend, became one of the best skaters. He travels to a coastal town of Port Carventer to take part in a sponsored event but fails. To get to the top again, he has to put up his own team.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Port Carventer differs a lot from San Vanselona. There are no zones where skating is restricted. The city itself consists of three zones: The City, The University, and the Industrial Area. Each zone has its own differences, for example, there are a lot of monuments and concrete buildings in The City, while The University boasts a high number of open spaces.</p>\n<p>Like in previous installments, the game&#39;s core mechanic called Flick It is still present in the game and is essential for getting high scores. It gives the player control of the skater and maps it to the right stick of the gamepad. Players are given points for doing tricks. The amount of points depends on the difficulty of the trick and their combos. </p>\n<p>The game offers three difficulty settings: Easy (you can jump higher and do tricks faster), Normal (a classic difficulty, like in previous games of the series), and Hardcore (the physics resembles the same of the real world). </p>\n<p>There is an in-depth tutorial called Skate.school that is accessible at any point in the game.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2010-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T21:59:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/122/1222277df1e3a000327b65d9ca45126a.jpg", "website": "http://skate.ea.com", "rating": 4.15, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 1286, "beaten": 177, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 126, "playing": 18}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 132, "ratings_count": 309, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 310, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Electronic Arts Black Box"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
