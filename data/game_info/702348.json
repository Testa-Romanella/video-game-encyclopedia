This game is<br/><br/><strong>Not a difficult competitive action game<br/>Not aimed at competing for wins or losses<br/>A loose game that is gentle, gentle, and enjoys the cuteness and forgiveness of a good old adult to play like a 3-year-old child.</strong><br/><br/><br/>There are only three basic rules in this game:<br/><br/><strong>1. Let's get along with many friends<br/>2. Collaborate with your friends to collect a lot of treasure<br/>3. If someone is crying or angry, comfort them.</strong><br/><br/>Yes, this game is a \"friendly world\".<br/><br/>However, since this is a game, there are of course some elements of competition.<br/><br/>I will introduce it below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are manipulating a creature called Elfin Clay made of magical clay.<br/><br/>They love collecting things.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, they are too shy to carry things unless their faces are hidden.<br/><br/>Let's wear something on their heads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is a 3-on-3 team battle.<br/><br/>In 5 minutes, the team that collects a lot of items on the stage wins.<br/><br/>You collect items in toy boxes prepared for each team.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When I looked up, the whale lifted the top of the toy box.<br/><br/>When the game is over, it will collect the item.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Intercepting from the other team is one of the strategies...<h3>Special actions that change with the hat</h3><br/>Elfin Clays love to wear hats.<br/><br/>Depending on what they're wearing, they can perform special actions.<br/>The charm of the game is that not all of the actions will give you an advantage in the game.<br/>Some of the special actions are meaningful, some are not.<br/> <br/>It's okay if you don't win the game. Attract them with cool actions and become a hero to everyone.<br/><br/>In addition, they accidentally fall down and cry.<br/><br/>When they are crying, Let's pet them to cheer them up.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T04:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaf35477d21256e99041d4d0f1d5738.jpg", "website": "http://uncompanygames.com/dorobo/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unCompany games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sonorite"], "esrb_rating": null}
