So he decides to go out in search of it believing that he has absolute control over the dangers of the outside world. However, soon he will discover that this is not the case. Will he be able to make his way through the dangers of leaving in quarantine and return home healthy and with his sacred roll?</p><p>The game we developed is a Metroidvania, that is to say, it presents a number of pieces interconnected between them to create a large map. Inside these a platform style gameplay will be developed, presenting jumps between platforms and dangerous hazards to prevent the player from progressing.<br/>The important point to note is the loss of control of the player over the character depending on the state in which it is, either \"Normal\" \"Affected\" or \"Infected\". Depending on the state that the player is in, the amount of control over the main character they will have. The infected state has the character moving randomly and the player having to move the environment to prevent dying.</p><p><strong>Team Members:</strong></p><p><strong>Tech Art Department:\u00a0</strong></p><p>- Karasuma Hanzo\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/karasumahanzo/</p><p><strong>Art Department:\u00a0</strong></p><p>- Lunaria Ayaren\u00a0https://twitter.com/lunyaren</p><p>- Antonio Criado\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/vitocosas_art/\u00a0https://malcriado.itch.io/</p><p>- Pekistar\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/pekistar/?hl=es-la</p><p><strong>Animation Department:</strong></p><p>- Gonzalo Lopez\u00a0\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/shaloffinc/?hl=es-la</p><p><strong>Music Department:</strong></p><p>- Lucas Schlotfeldt\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/lschlotfeldt/</p><p>- Max Brit\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/thisismaxbrit/</p><p>- Xioso\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/pancholisioso/</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1ae11a2df26232c082b9f12064564971.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karasuma Hanzo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
