Now we made it for a new matching game that easy for everyone to play.It doesn't matter if you don't understand mahjong or if you are quite good at it, and no matter how much you know about mahjong, the only thing you have to master is that you need to have a keen sight that you can pick up the same pieces of tiles as soon as you can.<br/><br/>Kungfu Mahjong is a very addictive relaxation game.Here, the object is to clear each level by matching tiles to remove them. Only the two tiles not blocked from the top can you match and clear them.<br/><br/>Do you want a go?
