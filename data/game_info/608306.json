By default the controller should be off, however the gyroscope controls are used through the mouse. The kb/m controls were not the primary focus so they are not as polished and small translations may be missing, however controller functionality works as desired.</p>\n<p>To replicate you can set up:</p>\n<p>Potentiometers on Analog ports 1 &amp; 2</p>\n<p>Buttons on Digital ports 6 and 4</p>\n<p>Gyroscope on Analog 4 and 5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb70cefea2968096ec21fed8a5dc610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Kerry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
