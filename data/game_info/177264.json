Not a challenge? Well, the game ain't gonna go easy on you, pal. If you stay quiet too much, you fall. If you move too quickly, you fall. If you move and jump at random... maybe you win? Who kno- Oops! The game just got harder!</p>\n<p>How many times will you achieve your goal until your untimely decline to the void of the glitches?</p>\n<p>Controls are simple:</p>\n<p>WASD to move, Space to Jump, Mouse to Look around, ESC to ragequit (u mad?).</p>\n<p>I'm planning on adding more features to it, so don't be shy! I'm open to suggestions! :D<br/></p>\n<p>It's my first game on Unity, and very proud of it (just 25h. of production to make it playable enough).</p>\n<p>Also, I'm not able to test Linux &amp; Mac at the moment. If you should run into any problems, I can't be of much help, but I'll get better at it with time!
