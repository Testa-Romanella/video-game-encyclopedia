{"id": 56088, "slug": "killer7", "name": "killer7", "name_original": "killer7", "description": "<p>Killer7  (stylized as killer7) is a 2005 action-adventure video game for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Capcom. The game was written and directed by Goichi Suda, also known by the nickname Suda51, and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi.<br />\nThe game follows an elite group of assassins called the &quot;killer7&quot;. The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. Killer7 features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to Myst and Snatcher.<br />\nKiller7 was Suda51&#39;s first game released outside Japan. It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex noir plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. However, the game&#39;s soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics and considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations. Despite these setbacks, Killer7&#39;s cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51&#39;s older works and the successful launch of No More Heroes.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2005-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-15T21:39:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3cd/3cd0ecac1ed63a949a14e21b2e22eb9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.28, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 65, "owned": 455, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 62, "dropped": 26, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 77, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "GameCube", "PC"], "developers": ["Engine Software", "Grasshopper Manufacture"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom", "NIS America"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
