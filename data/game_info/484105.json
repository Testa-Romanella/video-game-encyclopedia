The note says the device is an IC PUNK, used to hack circuits. You decide to follow the note's instructions. What's the worst that could happen?</p>\n<p>Extra Translation: All the in-world text is in one of two written languages, TWC and Sendralese. (They don't actually say anything, though. They're just decoration.)</p>\n<p>Extra Retro: I'm using a 4-color palette called Dream by Brandon James Greer. It's not technically one of the given palettes but I hope it still counts.</p>\n<p>AS OF NOW THIS GAME IS STILL VERY WIP. I just wanted to upload something playable early.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/7337a13e48120cb00c3fdd711643b4cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gamma_delta"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
