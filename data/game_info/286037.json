Do not open if you are minor by your country's laws.</p><p>So, this is a lewd version of the grand-grand-mother of all video games - Pong.\u00a0 You have a half-nude girls instead of rackets and must bounce ball off tits. Also it wouldn't bounce by itself, you should repel it manually in due timing.</p><p>I am still trying different web engines. This time I used Phaser. Well, it is somewhat better than lot of other things but still very clunky and uncomfortable to use. I've used it's build-in physics but honestly I shouldn't - it is not in working state, glitching constantly, failing to resolve simplest collisions and well, not something anyone should use. But it was too late already when I got all that issues so I was too lazy to rewrite it with my own code(even if it is that simple).</p><p>Anyway, enjoy this stupid lewd mini-game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T14:19:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d5c2698cb301984676c740e09aa98a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Murabito-H"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
