Eventually, you'll be delivering furniture.</p>\n\n<p>The game doesn't have any puzzle aspects, it's a purely play and relax kind of game. You are free to build whatever you want, and as soon as you are done with the main story line, you will get one last building (the splitter), which allows more complicated builds. The game does not have an end, feel free to create mazes of conveyers and factories that produce large amounts of furniture.<br/><br/><strong>Features<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Infinite procedural map</li><li>Music and sounds</li><li>Unlimited amount of saves</li><li>Multiple difficulty levels / map generation presets</li><li>Progressive contracts and unlocked factories</li><li>UI scales with the screen size</li><li>100% custom made pixel art sprites</li><li>Dumb furniture names</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>Sound effects and Music from https://www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/102/10253f861de77d36ce235ad1667517da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["frostblue", "Reezer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
