I had to use Unity too to speed up the development... I really wanted to use my engine T_T... I didn't have time to even pick a better name for the project xp <br/> <br/>Anyways, with the little time that I had I was able to make something /o/ It's not much, the concept and art was simple enough to do it somewhat fast, but I hope it's at least fun! <br/> <br/>I'm sorry there is no BGM, I actually tried to make something, but I just didn't have enough time... Also sorry for the project being so big, don't know what happened there O.o<br/> <br/>I hope you enjoy playing it! And remember to comment so I can play your game too!! <br/> <br/>Congratulations to all!! <br/> <br/>/***************************************************************************/ <br/> <br/></p><p>Announcements:<br/>- To be posted: Walkthrough, Post-mortem<br/>- For some reason the web build is all broken...
