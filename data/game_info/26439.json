When that happens, \n      surrounded tiles disappear and surrounding tiles change colors, allowing \n      chain effects to trigger combos for massive points. You can play for \n      long matches, surviving against the increasing difficulty, or just go \n      all out on a huge single move combo for millions of points.\n    </p><p>\n      Relax, enjoy and welcome to Primrose.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60addaa39e5704acf401ed5e2758d161.jpg", "website": "http://www.primrosegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Jason Rohrer", "Sabarasa Entertainment"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sabarasa", "Sabarasa Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
