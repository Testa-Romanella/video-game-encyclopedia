It is the first game in the Space Quest series. It quickly became a hit, selling in excess of 100,000 copies. Total sales are believed to be around 200,000 to date, not including the many compilations it has been included in.<br />\nSpace Quest was the brainchild of Sierra programmers Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe, who had worked on prior titles like King&#39;s Quest II, but had not designed their own game before. According to Murphy, &quot;at that time (1985), everything at Sierra was so somber and had an almost medieval atmosphere. So we decided &#39;Why not make a fun, silly game?&#39;&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T11:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/625aaad2124967b7a32c083c40f63755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 11, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line"], "esrb_rating": null}
