Sylvie Lime was commissioned by Indiepocalypse, and is currently an \"Indiepocalypse exclusive\" which you can get by purchasing Indiepocalypse #34 for $15! <br/></p>\n<p> Alternatively, I am offering a promotion where I give out a limited number of free copies of the game for people who can't buy it (see below). To make this free copy feature work properly, I need to set a price for Sylvie Lime, so I set a really high price that nobody would pay. Sorry for being confusing.</p>\n<p>When the Indiepocalypse exclusivity period is over, the game will just be downloadable for free from this page and the page won't be confusing anymore.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T15:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad5/ad5919eac080d191182b27411fa41352.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sylvie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
