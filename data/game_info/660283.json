If an\u00a0option is selected (i.e.. chocolate chip cookie, oatmeal raisin cookie, cold milk and/or warm milk) more than zero, then the order is\u00a0placed, then the order box will show what options were selected.<br/><br/></li><li>In the image above, you can see if you select more than one cold milk, for example, the bottom left of the order box will be white. If an option was not selected when the order was placed (count is zero for that option), then that respective spot would be black.</li><li>But it will NOT show how many! <em>The cook keeps forgetting that part.</em> <br/>That is why you need to remember what you ordered and for who!<br/><br/><br/>Order Examples</li>\n<li>In the above images are examples of different orders that were placed.<br/>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key:\u00a0</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>CCC </strong>= Chocolate Chip Cookie</li>\n<li><strong>ORC </strong>= Oatmeal Raisin Cookie</li>\n<li><strong>CM </strong>= Cold Milk</li>\n<li><strong>WM </strong>= Warm Milk</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>A: Nothing was placed. So all black! <em>(This order box should be thrown away.)</em></li>\n<li>B:\u00a0Only CCC. At least 1.</li>\n<li>C:\u00a0Only ORC. At least 1.</li><li>D:\u00a0Only CM. At least 1.</li>\n<li>E:\u00a0Only WM. At least 1.</li>\n<li>F: Only CCC and ORC. (All cookies) \u00a0At least 1 each.</li><li>G:\u00a0Only CM and WM.\u00a0 (All milk) At least 1 each.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Make sure you remember the amount per order box!!</li><li><strong>Hot tip</strong>:\u00a0You can gauge how much is in an order based on how long it takes for it to be prepared.\u00a0<ol><li>Each option takes a different X amount of time to be prepared. The total prep time is the sum of all the different amounts times their respective quantity amounts.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Warm milk takes the longest to prepare followed by oatmeal raisin cookie, chocolate chip cookie and, finally, cold milk.</li><li>In short, an order with 1 cold milk will be a lot faster than an order of 9 cold milks.</li></ol></li></ol>\n\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n<ul><li>For some reason I have to set canvas to 640w by 680h for webGL in this\u00a0 itch.io page\u00a0to fit page properly, but the\u00a0game was made in 64 by 64 pixels.</li><li>The game is not fully finished. There was a lot I wanted to put into it, but there is not enough time in the day, nor stamina for an old man in a young body! (haha)</li><li>I wish I had time for a tutorial or video explaining how to play.</li><li>Screenshots are a little outdated, but they hold the same kind of information.</li><li>Yes I submitted late, not because of procrastination, but because I scoped too big for something I haven't done in a long time. Lot of stuff I had to learn, but this only means that next I can be faster ;) Also \"Better late than never\"</li></ul>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>Some sound effects from Zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T17:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ba/0ba3f932406ba3ba732e8169afed9dfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Code The Muffin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
