The game was made by students at SMU Guildhall who are graduating in May, 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. This is a difficult time for everyone.  We decided to make Rhome and our other recent releases free for two reasons:  1) With a challenging job market, we wanted to show off the students' hard work to as wide an audience as possible.  2) Everyone stuck at home could use some fun, free entertainment.<br/><br/>If you are one of the gamers who supported our students and purchased the game, <strong>we thank you</strong>.  Proceeds go directly to the students to help offset some of the extra development costs of making and publishing the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-25T01:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2d/b2ddf777d106fa87df6643bdad16142b.jpg", "website": "http://rhomegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "esrb_rating": null}
