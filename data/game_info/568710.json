This was my first ever game jam submission after 1 year of studying game programming so I\u00a0was very excited to give it a go and see what I\u00a0could come up with in such a short amount of time. It's definitely not the best it could be but given the short amount of time for the project as well as managing other uni projects I feel as though it is in the best general state I could get it before the end of the jam.\u00a0Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Programming and Game Design by iMiles</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>A Bit Of Hope provided by David Fesliyan<br/>https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</p>\n<p>Art:<br/>Character Sprites provided by Goldmetal<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/simple-2d-platformer-assets-...<br/>Environment Sprites provided by Blackspire<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/nature-pixel-art-base-asse...<br/>Button Sprites provided by That Witch Design<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/simple-button-set-01-153979</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb9184115bfbfecf1f86dacfed021573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iMiles"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
