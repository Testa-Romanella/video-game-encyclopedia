The series of artworks are inspired by the events and emotions throughout my 2020. And each artwork was painted in VR using a custom tool that records every brush stroke, every colour change, every mistake and every changed direction.</p>\n<p>The gallery also contains a secret room that will only be unlocked at a specific future date.</p>\n<p>PS. setting your clock ahead won't work ... it asks a server if it is time to unlock yet or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/2996a7a395dc42fb670d14953bb6cf39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
