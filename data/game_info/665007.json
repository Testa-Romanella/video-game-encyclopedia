{"id": 665007, "slug": "living-with-temptation-1-redux", "name": "Living with Temptation 1 - REDUX", "name_original": "Living with Temptation 1 - REDUX", "description": "Many people remember the story of Justin and Tracy: A newly married couple who hired a beautiful and sexy foreign nanny to take care of their four-month-old baby when Tracy returned to work. Players took on the role of Justin at a critical moment in his life, when difficulties between him and Tracy threatened to end his marriage, and a lack of sex had him looking at other women. The situation gets more complicated as the gorgeous young nanny, Lisa, turns out to be a temptress, with friends that encourage her to catch Justin\u2019s eye. The game required Justin to navigate a complicated situation, torn between his love for his wife and his lust for the other woman, who was living with them under one roof for the whole summer.<br />\nNow, many years after the release of the original game, we want to come back to that story and present it again with more depth. To tell the story more thoroughly, to allow the player to learn more about the characters, and to give more opportunities for arousing adventures. In addition to adding to the story, we\u2019ve upgraded all the visuals as well. All images are presented in 4K and animations now include a breathtaking 40 frames. Even the locations have been upgraded and new locations have been added.<br />\nOur plans are very ambitious. With this first release of the upgraded original game, we hope to re-ignite your love of Tracy and Lisa. Next, we hope to keep that love burning hotter and longer than ever before with multiple expansions. Next on the list will be to release an upgraded version of the much loved WIFE GONE WILDER expansion. After that, we will continue to add to the game with new scenes, new characters and locations, and new sexy fun.<br />\nSo we encourage you to try this new version. In addition to the content and visual upgrades, we\u2019ve adjusted the gameplay to involve less grinding, and more varied options for daily actions. The game should still be a challenge, but with many more ways to succeed than before. We\u2019ve worked hard to add some extra magic, and hope we\u2019ve made the whole experience something that both old and new players will love.<br />\nQUESTIONS TO BE ASKED<br />\nImagine that you haven\u2019t had sex with your wife for almost a year. Are you going to fight to reclaim Tracy\u2019s passion, or are you going to take a different path and focus your efforts on Lisa, the young nanny?<br />\nAre you ready to watch your wife being the center of attention in an aroused crowd of horny men, stroking their dicks as they watch her? Will you let her make them cum, or keep her all to yourself?<br />\nHave you heard about the \u201cno touching\u201d rule? The rule states that if you don\u2019t touch someone other than your wife, it\u2019s not cheating. But is it still okay if you masturbate and ejaculate all over another woman\u2019s young and perky tits? You decide\u2026</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T15:24:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4f0/4f0e28ba865ff1d24a659f87ab26503c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 511, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lesson of Passion"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lesson of Passion"], "esrb_rating": null}
