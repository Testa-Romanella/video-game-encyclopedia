It may not be top-notch quality, but I still like it.</p>\n\n<p>STORY:</p>\n<p>You are Cheesemouth Suckerpop, otherwise known as Capybara Carl's mortal enemy. Frank Suckerpop, your extremely annoying and sucky younger brother, plays the role of phone guy, calling you to guide you through your first week at Capybara Carl's Pizza Place.<br/></p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>A to close left door.</p>\n<p>D to close right door.</p>\n<p>Q to light up left door.</p>\n<p>E to light up right door.</p>\n<p>Click on things. That should be obvious.<br/></p>\n<p>Use the BIBLE when animatronics are at your door and it is open. To use it click on it. To cancel, press S. Then, spam click the bible until it opens. There will be a 10 second cooldown. If used on the third night, it will end their run and short-circuit. Chuck must be at your door with it closed for it to work on him.</p>\n<p>Once you beat the night, or lose it, click the stop icon before you get jumpscared, and remember the code the night gives you if you win. Start the project again with the flag, click the\u00a0'Continue' button on the title screen and then enter your code to move onto the next night.</p>\n<p>There will be a different ending based on whether or not you used the bible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:58:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/1196ad4d05a68b069b3818c9fdd08d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RayFwafwa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
