We will be adding tons of new features to the game in the coming months as well as supporting more games.  We\u2019re always listening to player feedback on how we can make the game even more awesome in future versions.  Please join our Discord or use the feedback tools in the app to lets us know your thoughts!<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>Taunt is the best way to watch esports: a game that challenges you and your friends to compete against each other (and the rest of the world) during live matches. Rally behind your favorite pro players and teams to prove that you know the game better than anyone else.<br/><br/>During a game, you\u2019ll answer real-time curated challenges about events that just happened. You\u2019ll also play cards to make predictions about the game, boost your points, or mess with fellow players. Make the right calls and you\u2019ll soar to the top of the leaderboards. Miss too many, and your friends might rub that loss in your face.<br/><br/>Winning in Taunt is more than just a top score on the leaderboard during a match. You\u2019ll be rewarded based on your performance, giving you new, fun ways to play the next time your favorite teams and players are facing off on the stage. Whether you\u2019re fighting for first in the world, trying to beat your friends at your watch party, or just adding a twist to watching games at home, Taunt always makes watching esports a lot more fun.<br/><br/>Taunt currently supports League of Legends NA LCS and Worlds live games.
