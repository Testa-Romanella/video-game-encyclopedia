Then, the player will start losing health.  Energy is also used as ammunition, as well as a currency for upgrading existing weapons and obtaining new weapons.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers can distribute Energy to their personal styles, such as allocating a large amount to challenge bosses head-on, or take another route, where weapons are upgraded to deal massive damage to bosses, but the bosses can also one shot you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe have also added tons of unique monsters in the ever-changing landscape of the game, such as meandering underground caves or endless plains.   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThey all have unique attribute attacks, which can only be countered by carefully planning and adjusting Energy values.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6e0ec1f26bd8f671ce3515ca0e5f39.jpg", "website": "http://www.erisle.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 110}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 499, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Expect Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Expect Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
