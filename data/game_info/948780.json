You are a frustrated thirty-something wannabe writer from Warsaw who decides to make something out of himself. You will amaze the literary world with your earth-shattering book about refugees. It will inspire crowds and galvanize hearts, and expand minds, and change the world in all the right ways.</p>\n<p>Before you prepare your Pulitzer Prize acceptance speech, there is only the trivial matter of actually travelling to Africa to gather some notes for the story. You have an ingenious plan to smuggle yourself onto one of the illegal boats that travel to Europe from the shores of Africa while pretending to be a refugee yourself. Surely nothing can go wrong and you are NOT completely out of your depth. Surely.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The uniqueness of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>A Modern, Relevant Setting</em></strong></p>\n<p>The game concerns the refugee crisis at Europe\u2019s southern borders, a very real problem we have been facing for several years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>A Richly Woven story</em></strong></p>\n<p>The complex, multi-layered script comprises nearly 2 million characters, the equivalent of 3-4 novels.

This way, the player discovers both the player discovers both the refugees\u2019 journey and a writer\u2019s challenges of exploring the subject.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Authenticity and Factuality</em></strong></p>\n<p>Based on true events, the writing process was preceded by a series of interviews with refugees who were familiar with the concept for the game. To make this possible, the writers team visited the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, where the prototype of the game was presented to refugees and volunteers. The script was also reviewed by experts from relevant NGOs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T11:36:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca7/ca7a7b1668d98faeb82bebaf0f5fb5e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polyslash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
