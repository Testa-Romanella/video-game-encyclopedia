You play as Viktor Kane, who is searching for a powerful and dangerous traitor named Zigurait.<br/><br/>Take on Zigurait's guards in an enemy territory as you search for his location. Eventually you'll find awesome items and unlock powerful spells so that you can attempt to take on Zigurait after defeating enough of his guards.<br/><br/>Items drop off of defeated enemies, and they are critical to your success. Try to select items and spells that work well together so you can specialize your character. A mage character, for example, would use offensive spells and wear items that are high on Intellect and Spirit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d910f9103c72d567754229dc56337396.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cronotek"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
