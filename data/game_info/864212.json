{"id": 864212, "slug": "lovecraft-locker", "name": "Lovecraft Locker: Tentacle Lust", "name_original": "Lovecraft Locker: Tentacle Lust", "description": "<p>Lovecraft Locker: Tentacle Lust is a casual strategy adult game loosely inspired by the original Tentacle Locker by Hotpinkgames from 2018. We&#39;re a huge fan of tentacles stuff in NSFW/adult games, media, and art, as well as Lovecraftian horror as a whole.</p>\n<p>You are a naughty tentacle god and your goal is to capture girls through tentacle lockers. You get a lewd thing called &quot;LUST&quot;  whenever a girl exits the locker after cumming. Lust is indicated by the pink bar on the right side of the game&#39;s screen.</p>\n<p>Once it fills up, you&#39;ll level up and gain &quot;ability points&quot; which you can use to buy new lockers. When you start the game, most lockers are empty. You need to buy new lockers to eventually fill them all. The basic tentacle locker starts with small buds, and will eventually mature in 2 days.</p>\n<p>However, it&#39;s not all fun and horny, as when another girl watches you abduct an innocent girl in front of them, they&#39;ll report you to the school!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T03:09:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e60/e609e5a37c580ca9d1ea364c179f438f.jpg", "website": "https://strangegirlstudios.com/", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 265, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 101, "dropped": 16, "playing": 64}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 145, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 158, "platforms": ["Linux", "Android", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Strange Girl Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Strange Girl Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
