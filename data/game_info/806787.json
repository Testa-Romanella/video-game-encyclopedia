To put a stop to this madness, an internal team of scientists within the organization (who do not agree with the figurehead\u2019s ideals) have developed a modified data chip in secret with hopes of implanting someone who can help their cause.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The one who is implanted with this chip is the only hope for defeating this organization from the inside out. Only they can truly discover and destroy what lies beneath (within the secret underground lab facility in which these experiments and procedures are taking part).</p>\n<p>Developed By:<br/>Garret Browning<br/>Elyot Lamb<br/>Louis Miguel Moldez<br/>Gabrielle Marie Rivera<br/>Kniel Francis Sullera<br/>Mark Taylor</p>\n<p>[Prototype Demo]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T01:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/54247cf8b6d0628acba2a81362d7473a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garret Browning"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
