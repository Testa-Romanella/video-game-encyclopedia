A 70's porn movie meets a 80's horror movie meets a 90's role-playing video game. Join the hero Doug Fooker as he tries to find a way to escape a town full of zombies and mutants. A military accident has spread a gas throughout the town that turns the majority of the population into zombies or mutants and the gas makes everyone horny. Explore the town fighting and f**king zombies in a sexual-psychologial horror that will have you horny, laughing, and confused. A benefit of the game is that you only need one hand to play. Multiple interactive sex scenes are within the game that are re-playable. Sex scenes are also randomly generated so you never know when or where a sex scene will appear.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T03:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71b45a5324aa3eb3897e9226d6a5aae8.jpg", "website": "https://feraltermite.blogspot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Feral Termite"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Feral Termite"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
