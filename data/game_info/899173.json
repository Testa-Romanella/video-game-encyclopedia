Now you are on thin ice and just want to get back to your friend on the shore.</p>\r\nGame Play\r\n<p>Control your skates with the left and right buttons. Alternate left and right to speed up. Hold to turn. You haven't exactly learned to stop yet, but if you start turning circles, you will eventually slow down. You can walk on the snow, but it is very slow.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Music composed by Vince Guaraldi\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Christmas Time Is Here</em>\u00a0arranged by\u00a0@Gruber\u00a0</p>\n<p>3d effects:\u00a0@Mot's\u00a0Instant 3d Plus Library\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0@thattomhall\u00a0for advice on the ending\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything else by\u00a0@bikibird\r\n</p>\n<p>Created for the\u00a02022 Advent Calendar\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:53:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c4f6ede07c37d5c31ba9b13293a6c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jenny Schmidt"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
