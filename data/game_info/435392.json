This knowledge, if given to the masses would shake the world, and those in power will do anything to stop you. However, you can't possibly keep silent about this. And besides, even if you die, others will still have the information, and they can pass it on too. What matters, is that the hope, the rebellious flame, the spirit is kept alive.</p>\n<p>-GAMEPLAY-<br/>Your goal is to spread information, and rack up as much TDAS (Thought-Damage Assesment Score) as you can. The more people who are on your side, the faster the TDAS will increase. To make people join you, stand next to them and talk. The longer you talk, the more convinced they will become (indicated by the meter above their heads). However, don't think that the folks in charge would let you speak your mind in peace. That's perposterous! When your group amasses enough people, the Threat Level of your continued rebellion will increase, and more hazards will be sent your way. Good luck, and keep the spirit alive!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:14:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c083e0c1b1f081751a51acb6893d9d0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aridai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
