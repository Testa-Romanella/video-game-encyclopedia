Once we come to a conclusion, we then become biased toward the belief that we hold. When we experience new events, we tend to remember the events that confirm those beliefs and ignore the events that don't confirm.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSuperstitions are formed exactly like this. This game shows one such superstition. There is a belief that whenever a cat crosses the road, and you walk by just after that, something bad happens. People who hold on to such beliefs, tend to remember only the instances whenever something bad happened after a cat crossed the road. They will ignore all the instances whenever anything good happened after a cat crossed the road. \r\n</p>\n<p>There is a famous saying in statistics that\u00a0\"Correlation does not imply causation.\" Just because two events occurred together, doesn't mean that one caused the other.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY?\r\n<p>Play this game as an experiment. Each time move the boy using the right arrow key toward the bandit. Before the boy goes near the bandit the cat would have either crossed the road or not. The bandit will either kill the boy or not. This observation is noted in a matrix. After conducting the experiment multiple times you can come to the conclusion whether the cat is responsible for the bandit killing the boy.</p>\r\nREFERENCES\r\n<p>Confirmation Bias<br/>Faulty Generalization<br/>Correlation does not imply causation</p>\n\r\nSprites CREDIT\r\n<p>Boy Sprite by pzUH<br/>Cat Sprite by Elthen's Pixel Art Shop<br/>Bandit Sprite by\u00a0Sven</p>\r\nBackground Music CREDIT\r\n<p>Background Music by\u00a0joshuuu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:01:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda1eb0d22a699e44dea5dc096a92f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["systemssid"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
