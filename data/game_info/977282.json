The way that this is done, however, differs drastically depending on the approach of the player. Choose widgets that fill the bar in unique ways. Whether it be a button that can be pressed, a lever that can be pulled, or an unstable device that fries electronics, there are many choices on how to fill the bar. However, the more bars that you complete, the more difficult they become to fill. Upgrade your widgets and customize them with attachments to keep up with the bar. Once it is no longer possible to fill the bar, you can claim the rewards of filling bars and empower your bar-filling abilities on your next run!
