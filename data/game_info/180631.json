I wanted to train by making this game and I wanted to share it. May add custom music, but I'd rather just go royalty free and add credits. All input welcome, try to keep it constructive if possible. I placed in early access because I want to add more features to make my first game a more complete experience. I will update this game as I learn more or have an itch to add a feature. If it's requested by anyone I will make a full update schedule. Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdf/fdf356ffb67392087da3d5899a542962.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adragon9"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
