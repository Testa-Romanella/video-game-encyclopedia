{"id": 104186, "slug": "transition-level", "name": "Transition Level", "name_original": "Transition Level", "description": "<p>This is a VR game I\u00a0made for a university project earlier in January 2018. I tried to articulate my day to day experience as a trans woman in the form of a video game. What you see here is a rough prototype for what a full video game of this experience would be like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game has been developed soley for use with the HTC Vive. Use with other VR Headsets as well as non-VR play will not run correctly.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: Use the HTC Vive\r\ncontroller's touchpad to navigate to where you'd like to move and\r\nthen click the touchpad.</p>\n<p>Grab: Use the buttons on\r\nthe side of either HTC Vive controller to grab a hold of objects.</p>\n<p>Use: Use objects such as a\r\nphone, door, or clothes by pulling the HTC Vive controller's\r\ntriggers. Some objects will need to be held to use.</p>\n<p>Walkthrough:</p>\n<p>Please consult this\r\nwalkthrough only if you are confused about what to do in the game.</p>\n<p>Bedroom: Answer the\r\nringing phone by grabbing it and using it. Leave the room once all\r\naudio has played by using the door.</p>\n<p>Store: Grab a pair of the\r\nfolded clothes and take them to the dressing room. Close the dressing\r\nroom door and use the clothes to try them on. Look in the mirror to\r\nsee how you look, only to find that you can't see yourself. Leave the\r\nclothes store by using the door at the start of the level.</p>\n<p>Bathroom: Choose one of\r\nthe gendered restroom doors. After entering the bathroom, use the\r\nsink, optionally, use the hand dryer, as well. Leave the restroom by\r\nusing the door near the start. Again, note that you can't see\r\nyourself in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Bedroom (Return): Look in\r\nthe mirror and find that you can now see yourself. Wait for audio to\r\nplay and then exit the game by using the door.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Modeling, Animation, Level\r\nDesign, Programming, and Voice Acting by Raven Mulvany</p>\n<p>Additional Voice Acting, Play-testing, and\u00a0Programming Assitance by Katie Fisher</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3b174f68928394ad30f29e9357e08e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AKA Y"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
