Are you a fan of higher dimensional objects like klein bottles and hyper-toroids? Do you also enjoy 5D Chess, but think it could really use an extra dimension?<br/><br/>Well then this is the game for you. The game mixes 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel by Conor Peterson with a 4D Chess board as a 4x4x4x4 chess tesseract. Since we're adding a whole TWO extra dimensions to 5D Chess, this is thus 7D Chess. *Note* This is an offline, desktop port of my VRChat world made with the same name. At the moment, this does not have networking. Click pieces to visualize where they go, wasd to move around, hold right click to move around like in the Unity Editor.</p>\n<p>For the best experience, if you have a VR headset check it out in VRChat. It has links to video tutorials, networking, and is highly optimized. This exists more of as a tool for that world rather than a standalone game until networking is implemented. It is not quest compatible, but networking will come with better version control and a quest standalone branch.<br/><br/>Since there is no tutorial or rules listed in game, I highly recommend checking out 5D Chess if you are unfamiliar with multiverse time travel. The majority of rules involving multiverse time-travel are directly inherited from that<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb3cfc4b8c810d4fbed53d2a23b5f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blake447"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
