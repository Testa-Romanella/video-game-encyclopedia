Also some of the things in my code could be scripts but I prefer not using them although I would suggest using them.</p><p>Sorry for the fact the game is only for Windows :(</p><p>Sorry again for the number of files you have to download but the game takes up less than 1 mb so these files should download in seconds and the files will hopefully all download to the same folder.</p><p>But from what i have heard the game is very fun and i am happy for this news :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArrowBlox Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
