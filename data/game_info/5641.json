{"id": 5641, "slug": "resistance-fall-of-man", "name": "Resistance: Fall of Man", "name_original": "Resistance: Fall of Man", "description": "<p>In Resistance: Fall of Man, the U.S. and Britain band together in a last-ditch effort to save Europe and Asia from a horrific scourge. In mere decades, the Chimera - a species of unknown origin propagating a virus that converts other life forms into more Chimera - has overrun Russia and all of Europe. Humanity\u2019s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale. Resistance: Fall of Man draws players into a deep, frightening story that rewrites the 20th century and pits the United States and Britain against a horrific species of unknown origin. </p>\n<p>In addition to an epic single player campaign, the game features co-op, split screen multiplayer and highly customizable online gameplay. Greater processing power on PlayStation 3 and Blu-ray technology enables more immersive visual and sound effects in Resistance: Fall of Man, heightening the chaos of large-scale warfare. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles with a proprietary physics system to create a unique human and alien arsenal.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2006-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T21:55:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6ec/6ec7f7d32d1bd0ad3484af83b1e5b6b1.jpg", "website": "http://www.resistancefallofman.com", "rating": 3.66, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 27, "owned": 36, "beaten": 101, "toplay": 37, "dropped": 21, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 664, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 95, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Insomniac Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
