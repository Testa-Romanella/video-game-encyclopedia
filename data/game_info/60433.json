The 'SAT CAM' pickup will always be in the city somewhere, so finding and collecting this should be your first priority. <br/><br/>Finding this hard?<br/>No problem, 'Drive Evade' (Casual Mode) allows you to play from the 'SAT CAM' view point from the very start without any pickups.<br/><br/>*New content will be added throughout early access and this description will be updated as such", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46ee1705b11256cb10d5bbff3265e7ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreatherGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GreatherGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
