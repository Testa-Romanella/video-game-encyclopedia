This is accomplished through fast-paced minigames requiring the coordination of both players on your team to set up. The game currently features baking cakes and the first team to work together to bake three cakes the fastest wins.<br/></p>\n\n<p>My roles in this game were designer and programmer.</p>\n<p>As a designer, I came up with the mechanics for minigames to keep things feeling fast frantic and fun. \u00a0I also helped design a kitchen seen to encourage frantic cooperation between you as a friend. \u00a0The basics of our game were a feeling of frantic pace as well as cooperation and all of my design decisions played into this.</p>\n<p>As a programmer, I created the physics for how objects move around the screen and handle collisions. \u00a0I also created two of the minigames the oven game and the mixing game. \u00a0This involved writing some scripts to use unique phone mechanics such as detecting the difference between\u00a0a tap and a swipe in a specific position and calling the vibration of the phone which was very interesting. \u00a0I coded this game in C# using the Unity game engine.</p>\n<p>In addition, I \u00a0coordinated with a musician from outside our team to implement sound effects and music into our game and published\u00a0on the Google Play Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa1ece1d519dd48646f1fad82a63dd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlexChapp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
