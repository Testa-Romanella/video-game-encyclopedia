We would like to know.<br/><br/>Here are the answers to some questions I know you may have:<br/><br/>1. Why the Icon with a guy shouting? If you play the game to the end, and you don't make that face at some point, something might be wrong with you. This game is very challenging. If you do complete all the missions, that's REALLY impressive. You should be proud. Something I have not been able to do. Please please send me a screenshot or post it to twitter with #zerocar<br/><br/>2. Why are some cars secret and what are the secret cars? To make the game more interesting. Gigawatt is my favorite. Hint : \"Where we're going, we don't need roads . . .\"<br/><br/>3. The game does not work on my device, what do I do? You can adjust the settings to lower quality.<br/><br/>4.  Why is the file size so huge?  Because the game contains many graphic elements that require space.<br/><br/>5. Why do the cars have weird names?  Because they do.<br/><br/>6. Do you like hobbies?  Yes, do you?<br/><br/>The game looks better when you play it than it does in the video and the screenshot.<br/><br/>We would not recommend this game unless you have a relatively powerful device.<br/><br/>If you don't like the game, just delete it. Sorry for wasting your time.<br/><br/>We really hope you enjoy this 3D game. Its fast, fun, entertaining, frustrating, and really good.
