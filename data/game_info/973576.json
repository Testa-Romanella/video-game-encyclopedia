The story does not take itself seriously and aims to make fun of the DnD and RPG genres. <br/><br/>If you enjoy turn-based RPGs, and like strategy-based battles where levels are gained through completing specific tasks and quests, then you will enjoy this game.<br/><br/><br/>- Fully 3D maps and dynamic scenes<br/>- Charming, funny and large cast of characters<br/>- Charge-turn battle system<br/>- Useful skills and strategy based battles<br/>- ~6 Hours of gameplay, ~20 hours for 100% completion<br/>- New Game +<br/>- Many Side quests<br/>- Multiple Endings and a Secret Ending<br/><br/><br/>The war between The Cyrene League and The Barcanid Empire has been raging on for some time now, and the tension has reached a breaking point. Recently, The Barcanid Empire hired the talents of the evil duo: The Chronomancer who has the power to control time, and The Black Knight who can defeat entire troops with one blow.<br/><br/>In order to combat the Barcanids, The Cyrene League has procured our heroes to even the odds. With our new heroes at the helm, The Cyrene League comes up with a plan to end the war once and for all, in one final battle in The Cleaved Fields.<br/><br/><br/>The game is a short RPG that loosely mimics Dungeons &amp; Dragons mechanics, where you choose your leader of a 6 character party, each with their own unique ending. Levels are not gained through battle experience, but only by completing certain events in the story. The story does not take itself seriously and often throws in quirky jokes and charm.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T04:08:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b287c9cf5b819c386e463f1789dbd2.jpg", "website": "https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/mv3d-tales-from-atruian-fully-3d-dnd-inspired-rpg-multiple-endings.158591/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kelarly"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Kelarly"], "esrb_rating": null}
