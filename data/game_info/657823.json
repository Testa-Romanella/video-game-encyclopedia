My focus and goal in this project was to recreate a certain scene and atmosphere I had in mind, using only 3D assets. It is supposed to be experimental, again, just like Hekate, my first YAZJam project. Based on the chosen theme, the gameplay doesn't take longer than 5 minutes. So don't expect an epic story or complex gameplay.<br/></p>\n<strong>Language</strong>\n<p>The game is available in English only.\u00a0There\u00a0isn't much\u00a0text anyway,\u00a0so\u00a0you\u00a0should be\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0play it even\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0don't exactly understand\u00a0everything.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Enter to start the game</li>\n<li>Move your mouse to look around</li>\n<li>WASD or arrow keys to walk </li>\n<li>Space to jump</li>\n<li>Shift to run</li>\n<li>E or right click to pick up</li>\n<li>ESC to Quit the game</li></ul>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>Game Design &amp; Development by me (Wiebke Scholz | Hexenwerk)\r\n  </p>\n<p>I recorded\u00a0all sound effects by myself as well.
