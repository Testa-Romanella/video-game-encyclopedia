{"id": 399803, "slug": "wart-worm-wingding", "name": "Wart Worm Wingding!", "name_original": "Wart Worm Wingding!", "description": "<p><em>Wart Worm Wingding</em> is a 2-player arcade adventure for the NES. It's inspired by games like <em>Bubble Bobble</em> and <em>Dig Dug</em>.</p>\n<p>The settler's\u00a0mining operations on Irata have gone too far. The Wart Worms decide to take back the Irata underground by destroying the settlers and driving them out.</p>\n<p>This is just a DEMO that contains 30 levels and 3 boss fights. The full game, coming in 2020, will feature a full 100 levels and 10 boss fights.</p>\n<p>In order to switch between 1- and 2-player mode on the start screen, press B (this is just for the demo version.)</p>\n<p>The DEMO takes ~15-20 minutes to complete, depending on skill.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE:\u00a0I\u00a0recommend getting an original NES\u00a0controller and a USB adapter for it. You can find one\u00a0here\u00a0or\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You can use either an\u00a0Everdrive, a\u00a0PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each has <strong>mapper 30</strong> support.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0*\u00a0*</p>\n<p>Wart Worm Wingding was made possible thanks to\u00a0NESMaker, an engine developed to make NES development a reality for people who are not versed in assembly language.</p>\n<p>In order to play Wart Worm Wingding, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend\u00a0FCEUX. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper NESMaker uses for its games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up and\u00a0open the WartWormWingding.nes ROM. The game should work fine.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR MAC USERS:</strong>\u00a0Download\u00a0OpenEMU\u00a0for Mac. When you open the program, right click on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select \"Default Core.\"\u00a0Then select FCEU.\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>ATTENTION:\u00a0If you want to play the game in your browser, you can use this link:\u00a0http://koute.github.io/pinky-web/</p>\n<p>You'll still have to download the ROM and load it on the website.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Start = Enter; arrow keys move;\u00a0X = B</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Music</p>\n<p>The music in the demo is just placeholder and sourced from my other NES homebrew game Wampus.</p>\n<p>Princess Quest by\u00a0Ben Burnes (Abstraction)</p>\n<p>Pixel War 1 by\u00a0Ben Burnes (Abstraction)</p>\n<p>Save the City by\u00a0Ben Burnes (Abstraction)</p>\n<p>Out of Time\u00a0by\u00a0Ben Burnes (Abstraction)</p>\n<p>MULE Theme\u00a0by Roy Glover, translated to NESMaker by\u00a0Ben Burnes (Abstraction).</p>\n<p>To learn more about Ben Burnes's music, visit:\u00a0http://www.abstractionmusic.com/</p>\n\n<p>More from this developer:\u00a0https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:38:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8fa07baf8184f66ac8afb372777a555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
