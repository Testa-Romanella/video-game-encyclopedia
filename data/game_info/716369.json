You are one of these warriors, a resourceful fighter who slays any that dares to underestimate them. Choose the weapons that you will go into battle with to suit the situation, and dodge the onslaught of projectiles\u00a0from your enemies while you find your opportunity to strike back.</p>\n<p>This game was created by\u00a0one person\u00a0who wanted to combine the strategic nature of deck builders and the real time decision making present in bullet hells. It is still in an early\u00a0 build and new features are almost always being worked on. Comments and requests on what should be added are more than welcome, and any critiques will be taken into\u00a0consideration as well.</p>\n<p>*Current build only includes the Sword and Heart cards, future versions will contain far more variety.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d48355e15e894f5a225f460e77c866c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaylen"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
