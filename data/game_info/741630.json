{"id": 741630, "slug": "romancing-walker", "name": "Romancing Walker", "name_original": "Romancing Walker", "description": "<p>Romancing Walker is a romantic RPG that follows the story of Ryle, a young man looking for his purpose. Leaving on a journey of self-discovery, Ryle eventually uncovers not only the secret of his past, but one of world-shattering importance. Joining Ryle in his travels are a bevy of lovely ladies who he may choose to romance and bond with through interactions within the story.</p>\n<p>Romancing Walker was made in rm2k and utilizes hand-drawn anime sequences in battle, as well as pictures during important cut-scenes. The biggest draw of the game, however, is the dating simulation which allows you to bond with the other party members. The choices you make during certain scenes will either draw them closer or push them away.</p>\n<p>While the game does suffer from &#39;Engrish&#39; and bad grammar in some parts, it is considered a classic and one of the few games of its time that is complete, with a decent epic tale, interesting characters and interaction between your party. Add in the back-then great graphics in and out of battle and you have a game that is well-remembered as one of the best.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T02:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bda5d0b1cd09f316ff744c71c4ef6c33.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/5997/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
