Have fun racing through time!</p>\n<p>A man, Thomas, builds a time machine. When he was testing the machine, it blew up and sent him to the stone age. Along with Thomas, all of his other inventions were sent back through the times. Thomas is running through the different time periods to get all of his inventions and all the parts to rebuild the time machine. He needs to find the part in each time period to advance to the next. The people of the time period want to take his inventions and use them for themselves. Thomas has to dodge all of the natives of the time periods trying not to be killed. He has three inventions that got scattered throughout the times. Each one has a different thing they do. They are his goggles, watch, and rocket boots. His watch can shoot a laser that will disintegrate anything it hits, but it needs time to recharge before a second shot is fired. His goggles enhance his eyesight letting him see further. The rocket boots will allow him to double jump. He needs to get these inventions back to modern-day so he can improve the world. You beat each level by making it to the end portal. A leaderboard can be seen on the main menu which has your highest scores displayed. In the game, you jump over, shoot, and dodge enemies. Your score is increased by collecting coins through your run or killing enemies with your watch. Each coin will give you one point, and killing an enemy with your watch gives you one point. Once you make it through every time period, you win!<br/></p>\n<p>We compete in Nationals this summer!\u00a0Wish us luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384b78cbf94c6e09e72b5190d0421bf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lifelight"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
