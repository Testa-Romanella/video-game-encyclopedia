{"id": 647314, "slug": "mine-rush-itch-gutterpunk", "name": "Mine Rush (itch) (Gutterpunk)", "name_original": "Mine Rush (itch) (Gutterpunk)", "description": "<p>Mine Rush is a puzzle game inspired both by cave digging puzzle games from the '80s, but also by cave digging action game of the 2000s'.</p>\n<p>There is currently 200 levels in the game, and more coming, I am generating them as fast as I can. Each levels have been generated automatically, scored by comparing it's solutions to every other caves,\u00a0which are all\u00a0verified to be solvable. I intend to include 400 when launched in the Android app store.</p>\n<p>The game itself will be 100% free, with ads to get to see the solutions for the caves.</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ol><li>Grab all the red diamonds to be allowed to get the Exit star. Try to do it on or under the PAR, but nothing forces you too at the beginning.</li><li>Move by dragging the hero, or click-drag around the screen. It's easier to click on the hero.</li><li>Grab nearby objects (diamond, dirt, or push boulders) by touching them when standing next to them. This saves a step in many situations.</li></ol>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Sometime the controls get stuck inexplicably. It is linked to using the Timeline bar while moving</li><li>There is a lot of prompts missing (like a tutorial)</li><li>No sound off button</li><li>Some of the solutions aren't the minimal one. I am thinking of implementing a \"community solution\" option, but for now most caves are ok.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94cdd75ba13259ac8aa8d18c085e6dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gutterpunk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
