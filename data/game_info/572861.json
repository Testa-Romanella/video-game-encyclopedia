The topic \"side effects\" was implemented in the form of an \"unreliable potion\" that, when taken, can disorient you and mess up your controls, freeze you for three seconds or make your skills cost life instead of mana or fury.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:56:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a10a95d75a9152c544f375997ec8e0b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RocRac"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
