RPG Maker MZ is a nifty little engine and I appreciate how fast it let me get a game up and running. The plugin system is also great, and I enjoyed writing some custom JS code (The major one being the four corner battle screen).\u00a0 In future endeavors, I may branch out to game engines like Unity or the Unreal engine, but for now, I'm happy with RPG Maker MZ.</p>\n<p>The game was designed to be completed in under 30 minutes, and will most likely clock in at about 20 minutes. At the bottom of this readme is a guide to get you through the puzzles and some combat strategy, if you need it.</p>\r\nSoundtrack\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nStraying Minds \u00b7 Fractal Burst OST\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game: Dan Lungaro\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music: Dan Lungaro\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets: RPG Maker MZ RTP, Visustella Horror School, Horror City Hospital, Cyber Sci-Fi SFX, Crystal Cavern Asset Pack, Cyber City Exterior Pack, Tyler Warren</p>\n<p>Game Engine: RPG Maker MZ\u00a0</p>\r\nStrategy Guide\r\nGeneral Tips\r\n<ul><li>Every corner room has a Time Crystal, so don't feel too apprehensive about saving and healing up.\u00a0</li><li>Make sure to investigate your surroundings, there are free items about.\u00a0</li><li>Don't forget about the vending machine!

He can be used to heal and give items (such as soda) to Isaac. This lets Isaac use his big damage attacks, specifically the Time Bullet you gain at level 5.\u00a0</li><li>Teff's rocket launcher ability he gains at level 3 is an area effect, so it's highly effective against a group of enemies.\u00a0</li><li>If you are struggling at any point, make sure to buy additional items at the vending machines. An easy strategy to beat most enemies is to have Isaac use his special attacks while Teff gives him soda to replenish his MP.</li><li>If you want additional experience, defeat all the enemies in the top left corner room. If you defeat all of them and the nightmare creature boss, you will be at level 7, making the final boss a bit easier.</li></ul>\r\nPuzzle Answers\r\n<ul><li>Seconds in a year: 31,536,000\u00a0</li><li>Computer Quiz Answer #1: \"what is undone is undone\" (This answer is found on the statues in the top right corner of the initial room).</li><li>Computer Quiz Answer #2: \"An infinitely repeating pattern\"\u00a0</li><li>Computer Quiz Answer #3: \"SU-T3F\"\u00a0</li><li>8 is the number you seek in the top left corner room.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/3304bf83b37c0d197ca65b9815fafa1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Zami77"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
