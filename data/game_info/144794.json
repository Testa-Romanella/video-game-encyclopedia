This psychedelic collage is not for everyone, but its minimalistic clicker gameplay will not in any way stop you from enjoying the music and the visuals. This is not an idle clicker, but if you want, you can just let it run and listen to music. Achievements are overloaded with below average jokes and puns, and some pop culture references.

Just the game itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/359b3759ea591a8a172982900084fc70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kurokitsukami"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
