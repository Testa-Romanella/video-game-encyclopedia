In this mod, you have to avoid spinners, which is anything that spins and grows. There's also some new additions, such as Placeface with some text dialog as well as some new textures and code, including randomized values for the spinning and growing of sprites. Anyways, I hope you will enjoy this mod, and good luck trying to beat it!</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p><em>In a world full of spinners, no one is safe. It all started several years ago when a spinner entered Here School and affected an object. No one thought much of it at the moment, but eventually the spinners started to multiply and took over the schoolhouse, renaming it to Spin School. Now you, one of the last survivors, must get your friend's notebooks for him while avoiding the spinners before they totally take over. Can you win? I don't know, but you should try!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mod Wiki Page:\u00a0https://johnsters-baldi-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Baldi%27s_Big_Spin_Basics</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/643680955822ba1477c116ae365ad921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnsterSpaceGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
