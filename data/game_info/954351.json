In that it tightrope walks the line between mundane tweenage drama, and incomprehensible horrors that man cannot begin to comprehend. From a particularly enthused mall cop, a restaurant that should not exist, and many <em>many</em> legal documents you need to sign should something <em>anomalous </em>happen. The NC mall takes elements of Eldritch Horror, the Cthulhu Mythos, various fandom material, and a background of D&amp;D knowledge, and treats it with the same respect it treats the tweenage drama. (Which is to say very little and also with extreme angst)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to have you and your players come up with funny joke things NC can stand for. I can assure you, it is not going to be the biggest question you walk away with.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>(Requires the Game: Mall Kids to play!)\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://mr-matthew.itch.io/mall-kids\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85eb9e89de577b968dba87862631a3b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wyldrvir RPG"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
