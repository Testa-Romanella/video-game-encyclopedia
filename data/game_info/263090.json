We want to achieve an immersive experience which\u00a0stays in players mind for the rest of their lives.<br/><strong>What would you do if you could access a method to talk to someone who is no longer in this world?</strong><br/>Ipa, the protagonist, did it. And with her ability to see objects in exchange for her suffering, you must move forward to find your younger sister.</p>\n\n\r\n\u2192 Who is Ipa?\r\n<p><strong>Ipa </strong>is a girl who lost her <strong>little sister </strong>in an accident when she was young and was alone home taking care of her. She grew up with the<strong> guilt</strong>, and dedicated her life to science with the objective of <strong>sending a message</strong> to her sister.<br/></p>\n<p>Now she can access through dimensions <strong>between life and death</strong>, but she has forgotten\u00a0why she was there.</p>\n\r\n\u2192 Gameplay\r\n<p>Torii is a <strong>first-person narrative-puzzle game </strong>in which players must<br/>activate an ability to see objects that are not in the \"real\" plane (<em>gameplay can radically change, i'm working on different prototypes right now</em>).<br/>This ability, has a limited time. Is in that period of time when players must <strong>solve different puzzles</strong> to advance to the end. At this point, players must collide an<br/>enemy from the unreal plane with the Torii to pass to the next level.</p>\n\n\r\n\u2192 Interface\r\n<p>As <strong>one of the most important things</strong> in Torii is<strong> immersion</strong>, the interface is as <strong>minimalist</strong> as possible. Two bars on the top left to mark life and skill time, some dialog boxes, and the rest is integrated into the game. If life goes down, the color of the screen dims.\u00a0If we use our ability, a red filter, and marks of pain in the corners, warn us that <strong>we are suffering</strong>.</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 Esthetic\r\n<p><strong>Enviroment art is one of the main pillars of Torii</strong>. It's intended that the player feel the immersion of a dimension unknown to him, which\u00a0is full of <strong>melancholy, colors, and lighting with personality.</strong> Through levels, Torii speaks about panic, fear of failure, frustration and guilt.</p>\n\r\n\u25ba About me\r\n<p>I'm Joaquin Castro from Argentina and<strong> i love indie videogames</strong>.<br/>I studied a little bit of Graphic Design, Linguistics and Acting.\u00a0<br/>On the day of today im a programmer stundent, and with my project I want to contribute with a<strong> fresh experience </strong>to the world of videogames.</p>\n<p>Recently i've been in the finals of \"<strong>Potenciate Videojuegos 2018</strong>\" (one of the most important competitions in my country)\u00a0 and i've been exposing Torii in<strong> EVA Play </strong>(Exposici\u00f3n de Videojuegos Argentina)\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\u25ba Community\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Follow me on Instagram and Twitter for News!</li><li>I'll appreciate a lot if you leave a comment with your impressions of the project below.</li></ul>\n<p>You can <strong>download </strong>and try this demo, consider that<em> it's always changing </em>and<em> it's made by one person</em>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can always\u00a0<strong>donate whatever you want</strong> and that would be very helpful for me and my work!\u00a0</p>\n\r\n\u25ba NEWS\r\n\n<ul><li><strong>Finalist</strong>\u00a0of Potenciate Videojuegos 2018 !
