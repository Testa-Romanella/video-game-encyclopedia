Four of them descend to conduct their experiments, and one stays behind.</p>\n<p>The researchers underestimated the lethally cold environment of the planet. Only one researcher remains on the ship, stuck in orbit, the vessel's\u00a0engines frozen as the night slowly catches up with it end to front.</p>\n<p>That one remaining researcher is you, Terry. You wake up to the blaring of alarms, the signals from your companions offline.\u00a0The night is crawling ever closer, its cold claws inching in your direction. Your only chance of survival is the one last remaining Perpetual Motion Pack above the engine room, in the bowels of the ship.\u00a0Can you find it and make your way off of this deathtrap you woke up on? Can you\u00a0escape the night?</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>A, D to move left and right<br/>Space to jump<br/>Space while mid-air to dash (once you find the Perpetual Motion Pack, of course!)<br/>Tab to reload last checkpoint</p>\n\n<p>BUG ADVISORY</p>\n<p>This demo is a very early prototype of the game and there are some devious bugs hiding, biding their time to jump you. Should you find yourself stuck, press TAB to reload the last checkpoint.</p>\n\n<p>THANK YOU</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing this demo! We hope you find as much enjoyment in it as we did making it!</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Programming: Gyorfi-Deak Geza Gyorgy<br/>Art Lead: Kaytlin Parise<br/>Additional Art: Gyorfi-Deak Geza Gyorgy<br/>Sound Design: Gyorfi-Deak Gergely<br/>Extra Sound Design: Gyorfi-Deak Geza Gyorgy</p>\n<p>Engine: GameMaker Studio 2<br/>Sounds: Freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139f23f1c7e299cf5b2dfc2d0121aca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GyD Geza"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
