It\u2019s the day of the Great Harvest - a celebration of the bountiful fall harvest. But the symbol of the Great Harvest, their Golden Pear, has been broken! Will you help them re-pear their Golden Pear for the feast?</p>\n<p>Use your arrow keys to explore the village and interact with the birds! (Hint: the villagers love chatting with people! Talk to them more than once to see what they have to say!). Walk into items to pick them up.<br/>~<br/>In this environment, players can explore a small village with little characters. This is my first time creating something with Bitsy. I hope you enjoy a peaceful, casual environment.</p>\n<p>This was created for the Global Game Jam 2020.\u00a0</p><p>This game was an experiment with Bitsy, a tool made by Adam Le Doux (https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy).
