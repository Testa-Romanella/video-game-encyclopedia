Furthermore, instead of having your weapon return to you, why not return to it instead with the power of Slinki's slingshot? All this to find out what happened to the once peaceful forest you used to live in.PlotSlinki's once peaceful and smooth-running home has gone horribly wrong, with every denizen gone crooked and twisted, and irrevocably hostile. Himself affected and warped as well, Slinki can just sit there and waste away, or take the last of his strength to the Forest's Core, and end the misery whatever ill-bred rascal thought to fester in it's depths.Features <ul><li>Eliminate your enemies  with your unique bladed boomerang<br/></li><li>Have your boomerang return to you or propel yourself towards it <br/></li><li>More than one level of hot bladed arm action (10 to be exact) <br/></li><li>Fight against several unique forest critters <br/></li><li>Old-school gaming with a score counter, a timer and lives system <br/></li><li>Easter eggs (no, I mean literally)! <br/></li><li>Unlock the Hardcore mode for added challenge<br/></li><li>Controller support</li></ul>Steam Edition Features<ul><li>Behold, improved graphics!<br/></li><li>15 Achievements to keep you going<br/></li><li>Play with your se...save anywhere with steam cloud support<br/></li><li>Steam trading cards with awesome artwork<br/></li><li>Extra content including new music and a new Boss</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eea264061bf4db80c49b93964b73fb2c.jpg", "website": "http://titanforgedgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 59}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Titan Forged Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Titan Forged Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
