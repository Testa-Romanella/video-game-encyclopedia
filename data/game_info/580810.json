Learn more about the competition at\u00a0https://broumvirate.com/bhotm</p>\n<p>Choose your fighter, then choose your rock! Then, it's time to start throwing.</p>\n<p>To progress through each level, you must complete the designated objective. For levels 1-3, the goal is to throw the rock so that it lands inside the stack of large rocks, without touching any of them, while throwing the rock in the designated way: overhand, underhand, or \"granny\"-style (like how your grandmother probably bowls). For level 4, \"Bounce-bounce\", your goal is to skip the rock across the goalposts; and for level 5, \"Top\", you must land your rock on top of the tower.</p>\n<p>The game tracks your time, and it literally doesn't have a quit button, so hope you're ready to get stuck for a very long time.</p>\n<p>Programming and Artwork:\u00a0Alden Burgess</p>\n<p>Music by Jacob Sanner</p>\n<p>Featuring the likenesses of Alden Burgess, Jacob Sanner, Kai Fox, Emerson Jeffrey, and Benjamin Hagle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T08:31:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9d682e8e4916150c86883fa21a75051.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alden Burgess"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
