After Max's partner Brad is transformed in a car bomb explosion and Max is turned into an even bustier babe, Max must team up with a bunch of new and returning weirdos in order to save Axon City from a terrifyingly sexy threat. It's not going to be easy though, Max is going to have to cope with issues like her succubus sister Heather moving back in and refusing to leave despite clearly breaking the terms of Max's lease by holding orgies in the living room. Or the coven of mysterious witches that live in a compound on the outskirts of the city that claim they are definitely not a cult, and Max is turned into a dog at one point. We probably should have mentioned earlier that things are going to get weird.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>A Life-Sim/Visual Novel/Adventure Game hybrid!<br/></li><li>A completely new story!<br/></li><li>Overhauled character art!<br/></li><li>Point and Click style puzzles!<br/></li><li>Five love interests!<br/></li><li>Improved Life-Simulation elements!<br/></li><li>Over a dozen new characters!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T02:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f4094dad5ff9d025f77ff7c7715f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Lached Up Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Lached Up Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
