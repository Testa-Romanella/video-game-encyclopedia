Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A long time ago, when I was a kid, I played a lot with Commodore 16 games of an English company called Tynesoft. Unfortunately, they have since fallen into disrepair, but their games remain for us. As the world changed, so did gaming machines, and as a generation grew up, it became possible to rewrite these games to other consoles. I would like to introduce these awesome games to the people who like the Nintendo Gameboy Color. Receive with great love, and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>RAFFLES</strong></p>\n<p>Raffles leaves a bubbing champage party at his hotel in London to plunder five one mansions in the neighbourhood.
