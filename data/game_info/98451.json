He seems responsible of some people death but he can also save them, so he can be helped or killed. Be careful who you talk to and what you say\u2026 Or you might regret it. <br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you want to find the victim, you have to know who could die shortly. The best way to know it is to discuss with every villager and interrogate them. But be careful :\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>You don't want them to know you are a mazzeru\u2026</li>\n<li>The village is small, so people remember and tell each other everything.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tSometimes, the environment can be more informative than people. Stay watchful and you could find new clues to interrogate people and develop your investigation. The locations of houses and people, a graffiti, an inscription\u2026 each element of the environment can be helpful. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>/!\\ The game is still in early development.
