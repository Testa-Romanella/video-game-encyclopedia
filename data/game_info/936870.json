The game is a simple third person platformer, and the purpose of this project was to create\u00a0 a parent platform class with C++ and create blueprint child classes from that class to diversify the platforms.\u00a0 When all the elements where made, then came the challenge of creating an interactive level to play in, the game was made in the span of a couple days and the level design is reflected in that, its simple, archaic and utilitarian, but my next project will focus on level design and environmental story telling.\u00a0</p><p>Don't be a stranger, leave any feedback you might have in the comments, it is greatly appreciated! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T08:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a51c8ef8acf25eada8e71b2ac7f1e79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HungryToast"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
