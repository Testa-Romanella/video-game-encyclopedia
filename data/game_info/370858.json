Had really fun making it. ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED.\u00a0 So, you are a detective and you have to sort out the mystery around this burglar of the Twyford's cottage. You must figure out where the burglar got in, what he took and who he was. All of this you uncover by reading the game's details about the objects in the game. But keep in mind, the game does not always tell you the truth, so you need to look around and explore to find out what is true, and what is not. :D</p>\n<p>The game has almost full controller support, except for the ending.</p>\n<p>This is my second game jam I have ever participated in, the first one being the BTP Game Jam #2. This is also my second game I have ever actually completed.</p>\n<p>Okay, so as I said, please comment feedback and criticism. I know the menu is poop, but I just didn't have the time to fix that. Most of the game itself look quite good though. Please report about bugs.</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>-If playing with controller, you cannot choose what was stolen and who did it. You need to use mouse for this.</p>\n<p>-If playing on controller, the cursor can sometimes go so far away that you cannot see it. This can be fixed for now by pressing \"Y\" on the controller to bring it back to you.</p>\n<p>-If you press escape you immediately get thrown back into the menu. There should of course be a \"Are you sure?\"-text so that you don't do it by accident. And also, if you do this, the cursor will not appear again, so you cannot actually start the game over again if this is done.</p>\n<p>-Sometimes, when reading about objects close to each other and switching between them, the object will not be called by ity's name, just \"Object\" and the description will be some random stuff. If this happens, drag the cursor away from the object and then back on it and click and the description should be normal again.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41fb9a639f8a1d37100e9f982dd49af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freezerbot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
