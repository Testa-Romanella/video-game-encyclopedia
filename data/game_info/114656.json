If there are more than four tokens, you may collect two of the same type in a turn.</p><p>Use these tokens to pay for circular elements in the center.  If you're the first to collect the necessary elements for one of the bonuses in the bottom row, you will gain those bonus points.</p><p>The first player to 15 points wins.</p><p>The three AI players aren't very good yet, this is my first real attempt to make any strategic AI, so expect improvements in the next couple days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc60f7e0d8fe8f5a4ee1b32a24c8dab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamesOfJames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
