For now, there are only damage effects and creation effects. Each card has a target range which will either determine what range the creation cards can have or what enemy character it will damage (this is listed at the bottom of each card as 3 circles either filled with an X or shaded, shaded means possible targets, X means targets).</p>\n<p>If too many cards are on the stack, then a countdown to the stack clear will appear. stack clearing is a special game state where no one can play cards and all cards on the stack are resolved from top to bottom rapidly\u00a0until the stack is empty.</p>\n<p>If a character dies before their creation card is resolved, then it will fizzle (will not create anything), damage cards (like bullets and explosions) cannot fizzle.</p>\n<p>P.S Esc quits the game, there is no pause</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Character Sprites: https://willipixel.itch.io/wild-west-characters\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Please leave any bug finds, suggestions, and feedback in the comments</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T08:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab3070be712d11bc37ab59d418b8782a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BAD Halstead"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
