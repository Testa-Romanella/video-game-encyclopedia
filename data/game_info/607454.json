To make matters worse, an influx of monsters is causing havok, with Dire Wolves snatching delicious goats and Trolls throwing potatoes in dwarf toilets. Four young dwarves with character flaws take it upon themselves to investigate the mess, mostly because it's better than hanging out and waiting to starve.<br/><br/>More specifically, the game plays like a JRPG of yore, with monsters, weapons, potions, humor, magic, special abilities, big scary spiders, Orcs, Angry Moose, declining civilizations, pixel art, attitude, swamps, some steampunk stuff but not too much, beards, bone dust, secrets, did I say dwarves? Definitely Dwarves.
