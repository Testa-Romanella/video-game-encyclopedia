The main character of the game is a Swiss journalist Kevin who is trying to escape from some weird alternative reality. <br/></p><em>In year 2023 Russia declared war on China. The war lasted 12 years bringing both countries economically totally exhausted and so in 2035 the peace was negotiated. China decided to raise funds for relaunching economy through the dreaded... Requiring to pay the debts after the rest of the world. Inablity to pay caused collapse of Central Europe and in the year 2042 also USA almost bancroted. Islamic countries refused to provide USA any acces to oil whose value could put USA back on lead. And so USA along with other states starded an emergency program. Since mining most of the materials was not profitable at the time, a special program in CERN was launched . Named ARM - Alternative Reality Mining. The purpose of this program was to allow timetravel, because travelling in time creates alternative realities, realities full of oil, uranium and natural gas, realities that it is possible to mine. The concept was not completed, but it was necessary to act quickly and so in 2048 CERN introduced a prototype of a time machine Gala performance and demonstation was also present Kevin. But the whole thing, rather unfortnatelly, went wrong\u2026</em><p>\r\n\tKevin wasn\u00b4t born as hero, but he always wanted to be one! If he knew that he will be forced to be hero one day, he would be so happy. Until that day...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t And this is exactly what happened. \r\n\tHe became a penguin.\r\n</p>Some numbers<ul>\n<li>8+ hours of fun*</li>\n<li>40+ quests (some of them can be really frustrating)</li>\n<li>100+ items (<em>including Jesus Sandals, Bow of Bowing, Apple of Justice, Alphabet of Doom, ...</em>)</li>\n<li>8 types of enemies with unique combat skills (becoming even more dangerous with increasing game time)</li>\n<li>10 abilities (<em>half magical, half physical</em>)</li>\n<li>1 large island</li>\n<li>3+ little islands (depends on where you put border between <em>\"Island\"</em> and <em>\"Random rock in the middle of nowhere\"</em>)</li>\n<li>1 interactive tutorial</li>\n<li>X bugs (where <em>X&gt;0</em>)**</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\t*Granted only if you are a helicopter.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t**Absolutely granted!\r\n</p>The price<p>\r\n\tBecause my PC is really low-end machine I really need a new one (for making games that looks a little better) and since I don\u00b4t have any income (because I am 18 years old) I have decided that the price of 2$ is just right.\r\n</p>Hadware requirements<p>\r\n\tI am prety sure that EPIC can run even on a calculator. It is well optimized. In fact my PC is real low-end and still can run EPIC (with MAX settings) on 40+ FPS. But if you really want it:\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CPU: 2.0 GHz</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>RAM: 512 MB</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>GPU: 700 MHz (512 MB)</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong>HDD: 500 MB</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tEPIC was tested on many devices and performance was always great.</p>Installation<br/><p>Open the installer and follow the instructions. For correct audio output you have to install OpenAL (installation file included). </p><p>Some antivirus like programs sometimes block EPIC. Try to add exception or disable the antivirus.</p>Bugs and ideas<p>If you find any bug, any gramatical mistake (cause I am not a native speaker) or you have some idea for EPIC.
