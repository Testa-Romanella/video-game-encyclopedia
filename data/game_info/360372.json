Take advantage of the ricochet.</p><p>Each enemy hit allows you bullet to ricochet an additional time.</p>\n<p>Each time you loose you get set back one level.</p>\n<p>As you play, your gun's sight will improve and show the possible trajectory of your bullet.</p><p><strong>Note: The last two levels are quite challenging. Good luck :)</strong></p>\n<p>Update: Fixed an issue with the colliders but there is still an issue where sometimes the edge of a target does not register a hit. I\u00a0apologize\u00a0if you run into this issue. It's pretty frustrating.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T17:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c82cf2cd791fd319369b6a68b85a2d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["windowwasher"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
