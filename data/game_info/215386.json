Well, you're just that good! Though...there was that laser that nearly dissolved you that one time...and that slime you ran into face-first that other time...but, fortunately, you'd just happened to learn the perfect counter the level before. Construct the story of how you defeated the final boss without ever getting a single scratch, in this roguelike where death is not an option.</p><p><strong>Gameplay (partially aspirational)</strong></p><p>In this roguelite, instead of dying, you are sent back in time to an earlier level in the game in order to acquire an important item or ability that you can use to cheat death in the present. Right now, going back in time gives you an additional auto-deflect, but the future could include things like extra jumps to avoid spikes that you were about to land on, freeze spells to chill a crowd closing in, or a ground pound to kill the enemies you were about to land on.</p><p>Eventually, you beat the final boss (which is where the game starts), acquiring and using only the items you needed in \"past\"\u00a0levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - arrow keys</li><li>Jump - z</li><li>Punch - x (doesn't do anything)</li><li>Debug keys - a (incept), s (decept)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Test notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Only tested on Windows 10.<br/></p>\n<p>(Also, you cannot actually beat the big ol eye boss, and thus the game.)</p>\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/269476/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/jswonger/sounds/47924/</li><li>https://github.com/staffantan/unity-vhsglitch</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/16x16-cave-tileset</li><li>https://www.dafont.com/visitor.font</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/game-jam-menu-template-40465</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f93/f93b959d6cce6b4e4f0a3a76281b086f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["josef01", "inkhorse", "klaro", "Kestrad", "sparklebruiser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
