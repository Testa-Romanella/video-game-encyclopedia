I ended up recreating, from my own flawed memory, the convenience store we frequented in Tokyo, and filled it with thoughts I remembered having while I went to this familiar-yet-foreign space. There's no way to win, I like to think of this as an virtual sculpture or diorama.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T09:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bfa8782eca602fa398f5d1c27cec55d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack O'Neal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
