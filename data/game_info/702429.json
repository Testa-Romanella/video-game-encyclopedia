I asked in the discussion forum as well as researched online\u00a0and was unable to find an answer. I have added the music as a downloadable zip file as that was the only solution\u00a0I could find in order to turn this in on time. I also was unable to get screenshots without pausing in order to use command shift 4.\u00a0I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>\n<p>Created by:\r\n</p>\n<p>Sydney Upcraft\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T04:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/998cf1dd5f27f40c44838ec13c5cc75e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["slimeyslugen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
