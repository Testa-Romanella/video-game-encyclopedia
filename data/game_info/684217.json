She's your average, all-American monster hunter living after an arcane apocalypse. Hired to find missing scavengers who'd entered a haunted house, the huntress fox finds her work cut out for her...<br/></em></p>\n<p> <br/>Her world had ended nearly about fifty years ago, still caught in early 2000s stasis. Monsters and magic thought to be fantasy became a waking nightmare for those who survived. Dana, a ranger of the overgrown ruins, fights to protect and avenge such survivors. When a group of friends fail return from a house best left avoided, the investigating vixen discovers the secrets behind their slaughter... and of their eldritch assailant. <br/></p>\n<p>This is that story, and these are her problems.</p>\n<p> <br/>\"Keeper of the Fog\" is a somewhat non-linear RPG, created for RMN's Commonplace Book event.
