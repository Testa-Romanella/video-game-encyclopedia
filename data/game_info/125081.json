Currently there is only one barbershop quartet guy, but he can make three different sounds. This is currently very pre-release and is something to just mess around in for now if you want.</p><p>The controls are currently W, S, and X for a high, medium, and low note respectively. This is just the first small slice and updates will continue to happen as I continue to work with this. There may not be much now, but there will be more soon, not only in terms of sounds and the rest of the barbershop quartet, but also more animation and backgrounds.</p><p>Version 2 is now up: This features new sprites (due to technical reasons I messed up on) and a background! This entire update is all aesthetic.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c41e647f425244db75140a885602a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smedwicks"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
