The full game oughta be out by September 2016! </p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This project is on indefinite hiatus for school/work life reasons. I'll give it another shot someday!</p><p>Oh, yeah. Summary.</p><p>Unremarkable NEET <strong>Jan Ericson</strong> is the odd one out in their own home. A tragically forgettable twenty-something living off an allowance, Jan makes a better bit player than a VN narrator \u2014 at least they <em>would</em>, if not for their unlikely roommates.<br/><br/>Jan shares suites with shy, wibbly <strong>Genny</strong>; their bestie-turned-demonic-vessel who swaps personalities at the slightest provocation. Taking up additional space is the monotonous <strong>AN0N</strong>: a repurposed killer robot whom Jan reassembled upon mistaking for another appliance.<br/><br/>And as for Jan themself? They spend most days playing games and stuffing their face with Ch--tos. Natch.<br/><br/>Alas, all good things must come to an end. When the Ericsons grow frustrated with their offspring, Jan and company band together and form the general labour provider company, <em>Five-Star Freelance</em>. What will result of their hare-brained scheme? Will Genny manage to keep her (literal!) inner demons in check? Will AN0N succumb to his murderous programming? Will Jan ever regain their parents' respect?<br/><br/>Welp, there's only one way to find out...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b6808b2ffb29305da8c829188cd9eff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Candy\u2729Giants"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
