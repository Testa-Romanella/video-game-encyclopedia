If you would like to know more about TWRP and their music, please follow the following links:<br/></p>\n<p> https://twrp.bandcamp.com/music<br/></p>\n<p> https://twrp.store-08.com/featured/ </p>\n<p>______________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Deets<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is a small game development project, still in progress! If you find any bugs or problems please detail them in a comment and I will look into addressing them.<br/><br/>Currently the game consists of a Grand Prix-style racing format where you face off against 3 other AI drivers modelled after TWRP band members. Each track (of which there are 3) is themed to either a TWRP song or message, and contains little references to their music.</p>\n<p>It also contains fan art by these amazing people:</p>\n<ul><li>@atomicpitou<br/></li><li>@courtney_lunn<br/></li><li>Davide Orlando</li></ul>\n<p>The controls can be viewed under \"Options\" in either the Main Menu or any in-game Menu. <br/><br/>The game currently features 4 power-ups:</p>\n<p>1) Keytar - toss an exploding keytar!</p>\n<p>2) Speed Boost.</p>\n<p>3) Foodbar - gain a brief buff of weight, size and speed.</p>\n<p>4) Release the Kraken!</p>\n<p><strong>The Distant Future</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In time, the following are intended to be added:</p>\n<ul><li>Time trial game mode!</li><li>More items!</li><li>More tracks!</li><li>Phantom Racer game mode!</li><li>Bonus characters!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>But Also the 1980s</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This work is done in free-time, so dates cannot be guaranteed. Sorry! So far this project has taken 7 months or so, and it's my first game development project. Thank you for understanding and supporting this work!</p>\n<p>Yours Truly,</p>\n<p>Battle Stag</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65f/65fcfd7d06a2dbaec59dccf9e923e998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Battle Stag"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
