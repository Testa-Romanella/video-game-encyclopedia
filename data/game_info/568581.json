Thank you :)&gt;&gt;</strong><br/></p><p>Failure Makes Life Easier is a (very) short, heartfelt and inspirational game where you learn that failure isn't bad. This game was made in 2 days, by Jack \"jabafemal\" Mallett for the WOWIE Game Jam 3.0. This is my first \"complete\"(ish) game and my first attended game jam. I had alot of fun making the game, and I hope you have at least <em>some</em> fun playing it :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47c/47cd031118473c9d540ad3e2e512cd1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jabafemal"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
