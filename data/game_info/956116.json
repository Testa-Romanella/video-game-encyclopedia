This time, instead of developed in TurboWarp, it is made with Gandi IDE this time. Plus, I added a lot of Gandi extensions!</strong></p>\n<p>So, the plot goes by this: A young academy student, Sarah, goes on her own adventure after passing her exam and received her magician's license. But an evil queen merges into Earth and releases her minions to retrieve the negative energy to rebuilt her dark kingdom. Sarah encounters her minions and proceeds to defeat them, and so, her true, dangerous journey continues on, building her way up to become a hero herself.</p>\n<p>If you are a first-time player, <strong>PLEASE</strong> read the instructions before playing!</p>\n<p>This game is somewhat rushed, so you may experience some bugs.</p>\n<strong>Instructions:</strong>\n<p>The controls are simple here.</p>\n<p>A to jump, and S to shoot your weapon, which is your magic wand, duh. And if you have multiple weapons, press 1, 2, or 3 to switch weapons.<br/></p>\n<p>The ladder is functional but can be slightly laggy/buggy. There are some workarounds to get out of the ladder when you're stuck. You can go to your opposite desired direction and hold the jump button until you escape from the ladder. Or you can press any of the left or right arrow keys and then press up or down again to try interacting with the ladder again.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was kind of individually developed by me, but I also got help from 2 other friends from my team to boost the progress.</p>\n\n<p>I really hope you enjoyed this. A lot of effort has been put into this project. If you did, that's great then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best regards,\u00a0\ud835\udcdf\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf9\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcec\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf205.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T11:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25cdbafbc25df7489f82b7563bbbad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["\ud835\udcdf\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf9\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcec\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf205"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
