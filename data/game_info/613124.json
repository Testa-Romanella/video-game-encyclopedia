We thought about making</p>\n<p>the character only have one health, because</p>\n<p>that can be fun and fast paced. Unfortunately,</p>\n<p>that can lead to playing like a coward, which</p>\n<p>isn't fun or fast paced. It's tough.</p>\n<p>So we thought, what if your DAMAGE only had 1</p>\n<p>HP? That's weird. But we liked the idea, so we</p>\n<p>tried it. We hope you have fun playing it!</p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>===============CONTROLS================</p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>WASD -&gt; move around</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3, 4 -&gt; summon drones</p>\n<p>R -&gt; recall drones</p>\n<p>Mouse -&gt; Aim</p>\n<p>Left Mouse -&gt; Shoot</p>\n<p>Right Mouse -&gt; Nothing, stop clicking it</p>\n<p>ESCAPE -&gt; Skip level incase things get broken</p>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>It's all on-screen in-game moon2S</p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>=============OTHER STUFF===============</p>\n<p>=======================================</p>\n<p>Game programmed using Godot</p>\n<p>Art processed in Aseprite</p>\n<p>Music and sounds created in REAPER,</p>\n<p>or sampled from freesound.org under</p>\n<p>Creative Commons License 0 (no copyright)</p>\n<p>Instalock Games, 2021</p>\n<p>Moonjam - 2021</p>\n<p>twitch.tv/MOONMOON</p>\n<p>==========================================================</p>\n<p>======All immaculate coding done by deadpixelsociety======</p>\n<p>===All sick-nasty art and animations done by muffnbuttn===</p>\n<p>======All sounds, voices, and tunes done by ICWobbles=====</p>\n<p>==========================================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T10:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3d/e3d8f1c20e7901b4a0473e6180eca390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["deadpixelsociety"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
