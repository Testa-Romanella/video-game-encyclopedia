In this game, your weapon is your main source of movement, and you'll need to use your weapon's recoil to send yourself flying to the goal. Switch your current active weapon using the 1-4 number keys, move around using WASD, use M1 to fire, M2 to zoom, and Shift to sprint. When you fire your weapon, the recoil will send you flying backwards, opposite the way you fired the weapon. Use this to your advantage to reach heights and cross distances you couldn't achieve normally! Good luck, soldier, and watch for rogue robots!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T07:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/247/2470deac307ec4b2dd8d2a3eaccc3870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["8-Bit Cheapskates"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
