In this test of strategy and endurance, players will band together with up to three friends on a variety of missions and raids, securing supplies and survivors to strengthen their base camp against the threat of both the dead and the living - by any means necessary.<br />\nEach playable character has their own skill trees, squad roles, play styles and background stories. Now they all share a common objective where survival and teamwork is paramount. The action is up-close and intense: take out enemies carefully with silent melee attack or go in guns blazing. You need to be able to improvise as nothing is certain and a horde of walkers is always right around the corner.</p>", "metacritic": 51, "released": "2018-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-31T13:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/01d/01db348525b1d859e5273577dc4edd40.jpg", "website": "https://overkillsthewalkingdead.com", "rating": 2.45, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 61, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 27, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 44, "suggestions_count": 351, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 44, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["505 Games", "OVERKILL Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Starbreeze publishing"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
