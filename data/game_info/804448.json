A time of great turmoil. The once peaceful province of Yamato is in disrepair and rumours of a vast gang of dangerous bandits are said to roam the area, stealing from innocent victims and killing them in the process.\r\nTheir latest victim is, however, a little different... a shrine maiden.\r\n</p>\n<p>Assume the role of a guardian spirit in search of divine retribution. Exact revenge on those who took your life by eliminating them and decide a new fate for yourself and the land.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n- Inhabit any one of the gang members to defeat your enemies\r\n</p>\n<p>- Unique controls let you switch characters when you want\r\n</p>\n<p>- Experiment with the three hosts types to suit your playing style</p>\n<p>- Gameplay</p>\n<p>You start the game as the orb, and you have a life force which is slowly draining away. Hover over an enemy and press the attack/possess button to posses them. Then as that enemy rampage about the level killing other enemies.</p>\n<p>You can kill your host at any time and fly off to find a new host, but keep an eye on the orb energy at the top left, when that's gone it's game over.</p>\n<p>Continue until all enemies are dead</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e5b9b6ed6d3fbd1050ad9fb85118835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Splendid Fox Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
