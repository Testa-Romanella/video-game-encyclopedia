Earth scientists developed a gravity gun! Yes, that's it, you can push everywith without explosions. And now you have to do it, because during the tests scientists dramatically changed orbits of asteroids and now they keep falling on our heads. Defend Earth, stay as long as you can, push asteroids away, stay close to sun and a little secret to go... you can change Earth's orbit too with this gun! No time left, get your gravity gun and go save the planet!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c55a23bb960de65f8c11cb1020662e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikolay Z"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
