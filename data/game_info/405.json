The game is a spiritual successor of another game made by the same developer, Puzzle Quest.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>There is not much plot present in the game. The players create their character, choose their faction, and start off as a troop commander in an army of the faction they chose.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Gems of War is heavily inspired by Hearthstone and uses its core gameplay mechanic while putting its own spin on it. The players engage their enemies on the game board, by choosing specific cards. After that, a gem mini-game, similar to Candy Crush Saga, starts. The better the player completes the mini-game - the more damage will be dealt to the enemy. At this stage of the enemy encounter, the players have to put three gems of the same type in one row.</p>\n<p>After completing several battles, the players will be invited to fight in a guild. Guilds grant the players specific abilities to use in the mini-game as well as new troop cards. </p>\n<p>Several card types are present in the game. Some of them deal damage directly to the enemy or their cards, others provide upgrades to the player, while everything else serves to create additional hardships for your enemies.</p>\n<p>It is possible to play the game at multiple platforms at the same time by logging in your game account at a new device.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:56:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f8b7d7832a2e1d9b795edeccca15f2.jpg", "website": "http://www.gemsofwar.com", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 1279, "beaten": 17, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 65, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 590, "ratings_count": 143, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 143, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "iOS", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["505 Games", "Infinity Plus 2"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["505 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
