But almost no one is able to complete this challenge... At the end of the climb they have collected eight (1000 in binary by the way hehehe) fragrances along the tree to create your own and unique one.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as one of the known heroes because of his deeds in the battle of the <strong>VII\u00a0Candle's Rebellion</strong>, but this, is a story for another day....</p>\n<p><strong>----------THE LAMPSHADE ANTHOLOGY----------</strong></p>\n<p>The Lampshade Anthology is an anthology of games that I develop, during game jams, that is part of the same universe, and in the future soon, I want to release a full game based in this universe, so if you want, when this game is already released you can check all of the games of this anthology to know even\u00a0more of this world and its characters!</p>\n<p><strong>-----------JAM NOTES-----------</strong></p>\n<p>It was really fun to start this anthology that I wanted so much to start in a jam so good as this one was like a dream, I felt like it was the perfect amount of time and mood of the jam for the moment I was to start this project, and the result, I couldn't be more happy! I really loved how the game is now, I know there is a lot of things to improve, and I am more than happy to hear all the reviews everyone have to know what I can improve in the next game of the Lamphade Anthology!</p>\n<p><strong>Browser version notes:</strong> Maybe the performance on the browser version is worse than the downloadable versions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>-------------SOFTWARES USED-----------</strong></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Coding: Visual Studio (C#)\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Procreate, Photoshop</p>\n<p>Music: Garage Band for Mac (using apple loops)\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Audacity</p>\n<p>Font: Iloopfont (made by me for the game Iloopnati\u00a0)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T07:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccde09a3e1c016f42181b93c14aa7467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bruno Gat Car"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
