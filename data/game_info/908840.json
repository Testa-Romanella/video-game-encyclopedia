The goal of the demo is collect as many of the diamond shaped points as possible and survive the cubes. The two structures will spawn items every so often and the red orb will grant u a boosted attack while the green one will heal you. The cubes have 4 modes - Chasing in which the cubes will turn red and chase you around, -Evading where they turn green and avoid you, -Merging where the cubes can merge together to become bigger cubes which have more health and are faster and stronger, and Destroy - where they will target and destroy any items on the map.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3779c7872d9c9fdfd78b99d348bc69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sonaj000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
