A normal move will then be executed afterward.</li><li>You can only change the <strong>SHIFT </strong>direction can only be done on valid moves.</li><li>It is possible to Undo moves indefinably with <strong><em>E</em></strong>, but doing so mark your score, and prevent a \"Clean\" Victory.</li><li>The game tracks \"Clean\" and \"Unclean\" high scores separately.</li><li>The game can be restarted with <strong><em>R</em></strong> by pressing the buttons on screen.</li></ol>\r\nLanguages\r\n<p>The game currently has 2 languages. I will add more if possible.\r\n     </p>\n<ul><li><strong>English</strong></li><li><strong>Portuguese</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f417e17888ded493f85692c063c08b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Furtive Art"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
