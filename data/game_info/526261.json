So, here is the instller.</p>\n<p>From my Unity Play description:<br/>\"Based upon the Ruby 2D tutorial, I tried to get out of the box, pushing on an adventure direction. Searched Unity Learn and the web for things I wanted to do and tried to implement - other scenes, music, start, game over, ending, and even a secret area!. Ended up creating this ghostly dream world. I'm a graphic design/llustrator, so I could create quick makeshift assets to give it a unique feel. It's full of bugs and I couldn't implement things that didn' work with a copy and paste of the codes... And Raycast is not really my friend, the interactions don't work as they suppose... But for a first try, I'm very proud!\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fae1afd01b09922d7e6c04024efa2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["quimerico"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
