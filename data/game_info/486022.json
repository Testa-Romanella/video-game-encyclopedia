This demo contains:<br/></p>\n<p>- 1 Complete Level + Boss<br/>- 1 Tutorial Level<br/>- 2 Boss Fights<br/>- Extra concept art that you can see in game<br/></p>\n<p>Each character has their own playstyle! This will stay true for both regular and boss levels.\u00a0<br/>Some characters have a rpg like battle system, while others fight in a way that is similliar to run n' gun games</p>\n<p>Game Kids the game is also sort of a tie in with our other project: Kiko and the Game Kids \"The Animation\".\u00a0Both of these media take place in the same universe with the same characters and story, so it is not necessary for you to watch one if you want to understand the other.</p>\n<p>That being said, the web series will focus more on story/characters while the game will try to focus more on gameplay!\u00a0These are not huge changes of course, just small ones that can help you decide in wich way YOU would like to experience our universe.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback is appreciated! Don't be shy to let out your opinion, improving is always a must for us!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy Game Kids.<br/>\u00a0-Francis<br/></p><p>Discord\u00a0\u00a0Twitter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T05:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b27f1ff6344ad8fbcfdf28c403d0ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GKTeam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
