You're not controlling the character, but the level itself! Use the Frequency and Phase of the Sinus Wave to launch your penguin in the air by making him land on the wave at the right angle. Try to collect as many planets and stars that are in the air, and avoid the mutant polar bears! Consecutively land at the right angle to gain massive speed an rack up your combo-multiplier to get even more points!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8c3028729ce21ba481e7b9699d7323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GAMIE64"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
