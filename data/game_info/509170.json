I used only the Unity base assets(as place holder), I learned a lot about coding during the making of this project : delegates, learned about inheritance, polymorphism, UI and more. There are three main part in this project :\u00a0 the combat system , the inventory system, and the skill tree. \u00b01<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE COMBAT SYSTEM :<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Everything that fight<strong> </strong>possesses a \"Units\" script wich have a \"StatsHolder\" a system I made to manage stats on units, each statsholder can reset his stats to 0 or to the stats of another statsholder and add the stats of another statsholder to his. both the skill tree and the inventory have a statsholder and the player(inherant from \"Units\")'s statsholder will get the stats of both statsholder. Every units will use an attack, a targetingMode and a movementstate(I want to upgrade this for more possibilities like more attacks). Basics enemies will target the player, use the baseAttack and will use a \"GoToTargetAndAttack\" as movement(wich is more like a behaviour) every attack have a use range \u00b02. Every Units can mitigate damage, converte damage type to another.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE INVENTORY SYSTEM :\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>The inventory is made with a \"InventoryUI\" wich contains a \"Inventory\" shared with the player, you can store all kind of items in it and there are a equipment slot for each equipment type(2 ring slots), you can equipe items by dragging theme and puting theme in the right equipment slot, you can stack certain items \u00b03.To use usable items like the reforge item right click on it and hold then left click on the equipment item you want to reforge.Equipment items can be normal(0 item mod), magic(3 item mods) or rare(6 item mods)(rarity is not displayer yet on the item tooltip), The base damage of the player is 2 physical damage.The inventory is keeped through the scenes change.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>THE SKILL TREE :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The skill tree is an upgraded version of the one I made for another project, much more customizable. It possesses a StatsHolder, you can put and remove points \u00b04, each point have a list of \"ItemModifier\" that add or change stats on a StatsHolder. The points are keeped through the scenes change, you can moove te skill tree with left click and zoom with mouse wheel.</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong>\u00b0 : <br/></p>\n<p>1 : The web version's UI is buged hp are not being displayed correctly and the itemtooltip is buged.<br/></p>\n<p>2 : Sometime enemis behaviour desactivate.</p>\n<p>3 : when you stack items you will also pick the stack.</p>\n<p>4 : you can't remove point after scene change.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c00f2b8aa65e178da1fbeae7d3226b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yoan lechevalier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
