It's for the 3rd Bullet Hell Game Jam. I joined it halfway through, but I think I managed to get a pretty decent game out. I didn't use the free asset that was part of the jam, though. \u00a0It's a simple game where you try to catch butterflies while avoiding the bees and mosquitos. The walls will shrink as you get hit, and eventually you'll game over. The in-game instructions tell more info about the game. The music and code was made solely by me, while the player, butterfly, and enemy sprites were made by my sister. Hope you enjoy it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T07:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6173682d905cccba5b2bf495c7b933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keminari29"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
