{"id": 567576, "slug": "marble-fever", "name": "Marble Fever", "name_original": "Marble Fever", "description": "<p><strong>Marble Fever</strong> is a simple physics puzzle game. Tilt the board to guide the marble ball all the way to the goal. Beware of spikes, trapdoors, rotating platforms and other hazards! Be careful not to fall of the edge, too!</p>\n<p>Use your mouse to tilt the board. Mouse wheel to zoom in and out if necessary. Press Q to return to main menu.</p>\n<p>Once you've reached a level, you can start your next game from it\u00a0(use the Level Select menu). The game only tracks your time if you start from Level 1.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the options menu you can choose between two themes, wood and stone. You can also adjust mouse sensitivity and turn sounds on and off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've testplayed to the brink of frustration, but there are bound to be bugs. Please let me know if you notice something. Other feedback is also appreciated :)</p>\n<p>I'm preparing a desktop version with slightly better visuals (shadows, normal maps etc.) and possibly more levels and functionality. Be sure to check it out when it arrives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p>\n<p>Textures downloaded from https://cc0textures.com/<br/>Options menu icons by Kenney\u00a0https://kenney.nl/\u00a0(CC0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)<br/>Jingles\u00a0(Ball perished, goal reached, game won) also by Kenney (CC0 License)<br/>Other sounds by rubberduck\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/rubberduck\u00a0(CC0 License)</p>\n<p>Menu color palette by Joe @ lospec.com\u00a0https://lospec.com/palette-list/scenery-28</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T10:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11b2637a980fc503f9c620e85067ba53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yatchan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
