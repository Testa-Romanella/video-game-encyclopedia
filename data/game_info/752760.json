You have evidence that could end the war, but no one can be trusted. You'll have to fly deep into enemy territory through the Ring Gates in hopes that you can deliver this crucial package to their home planet directly.</p>\n<p>The deeper you go into the enemy's territory, one ring at a time, the more resistance you'll encounter.
