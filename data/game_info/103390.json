Explore the world and track them down, or just enjoy the scenery. Meet different forms of wildlife and discover new places.</p>\n<p><strong>What Is Clutch?</strong></p>\n<p>A quiet game of discovery and quacking. Swim through small, handcrafted areas and locate your missing ducklings.\u00a0Currently the game includes four areas:</p>\n<ul><li>Forest River</li><li>Island Beach</li><li>City Canal</li><li>Frozen Lake</li></ul>\n<p>(There are 18 ducklings to find in each area)</p>\n<p>Send me a tweet if you find something that breaks the game so I can fix it! Especially if you're on Linux/Mac since I have no good way to test there.<br/></p>\n<p>You can play the full Forest River area in the free demo, or pay at least $4 and play everything.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/6110158d004e2e1563e807c579a583e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mike Agresta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
