You will find seeds from monsters in dungeons or purchasing them from stores. You then plant and tend to the seeds that grow in vehicle parts, you can then sell those parts or use them to create vehicles that sell for a large sum of money and use that money to\u00a0buy more seeds and upgrades. The cycle is simple but fun with many systems and areas to keep players engaged.</p>\n<p>The player can also build bonds with members of the town and complete quests for them. These quests can be story related with finding the secretes of the underground to smaller fulfilment quests (growing a certain seed) to earn some money or bond points.</p>\n<p>The game offers play styles for multiple types of players, be it the highly money driven farmer who wants to make a massive farm and\u00a0make as much money or the explorer who wants to find all the secrets of the island to even the more chill player who wants to listen to relaxing music and talk to the fun characters\u00a0of the town and form relationships with them. No matter the player, they will find a play styles\u00a0for them in Bio Engineer.</p>\n\n<p>The Game is still in development and the beta will be ready soon...ish but here is a download for a very early version of the alpha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T08:10:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/892f3aea3d95d1637065318c3bd4c7b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harvey The Moist"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
