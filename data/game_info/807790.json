She, and some friends, are enrolling in the kingdom of Storia's Noble Academy - but there's a more sinister reason they have for it than one would think at first glance.</p>\n<p>Revenge.</p>\n<p>Revenge for what, you may ask yourself? Each one of them - Allyrann, Codin, Shimmer and Mason - all have their reasons for either going along with the others', or desiring their own, revenge. But the question is whether they'll get it - and if they do, will it be worth it?</p>\n<p>This preview introduces the main four characters, plus some side characters who will likely play a part in the full game. Many of the side characters will react differently depending on if you speak to them with Allyrann in her full-human or draconic form, but there's not a whole lot of story yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T12:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c16/c16e3c13910341feee34a019fefabf8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Person of Few Talents"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
