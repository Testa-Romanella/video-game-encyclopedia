{"id": 814997, "slug": "halodoom", "name": "Halodoom", "name_original": "Halodoom", "description": "Halodoom is a fangame that pays tribute to the Halo universe   and seeks to push the Doom Engine to its limits!\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile utilizing the source port Zandronum, Halodoom offers a totally unique and\u00a0standalone modern Halo\u00a0experience\u00a0within the classic engine that originally spawned the first person shooter\u00a0genre!\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHalodoom was a solo project I first started when I was 15 years old and had no idea how to go about making it happen. Initially brought about by a desire to play Halo on an iPod Mini after learning it could run Doom, the project soon snowballed into something that I would carry with me for half of my life, and would set me on a path of game development that I am still on today.\u00a0 It has seen several iterations in the past, and gone by many names, a comfort project\u00a0I could pick away at whenever I felt the urge.\u00a0Now, 15 years later, it's time to finally do justice to the first game\u00a0I ever made. It's time to finish this fight!\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\n\n<strong>16 Weapons and 4 Grenade Types and Classic Powerups</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p>Halodoom's Weapons Sandbox includes : Assault Rifle, Battle Rifle, Magnum, Sniper, Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Spiker Rifle, Mauler, Chainsaw, Plasma Pistol, Plasma Rifle, Carbine,\u00a0Needler, Fuel Rod Cannon, Energy Sword, Beam Rifle, Frag Grenades, Plasma Grenades, Spike Grenades and Firebomb Grenades. You will also occasionally find an Overshield or Active Camo!</p>\n\n\n\n\r\n8 Armor Coatings With Adjustable Primary Color\r\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n<p>Customize your Mark VI Armor set with 8 different coatings, combined with a slider system for primary color, you have a myriad of different aesthetic options!</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Flood and Covenant Firefight With 8 Hidden Unlockable Skulls</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p>Fight against waves of either Covenant (On the map Terminus) or Flood (On Flood Gulch). Firefight offers a range of difficulties from Easy to Mythic, as well as the option to Save/Load your game. Once you've found and unlocked Skull modifiers hidden within the various maps, you can enable them in this mode to yield some pretty absurd results!</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>72 Possible Game Mode Combinations!</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Halodoom offers a handful of familiar game types including Slayer, Oddball, King of the Hill, Juggernaut,\u00a0 Infection and SWAT (With more on the way in a future update)\u00a0. Coupled with 12 unique weapon start templates, you'll never run out of variations to try out! You can also play either Free for All or as a\u00a0Team!</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Interactive Main Menu Map</strong>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Halodoom contains an interactive main menu with visual aids\u00a0to better help you get started. Custom views will pop up\u00a0for map selection, player customization and bot selection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<strong>15 Custom Bots\u00a0</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Engage in combat with these highly customized bots. If you've ever played Doom with bots you'll know they can be a bit... simplistic. These bots have custom behavior which allows them to better utilize the maps and game types.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<strong>13 Multiplayer Maps</strong>\n<p>Test your skills against\u00a0bots on 13 multiplayer maps which contain classic remakes of both Halo and Doom staples, as well as a healthy dose of\u00a0original creations.
