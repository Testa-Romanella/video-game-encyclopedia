Players explore top-down levels full of monsters, hazards, secrets, and treasures. Battles are kept simple with and ebb and flow, resembling the traditional style of Dragon Quest. Your character's attributes level up the way you choose; coupled with balanced gear options, you get an equally challenging, balanced experience while playing your character your way.<br/><br/>In the Story Mode, the player selects their difficulty level, names their character (including secret avatars via codes), and begins their journey through a concise adventure across four episodes. Some levels, treasures, riddles, and monsters are shuffled in each playthrough. This adds variety while retaining the experience of learning the game and maps.<br/><br/>In Casual Mode, the score system is disabled, and the player gains the ability to save freely, including an autosave feature. This mode lets the player enjoy the game at their own pace, and practice to score higher in Competitive Mode.<br/>Competitive Mode is the more difficult primary game mode, with each monster, puzzle, treasure, and secret awarding points. With hundreds of scenarios, secrets, and bonuses, players have a virtually endless challenge awaiting them to get the highest score. Furthermore, completing the game opens Endless Dungeon +, allowing the player to play in the Endless Dungeon with their existing character, pushing their score to never-ending heights.<br/><br/>The Endless Dungeon is also selectable as a separate mode. In this mode, players begin with a full loadout of gear and journey through a never-ending, always-changing dungeon. This is the perfect mode to play when you want to get in a quick game but you're short on time!<br/><br/><strong>\u200bWhat's new about the Steam Deluxe Edition?</strong><br/><br/>Fully expanded, retooled, and remastered<br/>Practice Mode- Freely save your progress in this scoreless non-competitive mode.
