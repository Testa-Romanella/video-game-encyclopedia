{"id": 919002, "slug": "enchanterelle", "name": "Enchanterelle", "name_original": "Enchanterelle", "description": "<p>This game was produced for the Tavern Game Jam: January Edition (2023)! It is a simple idle crafting game intended to be relaxing, pleasant. There is no set plot or end point, it is purely an idle game.<br/>It is in part an antithesis to my previous work (which relied on quite a few words while this game has nearly none).<br/><br/>This game is still in development, and will be undergoing significant changes in the next week. Features to come include a wandering NPC who appears in random locations, art improvements, and bug fixes.<br/><br/>Please note: this game plays in your browser! The download button is only for documentation, otherwise just click play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T14:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd23b7cc0ac4bd428f2b7aebdf4dcc36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ichor and Honey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
