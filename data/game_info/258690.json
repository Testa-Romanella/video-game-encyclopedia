You increase your ability to earn points by collecting coins during each round, then upgrading. You can choose your upgrade path including the number of balls you start each round with, the point value of the pegs, the value of the coins that appear and more.  Earning points is how you level up all the way to level 100. As you increase in your level, the amount of coins that show up on the screen also increase.
