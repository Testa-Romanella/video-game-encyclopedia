A massive, open world full of adventure and exploration awaits you as you search for clues as to the location of your cub.<br/><br/>When you initially awake and find your cub missing, the race begins. Travel throughout the land; searching amidst the sun bleached rocks, extensive ravines, luscious forests, find hidden caves  and explore long forgotten shipwrecks whilst looking for your stolen cub.  However, keep a careful eye on your stamina, health and hunger levels because if either one of them drops too low - you will die!  As you progress through the game levels you will be able to scavenge for scraps to build a camp to rest; food to eat and water to drink which will increase your levels and enable you to keep going for longer.  You will encounter peasants who may help you, and poachers who may not.  And remember - avoid the randomly occurring sand storms which can seriously limit your vision.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to conquer the sub missions as you head towards the end goal of reuniting with your missing cub?  Get, Became the Hunted, now and see if you have what it takes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aef912ab4e28f2d0d60d6072f0431a66.jpg", "website": "https://www.fourthpixel.co.uk/became-the-hunted", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FourthPixel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FourthPixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
