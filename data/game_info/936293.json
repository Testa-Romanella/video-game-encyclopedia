Despite the limited time, we are very proud of our creation and had a lot of fun making it, despite the unexpected challenges.\r\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay of Nokuest is inspired by rogue-lite games like Hades or Dead Cells, where each playthrough is a challenge to overcome, as death means starting over from the Hub.</p>\r\nMAPPING :\r\n<p><strong>Move </strong>: left-right arrow keys\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jump :</strong> Space\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Interact / Pass dialogue :</strong> E\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Attack : </strong>Mouse click\u00a0</p>\r\nWHAT'S THE GOAL ?\r\n<p>In Nokuest, you play as a brave knight sent by the crown to defeat a beast that has been terrorizing the kingdom for a long time. This creature resides in an imposing castle, and you must enter it to fight and save the realm.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a world where levels are randomly generated, meaning that each playthrough will be different. You will have to explore the different levels of the castle, fight the enemies that are there, and collect coins that will allow you to buy upgrades from the merchant's shop located in the Hub.\r\n</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, you will meet a merchant who will be on your way. This merchant, impressed by your courage and determination, sees potential in you and decides to help you.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you are the only knight to have gone so far into the castle in months, the merchant will help you by teleporting you directly to him at the beginning of the level when you are about to die during a run. This will allow you to recover your health and buy upgrades from him to increase your chances of survival.\r\n</p>\n<p>The merchant will have an inventory filled with useful items to enhance your skills. However, it will cost you a lot of coins to buy these items, so make sure to collect as much gold as possible throughout your quest.</p>\r\nDEVS' NOTE :\r\n<p>Although we did not have time to add the final battle against the beast in the castle, nor the shop, but we work on to integrate them in the game soon as possible !\u00a0We hope you enjoy playing Nokuest.</p>\r\nFUN FACT :\r\n\r\n<p>Nokuest gets its name from the combination of Nokia and Quest, in homage to the Nokia Game Jam 2023. However, during the development of the game, we unfortunately did not have time to include the final quest.</p>\n<p>Thus, \"No Quest\" took on a double meaning for our game : not only were we unable to include the final quest, but the name itself also reflects this lack.</p>\r\nTEAM MEMBERS :\r\n<p>Game Designer / Artist 2D : Moe<br/>Sound Designer : wild_doctor<br/></p>\r\nSPECIAL THANKS TO :\u00a0\r\n<p>Back Dev \u00a0: Hubert Grossin &amp; Nanoni17728<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T21:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3ef563740425641247654e7713639d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Moe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
