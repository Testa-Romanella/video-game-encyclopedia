If you are uncomfortable with such subject matter, please avoid this game. <br/>If anybody finds issue with my portrayal of the themes in this game, I am more than happy to incorporate your feedback. Please leave a comment, or email me at ben.ja.wells@gmail.com, and I will do whatever I can to see your concerns are met. <br/><br/><br/>THE GAME: <br/>Esc is a puzzle platform game designed with the intention of increasing awareness of domestic violence. You play as a married woman, exploring a cave with her husband, during the \"honeymoon\" phase of the cycle of abuse. <br/><br/>I interpreted the theme \"Beneath the Surface\" as being about domestic abuse. The pain of an abusive relationship is highly physical, yet the greatest of pains is the psychological damage inflicted by being repeatedly hurt by the one you love so much, having your self esteem torn down again and again. Abusive relationships can be very difficult to spot for outsiders, seeming normal on the surface, yet beneath is an entire world of horrors, horrors which nobody deserves to have inflicted upon themselves. <br/><br/>CONTROLS: <br/>Controls are told in-game, but WASD or arrow keys move. <br/>Up makes your character jump. <br/>Down will make you tell your partner to stay where he is. Stand near him and press Down again to make him resume following you. <br/>The R letter restarts the current level. <br/><br/>KNOWN ISSUES: <br/>There are some issues regarding moving the character becoming stuck inside platforms. <br/>Rocks sometimes struggle to fall down rock sized holes. <br/><br/>I would like to give a special word of thanks to those friends of mine who helped educate me on the subject of domestic abuse, allowing me to attempt to promote awareness of this terrible phenomenon. <br/><br/>FURTHER MATERIAL <br/>If you feel like you are in an abusive relationship, or know somebody who is, there exist many resources online which you may consult for guidance. <br/>http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm <br/>http://www.mensadviceline.org.uk/mens_advice.php.html <br/>http://thisisabuse.direct.gov.uk/ <br/><br/>Thank you for your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7feddc0bb4b50274f7ffb1130183844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crumpet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
