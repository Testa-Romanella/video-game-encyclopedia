No weapons, no special powers, no augments; just pure skill. Contenders build up their reputations in other arenas to get a chance to be invited into this prestigious arena. Only the very best compete. The grand prize? You not only get to keep your robot but they say when you win you\u2019re set for life. Andromeda Ball isn\u2019t without its drawbacks, however. If you lose you\u2019ll never be able to compete again.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a bit buggy right now as we only had 48 hours but we hope to improve this game in the future when we get more time, so lookout for an update!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e5f6db315a55559bd335ab4a5a9be83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan.Raia", "2sad4war", "MattMcL1221", "Gerald_M"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
