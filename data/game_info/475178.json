It is such an abstract concept, really hard to grasp and full of uncertainty for me. After the Covid-19 has reshaped our lives, I've started to feel both scared and stuck in a place I didn't choose to be. The persisting uncertainty in our current lives made me revisit the tragic story of the acclaimed writer Stefan Zweig and his wife Lotte. And I end up creating this tiny narrative about infinity almost as a healing act. I hope it speaks to you in some way.</p><p>Music and sfx: Ay\u015feg\u00fcl Kuntman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T02:59:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64002cdc930cd6d9c25f6678441df83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Edanur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
