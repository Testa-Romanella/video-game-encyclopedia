This project is a labour of love I wish to share with my communities as well as those less familiar with Jewish history and customs, so I hope even those who don't celebrate Chanukah will learn something new and enjoy it regardless!\u00a0<br/><br/>Thank you for stopping by and warm holiday wishes to everyone!\u00a0&lt;3 \u304f\u30b3:\u5f61\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/187/187256d482056e6e5367974615ca7164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joiedeveve"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
