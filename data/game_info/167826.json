The towers have a natural tendency to recede, and crumble when they've reached their apex, so that the surface of nodes is an ever-changing structure with sounds that evolve along with the player experience.<br/><br/>There's no real challenge or objective - but me and my 2 buds hope you'll appreciate it.<br/>Don't hesitate to leave feedback in the comments, we would love to hear it !<br/>Also follow our Twitter, @TeamGradus ! That way we can swear to love you forever and we'll tell you what we're up regularly.</p>\n<p>GRADUS Team is comprised Antoine Gilles (@Sikuall), Jeremie Tordjman (@Rageremie), and Fabien Calendrier (@Fabayou).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f84d521f1e04430d8ab162719f0098f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Belldrop"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
