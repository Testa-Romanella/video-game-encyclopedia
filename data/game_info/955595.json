VR. MULTIPLAYER.</h3>In a first for VR, players are no longer ghostly beings that can phase through each other. In NervBox, not only is your physical body simulated in-game but so are other players. Push each other around, work together, or fight to the death, there are no limits.<h3>Immersive Interactions</h3>NervBox features an accurate interaction system and various mechanics to make combat feel good.  Rack a shotgun with one hand, toss a knife in the air, force-grab it back, climb over a friend or give a crisp high five.<h3>Active Ragdolls</h3>Your friends aren't the only living entities in-game. NervBox features fully physics-driven NPCs that will attack you and your friends. Use guns, swords, or just your fists and fight back.<h3>Multiple Gamemodes</h3>Fight and defend your base in \u201cTower Defense\u201d, sharpen your combat skills in the close quarters \u201cKill House\u201d, or let your imagination run wild in the sandbox mode; NervBox contains various levels designed to let you and your friends experience something new every time you play.<h3>Play Comfortably</h3>NervBox's physics-driven player controller has been built with seated play in mind since day one. Gone are the days of having to choose between a VR gaming session or a relaxing one.<h3>Next Level Audio</h3>NervBox features fully spatialized audio for everything, so you will be entirely immersed not just visually or physically.  Big empty rooms will have reverb, large structures will block sounds entirely, and even voice communications are spatialized.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T05:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef9c86cd61d6d61cf64cc9f64da88b5.jpg", "website": "https://nervbox.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quantum Lion Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Quantum Lion Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
