This is done with a robomower. However, it's old and broken and Father Jobe Merrin needs to use his rake to rotate it if needed. He can also teleport it back to the start using his Bible. If the mower rolls over a poop from the family's dog, it loses speed. Jobe's workday ends when the robomower reaches its charger. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50a5ac50b589272eeab036417e8d883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boymakesnoise"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
