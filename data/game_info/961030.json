{"id": 961030, "slug": "farkle-online-pvp-board-game", "name": "Farkle Online: PVP Board Game", "name_original": "Farkle Online: PVP Board Game", "description": "Farkle is a popular dice game that is easy to learn and offers hours of fun. The game can be played by two or more players, and the objective is to be the first player to reach a predetermined point total, typically 10,000 points. Farkle is a game of luck, but it also involves strategy and decision making.<br/><br/>The game is played with six dice, and each player takes turns rolling the dice. After each roll, the player sets aside any dice that score points and chooses whether to continue rolling the remaining dice or to end their turn and keep their points. If a player sets aside all six dice in one turn, they can continue to roll all six dice again, earning bonus points for doing so.<br/><br/>The scoring in Farkle Online is based on certain combinations of dice. For example, rolling a one or a five earns points, as does rolling three or more of a kind. Other combinations, such as a straight or three pairs, also earn points. However, if a player rolls the dice and none of them score points, they \"farkle\" and lose all the points they earned during that turn.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players must decide when to take risks and continue rolling, and when to play it safe and end their turn. They must also be mindful of their opponents' scores and adjust their strategy accordingly. The game can be played with different variations and house rules, such as allowing players to roll certain combinations again or requiring a minimum score to begin earning points.<br/><br/>Farkle Online is a great game for all ages and skill levels. It can be played with just a set of dice and a pen and paper to keep score. It's also available in digital versions, such as smartphone apps and online games, for those who prefer a more modern approach. Whether you're playing for fun or for serious competition, Farkle is sure to provide hours of entertainment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T05:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/966/9668b45359c5fe22fd08962cd53b4fba_wBM1lb6.jpg", "website": "https://zonk.smapps.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Smart Project"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Smart Project"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
