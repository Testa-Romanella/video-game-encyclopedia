Have you ever wondered who would win, King Arthur (aided by Merlin) or a sword-wielding Alice of Wonderland? How would Sinbad and his trusty porter fare against Medusa and the three harpies? The only way to find the truth is in battle with a quick game of Unmatched!<br/><br/><h3>What is Unmatched?</h3><strong>Unmatched: Digital Edition is a tactical game</strong> where each player commands their hero and sidekick(s), using a unique deck of cards, to defeat their opponent on the field of battle.<br/><br/><strong>The rules are simple. On your turn, take two actions which can be:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Maneuver: Move your fighters and draw a card!<br/></li><li> Attack: Play an attack card!<br/></li><li> Scheme: Play a scheme card (cards that have a special effect).</li></ul>Get your opponent's hero to zero health, and you win the game.<br/><br/>What makes the game special is that each hero has a unique deck and ability. Alice grows big and gets small. King Arthur can discard a card to power up his attack. Sinbad gets stronger as he goes on more voyages. Medusa can damage you with just a glance.<br/><br/><h3>What makes Unmatched great?</h3>Unmatched is one of those easy-to-learn games with an incredible amount of depth. The tactical insight and knowledge of your hero and your opponent's will determine the outcome of the fight. Games are quick \u2013 but play out very differently! Your decisions will determine your fate, and your skill (and just a bit of luck) will win the day.<br/><br/><h3>What can you expect?</h3><ul><li>\u2694\ufe0f Epic duels between the most unlikely opponents!<br/></li><li>\u265f\ufe0f Huge tactical depth!<br/></li><li>\ud83c\udfa8 Stunning artwork by legendary artists!<br/></li><li>\ud83e\uddbeThree levels of AI for solo play!<br/></li><li>\u267e\ufe0f Near infinite replayability!<br/></li><li>\ud83e\udde0 Easy to learn, hard to master!<br/></li><li>\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf93 In-game tutorial and rulebook!<br/></li><li>\ud83c\udf10 Online multiplayer!<br/></li><li>\u231b Synchronous and asynchronous game modes!<br/></li><li>\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f Official Unmatched rules consulted with the designers of the board game!<br/></li><li>\ud83d\udd1c Multiple expansions to come - bringing new heroes and maps!<br/></li><li>\ud83d\udcbb Unique experience of a board game with the convenience of a digital platform!</li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677980/Unmatched_Digital_Edition/<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T09:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74e/74e01da502b507131502ca556ef151b9.jpg", "website": "https://unmatched.acram.eu/?utm_source=steam&amp;utm_medium=steam_page&amp;utm_campaign=store_page&amp;utm_content=link", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Acram Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Board Games", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Acram Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
