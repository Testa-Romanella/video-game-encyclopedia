Over a trillion years since The Sphere's star, Methuselah, went out and now wanders cold and empty space. The droids on board sleep, waiting for their batteries to finally drain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One droid, Trax, and The Sphere's AI, Shepherd, wake to a miracle. A new star! A potential source of energy for trillions of years to come. But during their long sleep The Sphere has become infested by energy sapping parasites. No knowing\u00a0where they came from. All they know is that if they want to survive, they must defeat the beasts to reintegrate The Sphere around The Last Star.</p>\n<p>The Last Star is a top down shooter in a time when energy is scarce and finite. The battery that powers your weapons also powers your light, and you! The energy it takes to kill an enemy can be recovered from the energy orbs they drop on death. The only way energy is lost forever is if you miss your shots. Some enemies, such as the hideous Spawners, and bullet flinging Pupae, drop extra energy. But the beasts want that energy too, and if the Larvae absorb enough, they will evolve into Pupae.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nChapters\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chapter 1<br/></strong>Introduction to the story and basic mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 2<br/></strong>The fight to save The Sphere begins!
