Within its halls, the air was filled with a sense of serenity and camaraderie. Castle Yurei was led by Queen Seraph and her daughter, Princess Tennyo, a wise and compassionate set of angels who embodied strength and grace. In this realm, same-sex love was the only celebrated and embraced love.<br/><br/>However, not far from Castle Yurei, atop a forbidding mountain, loomed the imposing Kingdom Jomon.
