I'd like to note that the word list used in this game comes from worksheets from my Chinese teacher Heidy and I am by no means an expert, please take the information presented with a grain of salt knowing that I am not a native speaker.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ce/6ceda0d1d4cb5a511bec6fffd32cbfe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jrap"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
