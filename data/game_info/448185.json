All you have to do is count! But of course life won't make it easy for you. Still... how hard can that be? ;^)</p>\n<p>In all honesty though this is a very stressful game and I had a great time just trying to test all the little game mechanics I put into this.</p>\n<p>The voice-acting, artwork, music and programming was all done by me except for some voicelines and soundeffects. If you enjoy playing this game or have some criticism I'd love to hear it. This is my first game after all and I have spent quite some time building it even if it's far from perfect.</p>\n<p>Hint: Reach 144.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd897135afa9aa39fae7f17ec60232d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Potatoverse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
