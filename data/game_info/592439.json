It was made over the course of a week as an entry for the\u00a0Spring lisp game jam 2021.</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at making a game in Clojure and mostly wanted to get something with a simple gimmick working end to end. The game features:</p>\n<ul><li>Light on/off mechanic - Player can only move in the dark whereas in the light the maze is viewable but the player is stuck and enemies will target them.\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Randomly populated maps - goal , coin and wall placements are seeded per level and play through.</li><li>Indicators\u00a0to show when a player has a hit a wall or picked up the coin in the dark.</li><li>3 levels with increasing difficulty</li></ul>\n<p>source can be found on my github repo\u00a0here\u00a0.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Arrow keys to move and space turns lights on/off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/175b92f1f534a9a550073b583d050610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Almerc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
