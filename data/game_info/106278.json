Join her on her quest to find the heroes of other worlds, build their strength, and finally figure out just what in the heck she came here for anyway.</p><p>This project was initially just my way of building my skills in <em>RPG Maker MV, </em>but before I knew it, it started to actually look like a game worth playing. So, I decided it would be an injustice not to finish it.</p><p>Due to the limits of the engine, please forgive the crummy mobile controls, as well as the fact that it may sometimes run slowly on some devices. I'd fix it if I could.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f457b03df7d89001ac9dd72014d0a18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil N.
