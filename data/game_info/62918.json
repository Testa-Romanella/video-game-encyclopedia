Football Drama was started after discovering and exploring the richness and quality of the literature about football. Novelists and poets like Pasolini, Galeano, Soriano, Hornby, Saba, Handke, Wenders have written about football and its evocative and poetic power. Same in movies, with fringe and beautiful works like The Lost World Cup or Wender&#39;s The Goalie&#39;s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick. Another great inspiration was the book Football Clich\u00e9s by Adam Hurrey. This naturally lead to the question: why people love football so much? So we started designing a new, unique game around football, as we believe games can be a wonderful media for storytelling.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T04:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/480/4806f225c95d4d678c50277b8234276b.jpg", "website": "https://www.open-lab.com/footballdrama/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 17, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Open Lab", "Open Lab Games & Demigiant"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Open Lab Games", "Open Lab"], "esrb_rating": null}
