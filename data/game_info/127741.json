Each round you will have to pick 3 options to transmit to the rocket\u00a0either dodge left/right, defend, or attack the opponent. Each option will be played in order of your selection, and options will be prioritized based on their ability. Movement will always go first while defend will go second and attack goes last (priority wise for that action). The next 2 actions will play out accordingly. If you line up your attack and hit opponent, you will gain 1 point and move to the next rocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are a rocket technician thrown into the pilot's seat at your command center in a secret government organization and you have to manually control the rocket through your enemies counter rockets. The commands are simple: You have an big red attack button, You have a Defense Shield button, and a Joystick to dodge out of the way of the rockets!</p>\n<p>Don't get hit and take down the enemy! Will you survive?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/674094b1bd814a26d0c33ec410353270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GameDirection", "DF2S"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
