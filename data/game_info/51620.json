Your team's goal is to eliminate the enemy commanders off the face of the island.  <br/><br/>First, seek out and battle neutral monsters in order to gather basic minions. Then, gain control of transform points around the map where you can mutate your basic minions into larger and more powerful ones, each with their own special ability.  Choose the perfect combination of minions and their abilities to trap, blast, or melt all the enemy team's commanders and win the round.  Finally, rinse their tears off your good mouse hand, and repeat the process once more.Feature Overview<ul><li> Battle in 3v3 multiplayer arenas <br/></li><li> Unlock commanders &amp; factions<br/></li><li> Fire rockets out of tortoises' shells<br/></li><li> Top the leaderboards<br/></li><li> Electrocute somebody with tesla coil unicycles<br/></li><li> Tame the powerful Dreadbeast</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e40c8af3e3e7a23ee22a9ecbe6fd3f.jpg", "website": "http://maestrosgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Systence Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Systence Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
