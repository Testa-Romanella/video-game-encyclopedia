With only two strings attached.</p>\n<p>Although disbelieved at first, Gen. Corp proved their claims and were granted their concessions by the world governments:</p>\n<p>First, the funding to create their endless supply of power, the Infinity Generators.</p>\n<p>And secondly, land and complete sovereignty.</p>\n<p>And so Generation City was formed next to the four gigantic Infinity Generators that fed the energy needs of the world for years.</p>\n<p>Still afraid of another budding energy crisis, and given breathing room, countries frantically developed other forms of energy; thermal, advanced solar, large hydroelectric plants, and other forms advanced and soon were enough by themselves.</p>\n<p>Their timing was perfect as the next year a huge and impenetrable domed barrier formed around the generators, cutting the power flow out to miniscule levels.</p>\n<p>Without the interest of the world at stake, Generation City fell into a lull, and it's only other product, freedom from world laws, became it's primarly sales point.</p>\n<p>For several years, Generation City became a place of crime and crusades, black markets and money lenders flocked and many transactions were performed within the city. Things were going poorly, and as history had shown, downward trends had a nasty habit of continuing.</p>\n<p>The shield that had blocked access to the Infinity Generators had been leaking a strange radiation, one which began to affect the citizen. Nearly unnoticable at first, things began to speed up, and soon citizens found themselves changed.</p>\n<p>The changes were not always disfiguring, and they were usually not even negative. People soon found themselves possessing increased physical attributes, and some found themselves able to control the elements or use powers not unlike those of comic-book superheroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Sahra Vintage</strong></strong></p>\n<p>The protagonist of this story, more or less, Sahra's history is less shady than it might seem, although her future more murky.</p>\n<p><strong>Mistress Mystic</strong></p>\n<p>Her memory erased after an escape from Gen Corp, Mystic seems to be more the protagonist than Sahra, although it always seems to be Sahra that bears the brunt of the troubles caused.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Customized RTAB system!<br/>A.
