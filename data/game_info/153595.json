A quirky physics based puzzler, in which your goal is to make it to the end of each level, while avoiding obstacles. Sounds simple at first, but Charles does not have a limitless source of energy, as he gives up a little bit of his own mass and size every time he propels himself forward. So making it to the end of a level without out running out of thrust becomes quite tricky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb712fdc49ff669576087babca8d0e33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GoingMadGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
