After doing so, the portal to the next level will spawn. You have shields and health, although, you should tread lightly, as there is no way to regenerate health once the level has started! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:34:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f72c6f005dee5656caf761e7565bcbc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aschafer777"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
