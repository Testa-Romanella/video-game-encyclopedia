Get to the end, pick up optional tapes, fun times for all.</p>\n<p>Controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Z - Run (have to unlock it first)</li><li>X - Jump</li><li>C - Grab a flipped enemy</li><li>Space - Chat to your fly friend. You can't leave the room til he's shut up, but you can walk around.</li></ul>\n<p>It's also controller friendly! I tested it with a Switch Pro controller though, so I don't know how well it's going to work on your end.</p>\n<p>Debug stuff:</p>\n<p>Press T to restart a room.</p>\n<p>Press Q and W to change your colour palette - you don't even need to have it unlocked! Or you can hold Backspace to walk through em slowlike.</p>\n<p>Press 0 to bring up the map. No marker to say where you are on it though, so good luck with that.</p>\n<p>Press L to unlock extra abilities not normally obtainable in the demo. Walljump is self explanatory, and Tongue can be used with the V key. Climb up one way platforms and grab enemies!</p>\n<p>That's it I think. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a6b3a3a2537954c56117c359816ce77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cactuar18"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
