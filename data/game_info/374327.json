We made this game as the final project of a game design course. It is a local multiplayer game and really fun especially when playing with\u00a0your friend. Once you are bounced outside the screen, you will respawn randomly from above but with a cost of all your scores! So be careful till the last second of the game!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this game do not have a H5 version(I only brought the desktop version of GameMaker..), so I only uploaded the macOS build(windows build will be available later).\u00a0But definitely check it out and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Oh, and I almost forgot, don't forget to check out the jukebox in the game!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9d8892dc63c277d7fc17000bb38f320.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hujy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
