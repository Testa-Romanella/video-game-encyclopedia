To play it you can either download the GB ROM, or\u00a0play it right here in the browser!</p>\n<p>It was made using\u00a0GBDK 2020, a framework for writing GameBoy games in C.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The goal of\u00a0<strong>WORD BLOCKS\u00a0</strong>is to rotate and place letter blocks in such a way that they form <em>3-6 letter words</em>. Forming longer words (at later levels)\u00a0awards more points than shorter words, but of course they are more difficult to form as well. The game ends when you are forced to place a letter block in the first row of the game grid.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<strong>GB</strong><strong>Browser</strong><strong>Function</strong>\ud83e\udc81\ud83e\udc7b\ud83e\udc80\ud83e\udc82\ud83e\udc81\ud83e\udc7b\ud83e\udc80\ud83e\udc82Navigate the menuAWSelect menu options\ud83e\udc80\ud83e\udc82\ud83e\udc80\ud83e\udc82Move the block\ud83e\udc81\ud83e\udc81Hard drop the current block\ud83e\udc7b\ud83e\udc7bSoft drop the current blockAWRotate the current block clockwiseBERotate the current block counter-clockwiseStartEnterNavigate game over menu &amp;\u00a0pause the gameSelectShiftConcede a round of the game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2dbbbd2e6847f1bb583cecfbbc197274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jakob"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
