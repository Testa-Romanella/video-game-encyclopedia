{"id": 709351, "slug": "inabsolutus", "name": "Inabsolutus", "name_original": "Inabsolutus", "description": "<p>Inabsolutus is a curated webXR gallery showcasing a collection of abandoned art projects with the aim of reviving past ideas and transforming them into new experiences, shared for all to enjoy. The purpose of the pursuit of this topic is to recognize that these projects, although unfinished, represent a part of the developing brainscape of each artist and are an integral part to each of our developmental processes. The experience is unique in its way that it gives autonomy to the user to explore the space at their own pace, interacting and engaging with incomplete pieces that are synthesized into a world left behind. For the first iteration of this developing project, the gallery will showcase my own work within 3D development, and will eventually branch out into external featured creators. The user will explore this limbo world in the first person, using game controllers to pan and interact with their surroundings. This experimental format will allow each individual participant to imbues their own interpretation into its contents and to catch a glimpse into the forgotten thoughts of creative endeavors, in conjunction with inspiring its creators with new perspectives to contribute and finish these artworks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0d05a3489c981d8fe454770ea92520.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Michelle.L."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
