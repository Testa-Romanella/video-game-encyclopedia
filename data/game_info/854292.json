Unfortunately, by mishandling, he sees himself teleported to a world he does not know and he cannot return to where he came from because the artifact has broken. He therefore finds himself in a world made up of flying islands in which time passes at high speed. This world reflects our society. As their journey progresses, the child will see the \u201cnatural\u201d world around them transform into a robotic, artificial world. His goal is to progress in this world and therefore travel through it to repair the artifact through the progressive technology of the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dabc2c3c3cebf947e99c285fa5b1bef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MKelian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
