Select a unit and plan their next 3 moves. You may set up to 3 plans per round. Careful, other players will also be creating plans at the same time and may override yours. After a minute, all plans will be executed and whichever team has more units left at the end wins the round! The round will then be reset after another minute.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours by Brandon Vickrey for the GMTK2020 game jam. All of the art (except the music and sound icons) was made during the jam as well.</p>\n<p>Socials:</p>\n<p>Twitch -\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/vykri</p>\n<p>Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiqbtxcsijI68Dyc8uFmyA</p><p>Website -\u00a0https://vykri.com/</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music and sound icons - Kenney\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets</p>\n<p>Sound effects and music -\u00a0PMSFX\u00a0https://www.pmsfx.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:19:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328a601a0cd445ef011e87f391eac1f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vykri"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
