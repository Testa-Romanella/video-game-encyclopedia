I wrote this one as I (foolishly) thought it would be easy, but was curious on how to get the missile trail. Too simple for particles, I ended up using the canvas graphics class. Different from the other controls at the time, Missile Command was played with the trackball. The nearest we now have is the mouse or trackpad, so mouse to move the target and either A,S &amp; D to fire from the appropriate base, or left mouse to fire from the nearest base (with missiles). Again, I've tried to keep it faithful to the original, so enjoy (sound on please).</strong><br/><strong>(ps - there may be a text issue in Brave - Chrome &amp; Firefox are good though)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad4/ad49be162546edc25e330e80da48a000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GaryD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
