I still get a kick out of it even though it's kind of short, so I thought I'd make it more easily accessible to the public. There are fun references to other science-fiction creations sprinkled throughout, but the story is new.\u00a0There are many ways to lose, and only one way to win. A fully-played game takes about twenty minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/584d8b2d49c4cebd07d5b53768d3ecef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["energeticjen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
