{"id": 488233, "slug": "jeoparody", "name": "JeoParody", "name_original": "JeoParody", "description": "<p>Current Release - 0.1 (Functionally Complete)</p>\n<p>Do you love game shows, but hate that its filled with a bunch of normie questions, instead questions about Stargate Atlantis (or whatever nerds are into these days)? Want to create your own style of \"Jeopardy\" game show for you friends, but don't want to use visually boring Jeopardy-style games in powerpoint? The search for a good Jeopardy player is over with JeoParody!</p>\n<p>JeoParody is a simple-to-use game show player, that is easy to edit. It's as simple as editing .txt files. The process of running a session is as smooth as any TV gameshow would make it out to be, with a simple mouse + two keyboard button control scheme. Additionally, there are debug options to fix any errors made during a session.<br/><br/>0.1 Release - This is a functionally complete release, and has everything necessary to run a session. There is room for massive UX polish, tutorialization, and polished visual effects. Additionally, there is no buzzer feature yet, as my current personal use involved\u00a0 the use of an online buzzer alongside the program\u00a0 (I recommend buzzin.live). A sample playable session is included.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/0770f83c28ffb0f6dde591cd77d5b7df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cowfish13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
