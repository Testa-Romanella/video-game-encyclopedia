The goal is to solve all the puzzles in the game to reach the end of the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game is in progress and currently in <strong>PROOF OF CONCEPT </strong>phase. This means that nothing is set in stone yet. I am working hard on this project, and I have set goals and milestones for myself. You can few my schedule further down below.\u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>The game takes its inspiration from the classical Rubik's Cube. You are a first-person character that is standing in a world where you can rotate giant blocks of environment. With this feature, you have to solve puzzles in order to progress.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The player is able to rotate blocks that are parallel to the player and where a blue control pad is located. In the image below you can see that the player is able to rotate this block. The player can rotate the block both ways (left and right), as long as the previous two statements are true.</p>\n\n<p><em>The player is able to rotate this block left or right.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>When there is a block parallel to the player and the blue control pad, then the player is able to rotate the block. However, the player cannot rotate the block perpendicular to his/her position.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Here the player is unable to rotate the block perpendicular to the player</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Whenever there are blocks adjacent to\u00a0the block that is being rotated, then those blocks will follow. However, the previous statements still need to be true. So, as long as there is a blue control pad and a block, then the player is able to rotate it, parallel to the player's position.</p>\n\n<p><em>The blocks\u00a0adjacent to the one that is being rotated, will follow</em></p>\n<br/>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>\r\nThis roadmap shows the overall planning of the project. Every 3 weeks I have a deadline with a couple of tasks that I aim to have completed. I will update this roadmap regularly and I will talk about my accomplishments and setbacks during the Devlogs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Click on the image above to view it in full screen.</p>\n\n\r\nDevlogs\r\n<p>I will be posting a new devlog on the Friday where I have to set a deadline for myself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355899ad6cc3145164d445688f175197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dennis Verschuur"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
