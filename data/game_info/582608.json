Diary entries will include categories such as childhood, horror, dreams, high school, romantic, never told a soul, text/online, naughty, mystery, travel and daydream stories.\r\n</p>\n<p>In each Diary entry, you have to option of two endings. You will either get a \"Naked Truth Ending\" or a \"Your Experience Ending.\" You can play twice to get both endings. Some entries have multiple Your Experience Endings, but remember, every Diary entry has a Naked Truth ending since every story is based on a true story/diary entry. Let's see if you make the same decisions as to the writer or if you will claim the truth and make it your experience.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Diaries hold the deep dark truth about a person's traumatic, or just personal daily embarrassing or beautiful experiences, however, diaries are usually kept secret.

When people tell True stories, they sometimes have no follow-up or continuation, and they end just like that. However, I've created the Daydream Diary, which is a category where I can daydream about your True stories and make spin-offs bases off of your entry, and from there, a series is born.
