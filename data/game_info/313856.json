Specifically, those with interests in military weapons grade robotics. According to our intel, Welkin Robotics has developed new advancements in robotics and weapons tech that has allowed Welkin Robotics to amass a private army that is currently under development in their low orbital research facility. Upon infiltration, we have lost contact with CANE Operative 0813. We have just received a livestream from within the Welkin Robotics research facility. 0813 has been placed in an arena filled with experimental robotic weapons systems. The transmission also included a statement from Welkin Robotics officials stating any rescue attempt will result in the immediate termination of 0813. We have been informed that 0813 will be released upon successful completion of the trial.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2026End Transmission<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2026Initiate Research Arena Protocol ://Legion.exe<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Face 100 waves of The Legion<br/>\r\n*Useful powerups<br/>\r\n*Compete for high scores<br/>\r\n*Retro soundtrack", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d262146fb708fdd59c5e9b6b35e30eb4.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/PhoenixResurrectionGames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phoenix Resurrection Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Phoenix Resurrection Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
