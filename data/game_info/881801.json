Includes fancy mechanics such as coyote timing and input buffers for jumps (they are exaggerated in this game for demonstration, try them out)</p>\n<p>This demo also has an experimental camera for platformers that attempts to look ahead for better visibility and only moves vertically when landing. It can be switched on with Q, since it's quite jumpy and disorienting. It was made with Camera 2D functions and data only, independent from the player node.\u00a0I tried to isolate it in a single node that can be attached to anything without any configuration needed.</p>\n<p>I used the same assets from my previous game \"Lone Recorder\"</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/D or Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>W or Space: Jump</p>\n<p>Q: Switch Cameras (experimental is off by default)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T13:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb3/bb3a03dc2a1ecb1ef9ba7142cfdded78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Carpyn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
