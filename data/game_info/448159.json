Rather than covering the music directly, I used similar methods to generate the noises and then used those\u00a0same methods to create the game space that the game takes place in. When tones are made, lines are created across the space for the player to avoid.</p>\n<p>I first learnt about how this music was generated whilst looking at this fantastic website by Tero Parviainen. The site explains some different ways generative music is created. I then looked deeper into Brian Eno's album from and article on Reverb Machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From these sources got the tones used and the relative size of the tape loops, or the wheels in my game from this information. As there were seven tones used, I tried to keep the theme of seven going through the game. In addition the loops and circles in some ways represent both a vinyl record spin on a player, and the loops of tapes.</p>\n<p>To create the tones I used\u00a0http://onlinetonegenerator.com/\u00a0in combination with information from\u00a0https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html</p>\n<p>The font used is Montserrat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f47da01d74affe36fa7931da822aef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["David King Made Some Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
