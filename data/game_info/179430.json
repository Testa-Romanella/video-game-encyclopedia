Or is it canni-ball-ism?) and make it perform menial exercises for your amusement.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Feeding!</strong> Feed your sphere other spheres and watch it change colour like some sort of round flamingo!</li><li><strong>Petting!</strong> Poke and rub your sphere to manipulate its tiny feelings!</li><li><strong>Jumping!\u00a0</strong>Jump into the sky! Channel the power of red to jump even higher!</li><li><strong>Rolling!</strong> Roll around at the speed of spheres! Become green to go faster! (I couldn't use blue for legal reasons.)</li><li>Eleven distinct expressions!</li><li>Progress saving!</li></ul>\n<p>Sphere Pet was made in Unity 2017.3. I\u00a0worked on it alone, with only the many iterations of spherical pets to keep me company.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bd73666396c03554fc7536d20ba824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Euophrys"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
