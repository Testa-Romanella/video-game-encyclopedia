The cities begin by using the same amount of water as the flow of their rivers bring in. If a fire starts, you must increase the flow of water in that city's river so that the water level is above the fire level in order for the fire to be extinguished. If the fire is not put out, the city will burn! Leave the water levels too high and the city will drown! Not enough water and the city will be left droughted! Sometimes the rivers get damaged too, so they need to be repaired before supplying water to the city!</p>\n<p><strong>Key controls for cities</strong></p>\n<ul><li>NorthWestVille<ul><li>&lt;Decrease river flow: Q</li><li>Repair river: W</li><li>Increase river flow: E</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>WestVille<ul><li>Decrease river flow: A</li><li>Repair river: S</li><li>Increase river flow: D</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>SouthVille<ul><li>Decrease river flow: F</li><li>Repair river: G</li><li>Increase river flow: H</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>EastVille<ul><li>Decrease river flow: J</li><li>Repair river: K</li><li>Increase river flow: L</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>NorthEastVille<ul><li>Decrease river flow: I</li><li>Repair river: O</li><li>Increase river flow: P</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:53:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e70/e70aa5f2069415e6c6fb2b96ff1df6ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["albionbrown"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
