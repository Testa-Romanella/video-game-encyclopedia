No Bitsy \"hacks\" were used.<br/></p>\n<p>Mostly structured by a custom tool written for the project, but also partially painstakingly copied and pasted. It was one hell of a job, believe me.<br/></p>\n<strong>Story time!<br/></strong>\n<p>When I was a bit younger I used to \"sit on an egg\" all of the time, and most of the time even multiple at once. Meaning: \"If I even got the chance to build my dream game, it would be one of these!\" (Dream game being the egg.)</p>\n<p>Now I'm a bit older, I don't have that anymore. Which saddens me. Everytime I think of a project now, I think of it in how long it would take and all the other inconviencinces that creating a \"dream project\" brings.</p>\n<p>With this project I wanted to bring back that childish naivety that didn't care about all those things.</p>\n<p>My first computer game ever I made with my brother in Powerpoint, it had over a hundred slides all linked together just to move a character. In the end it was a complete mess to work in, but we loved every minute of making it. Not stopping when we realised it was \"going to be too much work\". (Time was never a factor.)</p>\n<p>So here it is, a project I spend way too much time on.
