It is a dangerous road, too difficult to master yet easy to figure out. Each level is drawn with love and made to be difficult enough to not be impossible.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The platforming part of the game is quite interesting too, since Neon is a ball that cannot jump, he has to make use of his speed and rolling against walls.<br/><br/><strong>Throughout the game, you are tested in precision, planning, and speed. Here are some things to expect:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>You die after a short period of time unless you recharge yourself.<br/><br/></li><li>You will encounter enemies of different types throughout your journey:<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Each level will take you time and effort to complete, but nothing is impossible.<br/><br/></li><li>You can destroy enemies that would otherwise destroy you using special power-ups:<br/><br/></li></ul><br/><strong>Contain your rage and survive!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Note: Free DLCs were planned to expand the game, but that has been canceled in favor of turning them into a full game.</strong><br/><br/>(No Image yet)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T21:34:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/331ebc10e5e31892c1702a9bc0edf203.jpg", "website": "https://www.ahakuo.com/beforedarkdownload", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["AHAKuo", "AHAKuo Creations"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["AHAKuo Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
