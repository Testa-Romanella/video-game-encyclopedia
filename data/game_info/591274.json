But the deeper the two potato-people fall in love, the more difficult the game becomes! The purple bad-looking platforms represent arguments (didn't have the time to properly implement them :frowning2: )! 3 arguments, and you're broken up! That's it! No more tries! Well, unless you press the replay button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like many others, this was my very first Game Jam ever!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did the whole thing (except for the last few hours) on stream at https://www.twitch.tv/cinderblockcreates</p>\n<p>Feel free to come by and say hello!</p>\n<p>While it was pretty tiring, it was certainly a blast! See you guys again in October.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9df1724c31ba015ad948b44242e810f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CinderBlock33"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
