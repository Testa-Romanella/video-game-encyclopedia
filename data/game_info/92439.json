Then return home for respite were you can craft items, go fishing, and learn professions that can help you and your fellow explorers.</p>\r\n\r\nCurrent Progress\r\n<p>We've implemented the main combat and exploration part. The demo version has a few limitations (3x3 biomes, only two biome variants, you can only level up to level 6, no skill system). If you enjoy this version you will soon be able to buy the early access version that has many more stuff implemented and let you play together with friends!<br/></p>\r\nSupport us!\r\n<p>Want to help support us during the development and enjoyed the demo? Consider buying us a coffee (5$) and getting access to an extended demo, which gives you another biome type\u00a0and allows you to explore past level 6 content! (Up to level 11)<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD - Movement<br/>Mouse - Look around<br/>Left Mouse Button - Auto Attack<br/>Left Shift - Evade<br/>F- Interact</p>\r\nMore Information\r\n<p>Feel free to chat with us on Discord: http://discord.gg/93RQdvz</p>\n<p>Subscribe for our newsletter: http://sunex-games.de</p>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SuneXGames</p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook: https://facebook.com/SuneXGames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c56a28b4004d499ac8b3b1bc312a2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuneX Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
