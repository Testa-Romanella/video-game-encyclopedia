It's a small game for this reason.. In this game you can play two ways on your own or with up to three other players in local play. Your goal is to ram into the other players off the screen at the same time you must avoid red walls. If you are playing on your own you have six levels to beat a great thing for speed running. If you have some friends to play with you have twelve maps to battle on. This game has a simple art because I'm no artist and working on this alone. This was made with\u00a0 Clickteam Fusion 2.5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb0429292b8a6d7a7492372f81648640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sithtrooper"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
