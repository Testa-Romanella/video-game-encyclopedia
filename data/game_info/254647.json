Each object collected increases the speed of the game making it more difficult. Avoid colliding with the skulls they can take a life out of you. Good luck, and good fun in overcoming your record.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has a very simple intuitive control - only 2 keys \"up\" and \"down\", so the game will appeal to even the smallest players. And at the same time, the game is gaining just a hardcore speed, which can be too tough for even experienced gamers.
