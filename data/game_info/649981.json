Seeing as I go by Nate Bit Games\u00a0I just had to submit something!\u00a0Due to working solo on this jam and working my night job\u00a0AND being ill for a couple days I spent most of the timeframe of the jam focused on the gameplay mechanics and AI.\u00a0 I didn't have much time left to play test near as much as I would have liked to in order to balance the gameplay difficulty levels. As a result I think it may be almost impossible to beat on Hard Mode - if anyone is so inclined to take on the challenge and can beat Hard Mode please let me know...will update it after the jam to make it beatable if not. Easy mode may also be TOO easy so if you want to see the ending (which is where the lore for the jam comes in) then I would suggest playing on Easy but Normal Mode is also achievable.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I also originally intended for this to be an in\u00a0 browser HTML5 game but ran into some audio glitches\u00a0 so decided to stick with the EXE for now. Will see if I can resolve the audio glitches later and allow for play in browser.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Once the jam is over at some point\u00a0I might work on improving the game overall and also see about adding a mini-map to make tracking the driver easier\u00a0- something I wanted to do from the start but ran out of time. Also considering adding some other interactions that keep the driver delayed like breaking fire hydrants or traffic lights. If there are any bugs to report or any suggestions you might have let me know in the comments!
