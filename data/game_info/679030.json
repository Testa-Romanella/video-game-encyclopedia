Simply put, it is walking around on a map full of bugs. Try to interact! The movement of the camera can be controlled by touching the edge of the screen with the mouse. Number keys 1 and 2 can zoom in and zoom out respectively. The movement of the player touches the ground with the mouse. Press \"G\" to pick up items on the ground, and \"E\" to eat some items. The details of the game are not very complete. Suggestions are welcome. Thank you for every player\uff01</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/663/663696b02532813828ddc7745c3276a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AQiiiii"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
