There are four caves in increasing challenginity, though you must pay the gatekeeper first to advance to the next cave.</p>\n<p>The game is very much still being worked out, although there are quite a few levels that can be played as is. The shops and evil wizard/story elements have yet to be added, as well as cosmetic work.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you start out with just one life, but you can purchase more. In this test version, you start with 50 lives.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move around and the down arrow key to interact. Press space to stop/play a random song. Feedback is very welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dd7580e825faf50c97d62dac43125eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Buck"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
