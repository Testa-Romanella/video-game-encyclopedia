When the first character speaks (the punk guy) the background color is black, the second character (the woman) has a green background, the third character (the man with a hat) has an orange background, and the last character (the guy with moustaches)\u00a0has a red background. Each one will recall where they were (the pit, the hut, the manor or the dock) and who did they encounter there. Warning because they could lie, especially in later cases which are increasingly difficult\u00a0(there are six cases).</p>\n<p>They will do this exploration of their own memory three times that correspond to three different hours in that day. One tip: the hooded character is always the murderer.</p>\n<p>Then, after watching the testimony of each character, after the 3 hours (or before) you must decide which one is the murderer. The down arrow corresponds to the punk guy, the left arrow to the woman, the up arrow the man in a hat, the right arrow the man with moustaches.</p>\n<p>Once you press the arrow you will know if your choice was correct because a part of a note will appear, you must collect six note pieces, corresponding to the six cases. If you were wrong, you will know because that word (Wrong!) will appear onscreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T08:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2bad7bf5831907a61d6f5b12828f389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mauisland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
