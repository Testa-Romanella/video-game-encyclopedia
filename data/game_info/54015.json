It is a westernized conversion (including changes to all of the sprites and backgrounds) of the Japanese arcade game Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093, which roughly translates to &quot;Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio&quot;), released earlier the same year by Technos. It is an immediate technological predecessor to Double Dragon, and Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun is the inaugural game in the Kunio-kun series (which includes Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom).<br />\nRenegade first introduced several trademarks of the beat &#39;em up genre, including 4-directional control, punch-jump-kick play action, and enemies which can sustain multiple hits. It is considered to be one of the most influential titles of the video game industry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T18:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a65/a65aeaeb7dd45c2424f12eab2c77fac6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 12, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 25, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "SEGA Master System", "NES", "Apple II", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["Techn\u014ds Japan", "Technos Japan"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
