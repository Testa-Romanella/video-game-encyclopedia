Our engineers are dedicated to delivering an ultra realistic F18 simulator.  <br/><br/>Every aspect of landing on an aircraft carrier is in this simulator, including multiple arresting cables, pilot nav system, cockpit chatter, and more.<br/><br/>The advanced physics system results in spectacular crashes.  In some cases, failed landings are the most rewarding. Upload your crash replays directly to Youtube or save them on your device.<br/><br/>Think you can master landing on an aircraft carrier?  Try your skills at Night, guided by the vis system, carrier lights, cockpit chatter, and the light of the moon.<br/><br/>No two landings are ever the same.  See if you can rise the ranks of the leader board.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Console quality graphics<br/>- Day and night modes<br/>- Full approach and quick approach modes<br/>- Advanced crash physics system<br/>- Replays from any angle<br/>- Multiple camera views including fully modeled cockpit<br/>- Fully modeled aircraft carrier including arresting cables, vis system, radar, etc.<br/>- Landing grading system measures weight on the wheels, distance to center line, arresting cable touch points, etc.<br/>- Leader boards and rankings", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/1687f0494983f746e10088c957b41b96.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Flight Systems"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Flight Systems"], "esrb_rating": null}
