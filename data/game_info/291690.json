In the aftermath, she found that there's was only one healthy egg left. Now momma bird needs to build a new home for herself by gathering twigs in the trees before time runs out. She's doing it all for her precious egg. Gameplay similar to if Flappy Bird had a stamina meter and the level design of a Metroidvania game. Get ready for a race against the clock, maze-like levels and obstacles, and mastery of flapping!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kyle Harrington - Designer/Producer/Writer,</p>\n<p>Patrick Pfeiffer - Programmer,</p>\n<p>Ted Won - Programmer,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cynthia Tsao - Artist,</p>\n<p>James Yamagata - Audio/Composition</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/7355149ee79894e56461c0fc8bf89bfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Fox Game Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
