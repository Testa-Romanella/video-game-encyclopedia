The meter at the bottom shows how far you've come in the level and the distance to your destination. Once you reach it, you are given your points and move on.</p>\r\nENEMIES\r\n<p>During the Action Stage, enemies spawn as you make the level scroll forward. Hitting them with your whip will make them run off and award you points!\r\n</p>\n<p>Here are the enemy types:\r\n</p>\r\nBat\r\n<p>Comes in from the right side and travels to the left. Flying above, so you have to jump to hit it. Watch your head!\r\n</p>\r\nGhost Jellyfish\r\n<p>Travels from the left side to the right. Is at player height, so you must jump to avoid it!\r\n</p>\r\nDangling Spider\r\n<p>Will come down from the ceiling in an attempt to touch the player. Be careful!\r\n</p>\r\nBig Spider\r\n<p>It's big, pink, and shoots a web forward as it comes in. You'll have to be careful about jumping away before you can attack!\r\n</p>\r\nSPIDER LORD\r\n<p>In the last levels, the Spider Lord will get an interest in you and come close to deal with you himself.\r\n</p>\n<p>He has his eyes closed, but right before attacking his mandibles twitch. The waves of sound it sends out will hurt you! To avoid them, you must stop moving: return to the left side of the screen and make the level stop scrolling. When the spider closes his eyes again, it's safe to proceed.</p>\r\nPUZZLE SCREEN\r\n<p>The adventurer can't advance unless he can choose the right item to insert in the slot. You are given a reward of 1000 points for guessing correctly - but every mistake will cut the reward in half, so pick carefully!</p>\r\nSpider Runes\r\n<p>Above the slot, ancient runes appear. Those indicate what item is required to advance.</p>\n<p>Make sure to keep your manual handy, so you can decipher the meaning of each word and pick correctly!</p>\r\nMINIMAP SCREEN\r\n<p>Between levels you will see a map of the spider's kingdom, and an icon of your player on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It tells you how far along the game\u00a0you've come, and how many levels are left.</p>\r\nBehind The Scenes\r\n<p>One of the most satisfying projects I've had the pleasure to complete.</p>\n<p>And proof once again that no matter how much time I have to finish a game, I can still think that I could've used more time to really nail it down.</p>\n<p>But I think this is a very good game - a big game too, for what I'm used to!</p>\n<p>And I am in a strange spider mood, which this game has filled in wonderfully!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T17:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/040/040cac51f927f60f562afa3bf1c6a791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
