Our planet was embroiled in the battle to end all battles \u2013 The Final War. Cities disappeared, nations perished and our planet was scarred almost beyond recognition. Four hundred years later, in AD 2700, the humankind is thriving again; the wars have been left behind, most of the planet has been rebuilt and technology has achieved ultimate synergy with nature and Laws of Physics. To preserve the memory of our violent past, a symbolic competition called the Skyfront Tournament was created. Contestants from around the world compete in zero gravity arenas for the title of Guardians \u2013 Keepers of the Peace. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo you have what it takes to become the Master Guardian?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/99320749acffc0e68e7484c26b8d1c4a.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/SkyfrontVR/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Levity Play"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Levity Play"], "esrb_rating": null}
