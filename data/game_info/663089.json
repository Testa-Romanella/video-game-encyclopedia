Tangrams can be viewed as a minimalist artform in which seven simple flat shapes are arranged (without overlapping) to create a seemingly infinite number of abstract objects. Minimalism is all about removing unnecessary details from an object or idea while still retaining its core identity, and tangrams test this concept to its limits.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/668dc13e69c88f39296a04d1d5a2b3e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard Stack"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
