You and 14 others have been kidnapped and forced to compete for your lives in a series of challenges, hosted by a mysterious woman called Lady Luck. When the group is split into 3 teams you learn the horrible truth of this game; to win means to sentence your opponents to death. <br/><br/>Lady Luck proclaims these 15 strangers to be Thieves, and for that reason, she has brought them here, to fight for their lives. They must complete all 7 of Lady Luck's Challenges. As the game goes on, the more thieves die. In the end, only the survivors will be allowed to leave.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>    An engaging story of trust and betrayal<br/></li><li>    Complex and dynamic puzzles to solve<br/></li><li>    Immersive 1st-Person Gameplay<br/></li><li>    Fully explorable Escape Rooms with VN-style artwork<br/></li><li>    A cast of unique characters with their own goals and personalities</li></ul><br/><br/>Thief's Roulette is a first person puzzle game with visual novel-style interactions, largely driven by a character-driven story and intensive puzzle-based problem solving gameplay.<br/><br/>Before each of Lady Luck's 7 Challenges, the 15 Contestants are randomly assigned to 3 teams. From there, they will enter their respective Challenge Rooms and attempt to complete the task the fastest. The catch, is that both 2nd and 3rd Place teams will have to take part in the Marking Roulette. Members of these 2 teams are randomly Marked for Death. If you are ever Marked twice, you will be Executed. <br/><br/>For the 2nd Place team, the Roulette spins once. Only one player in that team will end up with a Mark. For the 3rd Place team, the Roulette spins twice. With two spins, two players will be marked, or one player could be marked twice...<br/><br/>When a team gets 1st Place, one player from that team is randomly selected to receive the Trade Token. The 3rd Place team will have one player randomly selected to receive the Reroll Token.<br/><br/>The Trade Token can only be used right after the teams have been scrambled. With this token you may swap places with anyone else on any team. The Reroll Token can only be used right after the Marking Roulette. With it, the thieves may choose to reroll the marking process. Perhaps for a more ideal result.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Morgan | Viktoria | Protagonist | Ice | Ruby</strong><br/><br/><strong>M | Alise | Li | Lillian | Roland</strong><br/><br/><strong>Isaac | Adhira | Joy | Inamori | Roger</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T03:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/9243b455705ec83cde651e80263560d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["hiromu656"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Top Hat Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
