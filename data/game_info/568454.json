I was able to submit my game! It was a pretty rough ride making this, honestly (^^;</p>\n<p>Anyway, the topic of the jam was \"Failure is Progress\" or \"messing with the concepts of winning or losing.\" I had an idea where you were an enemy whose objective was to kill players, so in return this game was born. Kinda vague in my opinion, but this is my best at designing skills ^u^;<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you will enjoy this game, as I did!</p>\n<p>(By the way, click around in the menu for a potential surprise...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ab/1abf3d883b86321caddfcaee0cf9a8a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kwago Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
