There are planned RPG elements that are supposed to be the game, which may or may not added in future builds.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>Arrow keys to move<br/>Enter to interact with doors.</p>\n<p><em>*Game works best played in windowed 640x480 resolution.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b9/7b96210dcd98709c415e7791190d49a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pink Milk", "Chelsumi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
