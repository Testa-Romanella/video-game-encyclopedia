You can do this by planting seeds of corn into the available tiles. If a seed successfully ends its life cycle you will be rewarded with lots of money from your clients! Each 5 days a tile change its current growth state, and you receive small amounts of money so you can keep your business running!</p>\n<p>Be careful with supply-demand and marginal utility, don't sell tiles that are almost finishing their life cycle.</p>\r\nIssues\r\n<p>Please report any issue to the official\u00a0issue tracker on github</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game, post your thoughts!
