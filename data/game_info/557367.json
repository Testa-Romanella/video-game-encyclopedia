The approach to the theme was that I animated things that\u00a0turn on and off. This game is a simple Memory game with 33 diffrent cards. Each card is a 84x48 pixel\u00a0animation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 2 playmodes:</p>\n<ul><li>1 Player: the game gives you a random\u00a0card each turn that you need to find. The number of turns are counted. Try to find all matches with as few rounds as possible.</li><li>2 Player: classic memory, the player with the most matching cards wins</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controles</strong></p>\n<ul><li>move up: W or Numpad 8</li><li>move down: S or Numpad 2</li><li>move Left: A or Numpad 4</li><li>move right: D or Numpad 6</li><li>Confirm: E or Numpad 5</li><li>Cancle: Q or Numpad 0</li></ul><p>Note: there is currently no way to quit out of a running game, so just reload the page and there is also no Sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:32:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Seskon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
