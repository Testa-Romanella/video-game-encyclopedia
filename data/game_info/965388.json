With the goal of the game to obtain the highest score as either a team or a solo player.<br/><br/><br/>Jump into chaotic battles with Project Chaos signature mode: Chaos. Where with each life you spawn with a completely different loadout. Use the constant changes to learn new weapons, experiment with different playstyles or just enjoy the bonkers mess the gamemode produces.<br/><br/>Or for the more classic players, jump into the normal Team Death Match and Free For All gamemodes, where you can use your pre-set loadout in an attempt to cause as much chaos as physically possible.<br/><br/><br/>You can only cause so much chaos with a stick, so Project Chaos only the provides the most powerful weapons for players to wield.<br/>With options like:<br/><ul><li>Smart Rocket Launchers,<br/></li><li>.50 Cal Snipers, <br/></li><li>Miniguns, <br/></li><li>Lightning SMG\u2019s,<br/></li><li>Full Auto Incendiary Shotguns,<br/></li><li>and much more make up the in game arsenal.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T04:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ba/1ba16424f5df672d059deda535842059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4A50 Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["4A50 Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
