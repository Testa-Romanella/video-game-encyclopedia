This is the second time I'm working with Unity (the first time on my own and outside of university) and is mostly done based on the official Manual.<br/></p><p>Prototype includes: Prefabs, Assets (free from the store), Animation, Sounds, NavMap Enemies, a controllable Player. <br/></p><p>I know it's not much and doesn't even has like a goal or something, but that was not the point. This is meant to be a small test to show my beginner skills in Unity. I'm somewhat happy how fast you can actually make something with Unity and I will probably\u00a0change things in the future (or just work on a \"serious\" and \"real\" project instead) because I really like working on games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T03:10:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e6ead1b07f9d0649dab3d34363a8285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexander T.
