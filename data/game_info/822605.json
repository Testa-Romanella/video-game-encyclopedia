Countless adventurers pass through your doors each day and you experience their adventure stories through short, solitaire-like puzzles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Patron's stories continuously progress forward with their repeated visits to the tavern. Follow along with their\u00a0exciting journeys and vicariously relive your adventuring days once more.\u00a0Just be careful you don't get sucked into another adventure of your own...</p>\n<p><strong>The Demo</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This short demo includes the first story from five different patrons.</p>\n<p>Future content will include:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Additional stories from each of these patrons (including plot interconnecting between them)</li><li>Additional patrons, each with their own stories and challenges</li></ul>\n<p>I'm also trying to hammer down \"fun\" gameplay before working on polishing up the graphics with animations, sounds, shaders, and environmental ambiance.
