{"id": 5706, "slug": "valkyria-chronicles", "name": "Valkyria Chronicles", "name_original": "Valkyria Chronicles", "description": "<p>Valkyria Chronicles takes place during the early period of World War II in a fictional region which is in Europa. The peaceful nation of Gallia is attacked by East European Imperial Alliance because of Ragnite ore which is a petrol in the game&#39;s universe and which Gallia nation has a lot. The main focus of Valkyria Chronicles plot is the resistance against Imperial Army. <br />\nOne of the game&#39;s selling point is the visual style which is similar to cell-shading and looks like it all was drawn with a pencil. This is one of those &quot;playable anime&quot; kind-of games. The gameplay itself is fun yet difficult if a player doesn&#39;t know what to do. It is turn-based and every turn should be well-measured. There are phases of player characters and of enemies. Wins that which is planning his turns more thoughtful. The game also has a strong anti-war message.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2008-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T14:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0d4/0d4e5446db732e2fcce34d1dcb4dd914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 228, "owned": 2364, "beaten": 219, "toplay": 115, "dropped": 189, "playing": 45}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 146, "ratings_count": 405, "suggestions_count": 401, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 406, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
