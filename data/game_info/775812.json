With this design you can swap controllers between the squid and the enemies (editor-time), allowing you to control any character in this game.</p>\n<p>For the enemy controllers I implemented a behavior tree system that was easy to use in Godot's scene graph. Creating custom nodes was the right move, because it made use of the editor's built-in scene graph. That was much easier to manipulate than creating a new editor from scratch.<br/></p>\r\nBehavior Trees\r\n<p>This is an example of a behavior tree in the editor. This one is for the spitting pumpkin enemies. This uses selector nodes, sequence nodes, inverter nodes and what I called \"function\" nodes. These leaf nodes are configured in the details panel and execute code that lives on the enemy controller.<br/></p>\n\r\nState Machine &amp; Controller\r\n<p>Each character implements their own state machine and transitions, as well as their own controllers. You can swap the controller out for a player controller, which will allow you to play the game as another type of character.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf79fb7ab3d1b7e13ed67cd91d6978ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Luft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
