The secrets you keep mean the demon is always close at hand. Can you survive long enough to discover the real you?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Meet Eayan</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Meet Eayan, a curious demon who hunts for dark secrets. He lives off the energy of those with something to hide. And for some reason, he's hunting you. He may seem passive at first but be careful. His behavior changes once he knows he can reach you.
