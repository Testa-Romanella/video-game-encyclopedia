When tropical \n      Suthon Island is invaded by the evil Omminus, the ball-shaped hero, Zip, \n      is summoned to save the day. Using a Wii Remote\u2122 Plus controller, which \n      comes bundled with the game, you\u2019ll fling Zip at targets to smash your \n      way across eight colorful worlds. Swing the Wii Remote Plus controller \n      like a racket and watch Zip bounce around like a pinball to smash \n      through oncoming barriers and enemies in this action sidescroller.\n    </p><p>\n      FEATURES:\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Use the included Wii Remote Plus controller to precisely fling and \n        smash your way through enemies and past barriers with a fun \n        combination of racket motions and pinball game play. The game can also \n        be played using an original Wii Remote controller with a Wii \n        MotionPlus\u2122 accessory (sold separately).\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Hit Zip and watch as he bounces around like a pinball, smashing \n        everything in his path.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        A second player can join the action using an additional Wii Remote \n        Plus or Wii Remote / Wii MotionPlus combo (sold separately) to control \n        Zip\u2019s friend, Pip.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        During the game, Zip and Pip travel through eight fast-action \n        side-scrolling worlds, each culminating in a boss battle. Each level \n        offers a unique challenge as Zip might be shrunk down, fattened up or \n        turned into a heavy steel ball. Other levels turn the action on its \n        head to scroll vertically instead of horizontally.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        The vividly colored worlds include sandy beaches, lush tropical \n        treetops and even underwater grottos.\n      </li>\n<li>\n        FlingSmash has eight unlockable mini-games and eight extra \n        levels \u2013 all playable by one or two players.\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c33d24475f6a3e7b719c1317f1224f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Artoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
