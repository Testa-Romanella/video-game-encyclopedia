{"id": 144558, "slug": "starheim", "name": "Starheim (itch)", "name_original": "Starheim (itch)", "description": "<p>A WIP game that I am using in order to learn how to add all kinds of features, functionality and develop my GameDev skills. This game was started following along with the GameDev.tv Udemy 2D course found here:\u00a0https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D to move left to right and up and down. Press SPACE to jump, and P in game to Pause. More controls to come as they are implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>New Version 1.00:</strong></p>\n<p>Explore Blossom Hills, the first world of Starheim,\u00a0in all its hilariously pink glory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before you get too upset, the cave levels and the mountain top levels will return in a future build once I\u00a0flesh them out into the new 8 level format. Watch this space!</p>\n<p><strong>Please don't hesitate to get in touch with what you like/dislike/would like to see in this game.

Sound is still not where I'd like it to be. I haven't delved deeply enough into the subject to sort it out. This will be taken care of in a future build.</p>\n<p>2. Collisions with enemies should be better, but there may be an outlier or two that doesn't do damage on the first hit.</p>\n<p>3. Some enemies, in some places, will appear to walk behind the foreground. This is not intended and for the most part has been fixed, but a few outliers may remain.</p>\n<p>Version 0.01</p>\n<p>1. On first collision, enemies and hazards won't damage the player, but on subsequent hits, damage will be taken.</p>\n<p>2. Audio for coin pickup does not sound correct and bounces from side to side.</p>\n<p>3. Bats do not have an attack audio clip to play when hitting a player.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Music, SFX, pixel art (including re-colouring sprites), game design and scripting by Jameson Bell with the following exceptions:</p>\n<p><strong>Starheim Asset links and credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Super Platformer Assets:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/super-platformer-assets-42013</p>\n<p>Stephen Challener (Redshrike):</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/bosses-and-monsters-spritesheets-ars-notoria</p>\n<p>Ansimuz.com</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/gothicvania-town</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/mountain-at-dusk-background</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/magic-cliffs-environment</p>\n<p>KnoblePersona</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/ocean-background</p>\n<p>GrafXKid</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/jellybot-enemies</p>\n<p>PWL:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/seamless-cave-in-parts</p>\n<p>FunWithPixels:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/bob-ross-inspired-mountain-background</p>\n<p>Jkjkke:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/background-5</p>\n<p><strong>SFX:</strong></p>\n<p>LiamG_SFX:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/LiamG_SFX/sounds/334234/</p>\n<p>The Game Audio Tutorial:</p>\n<p>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Audio-Tutorial-Practical-Interactive/dp/0240817265</p>\n<p>Godowan</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Godowan/sounds/240469/</p>\n<p><strong>Font:</strong></p>\n<p>Pixel Dead by Press Gang Studios</p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/pixel-dead.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d013d83e09c5f354209065a26dd3e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EvolverSoul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
