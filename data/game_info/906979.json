Eventually a boss will spawn and you will have to fight him to continue the game.</p>\n<p>Igneuos is a game based on fighting and dodging enemies on a small platform. This game is similar to the popular Mario Party Game, Dodge Bomb. This game also has many unique traits including the main character being very goofy-looking even though the bosses and enemies are demons or lava monsters. Another unique thing in this game is the hard game play which is very difficult to get good at. Lastly there is\u00a0 a unique story line which is very well thought and well written. Also Igneous is spelt wrong. Hope you like the game!</p>\n<p>This will be receiving MANY updates until full release so stay tuned!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T13:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed96da7f69e264d753d141a307f3166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Droplet Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
