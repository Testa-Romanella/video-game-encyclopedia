Remember the correct pattern of colors while avoiding the enemies' bullets (or shooting them if you're a pro). Try to beat the developer's high score of 9! I hope you enjoy since this is my first game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T10:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ad/7ad55217ef0c76f45155977826aec04b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["7Teen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
