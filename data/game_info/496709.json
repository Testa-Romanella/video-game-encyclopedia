We have introduced five playable characters, brand new obstacle types, Block Modifiers which can be added to and layered on any block, mod compatibility, an easy-to-use level editor, revamped animations, new sound effects, and a whole lot more. Basically, if you liked the first game, you're going to love this one.<br/><ul><li><h3>What languages does the game support?</h3></li></ul>At the moment, the only language supported is English, but we plan to localize into others, and have already developed the backend to support localization soon!<br/><ul><li><h3>What OS's does the game support?</h3></li></ul>Windows-only at the moment. We do plan to bring this one to more platforms in time. Stay tuned!<br/><ul><li><h3>What accessibility options are available?</h3></li></ul>You can control the game speed, screenshake, and controller rumble levels in the Options menu. There are 4 difficulty selections when you start a new game. You can also control the game via keyboard, mouse, controller, or touchscreen simultaneously.<br/><ul><li><h3>How do I use Gallery Mode?</h3></li></ul>Gallery Mode can currently be controlled via Keyboard shortcuts. Check out the Gallery Mode Instructions guide we've put on the Steam Community for more information. Updates to this are coming very soon!<br/><ul><li><h3>What do I do if a find a bug?</h3></li></ul>Please visit the Bug Reports forum on the Steam Community. We promise we do everything we can to fix any issues found in as speedy a time as possible. We would appreciate it if you not use a Steam Review to report bugs, as we consistently check the Bug Reports forum for any new issues that have appeared. Thank you for understanding and cooperation.<br/><ul><li><h3>What do you mean by \"Partial Controller Support?\"</h3></li></ul>You can currently use a controller (and even a Steam Controller) to start the game, play quick play modes, access the menu, change options, walk around in the museum, etc. You cannot currently use a controller in Mondrian Maker or Gallery Mode. These are areas we're addressing post-launch and are fully committed to bringing the game back up to Full Controller Support ASAP.<br/><ul><li><h3>What is that cool song in the launch trailer?</h3></li></ul>\"Spin Cycle\" by Speechwriters LLC, Licensed under CC BY 3.0.
