I was trying it out solo and it is my first game learning experience\u00a0so a lot of rough edges and sadly it lacks sound and music in there since I ran out of time. After such a learning experience\u00a0I hope to make a game with better features and more content later on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD keys to move and Space bar to interact with objects. I hope to make a mouse-mode for the adventure game fans later.</p>\n<p>The game is a semi-silent game that tries to be more exploration than adventure games though in my game jam I focused on a puzzle-centered segment. I'm hoping in a more expanded game, the story can be told better by the elements in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/00003931d19ab1fe780fc3ecbd60a753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BinaryBeat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
