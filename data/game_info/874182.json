The \"AI\" is limited to simple hunger + mood driven behaviours and some random patterns to make it a little more alive.<br/></p>\n<p>We had fun making it, so we hope that you will have fun playing and experimenting with it.</p>\n<p>This game was done for the\u00a0AI &amp; Games jam in 7 days.</p>\r\nControls:\r\nActionsMouse &amp; KeyboardGamepadInteractLeft mouse button / touchscreennot supportedPause/SettingsEscapenot supported\r\nDebug viewF1not supported\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Art:\u00a0Michael \"Calart\" Pearson</li><li>Audio: \"Bit Bionic\"</li><li>Code:\u00a0Matthew \"Krikit\" Schultz</li><li>Code:\u00a0Colin Bellino\r\n</li><li>Design:\u00a0Ondrej Markus\u00a0and the rest of team.\r\n</li><li>Paid assets:\u00a0No\r\n</li><li>Softwares:\u00a0Godot,\u00a0Aseprite,\u00a0Audacity</li></ul>\r\nSource code:\r\n<ul><li>Source: https://github.com/colinbellino/ai-and-games-2022</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T12:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb9c7298a9d6a77433e0160e6889ac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PronomicalArt", "Colin Bellino", "KriKit", "ondrejmarkus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
