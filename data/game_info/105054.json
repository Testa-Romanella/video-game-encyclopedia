Along the way we meet some of her friends and neighbors, friendly or obstructive. Success will allow Lavinia to create the girlfriend of her dreams, but first she needs to figure out what it is that she actually wants from her.\u00a0<br/><br/>On her side is her own formidable intelligence, a loyal hardware store employee, and a very friendly barista at her favorite coffee shop.
