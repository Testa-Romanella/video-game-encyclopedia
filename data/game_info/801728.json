It is a collection of gameplay mechanics designed for a spaceship shooter game. It features a powerup system with a variety of offensive and defensive abilities. Heavy inspiration for the theme of the project comes from the Sci-Fi scene, namely shows like <strong>Star Trek</strong> and games like <strong>Elite: Dangerous</strong>, which I am a huge fan of.</p>\n<p>Mechanics developed for this project are appropriately encapsulated and all code follows object-oriented programming principles. The project has been made in Unreal Engine 4, and all mechanics are programmed in C++. Gameplay mechanics are designed to interact and work with each other providing emergent gameplay.\u00a0Among features developed are:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement System<ul><li>The player's ship moves at a set velocity, which can be increased and decreased.</li><li>Steering is limited to the ship's turn rate which can be modified to simulate different ship size</li></ul></li><li>Weapons Targeting System<ul><li>Weapons have a limited range</li><li>Automatic targeting and lock on the nearest enemy within range</li></ul></li><li>Powerups<ul><li>Phaser Cannon</li><li>Phaser Beam</li><li>Torpedo Launcher</li><li>Boost</li><li>Decoy Clone</li><li>Cloaking</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>The report document dives into further detail on gameplay mechanics, how they work and interact, and how they were programmed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T08:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052dc97f9b379849bacecb0867d722c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SerOleg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
