It's mostly colorful and lighthearted, though the final game will contain some\u00a0minor\u00a0cosmic horror elements.</p>\n<p>You play as the titular character, Violet, who one day wakes up alone and with no memories. Soon, she finds that a bunch of strange creatures are causing trouble to the animals and people of her world. Fortunately, she somehow possesses a strange ability that lets her fight them, so she decides to stop them!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>~Features~</strong></p>\n<p>-This demo contains several playable semi-open areas, plus three main dungeons, each with a simple, short story. Stories are conveyed through character actions and expressions; no dialogue- except for a short intro on game start.</p>\n<p>-Two elemental \"forms\" that change Violet's attacks and one extra learnable attacking move.</p>\n<p>-Collectible enemy cards which, at a certain point in the demo,\u00a0add flavor text.</p>\n<p>-Aiming for intuitive gameplay with\u00a0satisfying combat and physics. Unintrusive tutorials are available via the pause screen menu.</p>\n<p>-Simple controls inspired by\u00a0platform fighters, playable with a keyboard or an Xinput controller (Xbox or compatible) if one is detected.</p>\n<p>-Mappable inputs, save system, english/spanish support,\u00a0and many other game options.</p>\n<p><strong>~Still in development~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-The full game is planned to\u00a0contain at least seven more dungeons\u00a0and several more areas, as well as more elements, moves, enemies, etc. It'll also be designed so you'll naturally visit some areas more than once without necessarily going backwards; more like a round trip. You will need to go back in the demo if you want to see everything in it, though.</p>\n<p>-A completed percentage indicator will be added to the full game, and possibly to individual areas as well.</p><p>-Cutscenes are short, but\u00a0will be made skippable in the full game.</p>\n<p>-Music for the content in the demo is mostly complete, though almost none of it properly loops. This will be fixed in the full game. The game may also be missing some sounds here and there.</p>\n<p>-There's no hard \"end of demo\" screen. Instead you'll find that some areas are blocked by clearly labeled demo walls.</p>\n\n\n<p>Violet of the Stars is a game I started as a \"simple, easy, solo project\", but it turned out to be much more challenging than expected. That said, working on it has been extremely satisfying and I'm putting all my heart into it. This is my first serious attempt at making a game though, so there may still be some errors. All input is welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T15:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f234ed70e24b718eb8ad6a308b7d4c6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hexer_class"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
