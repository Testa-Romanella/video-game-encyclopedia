The catch? When one moves left, the other moves right. Traverse through uniquely designed levels where when one character's death is tied to the actions of the other, and both are controlled by you, you become your own enemy. Explore the cosmos while remembering your binding of life towards one another. Be wary of spikes, dodge comets, collect stars, and face the Ram's challenge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T12:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/caef34b6254dad947c7c154512979a49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wewewe02", "AnnaGoBrr", "Leoxide", "Killxu", "Kai uyekawa", "jdxl2013", "YukiNoUmi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
