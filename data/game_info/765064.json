Use your instincts to predict your enemies\u2019 movements and counter them. See your orders unfold in victory or utter defeat, in short intense battles! Combine magical tokens, recruit counter units and use various spells to overcome impossible odds.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Play as the leader of the oppressive Human Empire, the brutal Lizard-Orc alliance or the cunning Wizards of light and darkness. Level up your leader and gain new skills allowing you to implement different strategies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each faction offers unique units and creatures, each with their own special abilities and traits. Play to your strengths to emerge victorious!<br/><br/><br/>Circle Empires Tactics offers a wide range of difficulty levels for both single-player and co-op. Choose the difficulty level that fits your experience (or ego), from new recruit to descendant of Sun Tzu. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Play with your friends in 2 vs 2 or PVP with teams. Or tackle the single-player adventure in a solo quest. The question remains the same: how well can you anticipate the actions of your rivals?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A good tactician masters the battlefield. Create maps with your own unique flavor in our powerful map editing tool. Place creatures, resources and obstacles, then take to the field in PvP or Co-Op.
