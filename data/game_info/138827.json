That's you. Your are the monster!</p><p>You need to kill the guards, but all you have is a knife and the ability to summon goblins! <br/>Kill the maidens by holding down the [SPACE] button and collect their blood to perform the summoning ritual and kill all the guards. <br/>Every maiden will give you a certain amount of blood, and will fill up the blood bar on the top of the screen. <br/>When the bar is full, you will summon your minions from hell. <br/>But watch out for the guards, they are too strong and if they see you, it will be hard to escape. <br/>Your best chances are to stay hidden in alleys, behind objects and structures. Your character will fade out when he is properly hidden and you won't be seen by anyone. <br/>Move with your [ARROW KEYS] or [WASD]. <br/>If the maidens see you, they will run for their lives, so try to sneak up from behind them. <br/><br/>Good luck, you monster! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bc/8bc442b9fcfc303dcd7275fa5a872cf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bergara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
