Inspired by the game \u201cDreadstone Keep\u201d by Totem, the game seeks to connect the said game to its own after the \u201cCleanser\u201d Legacy Event. As the main protagonist in Dreadstone Keep manages to kill a hundred enemies, Ligma decides to escape the castle before he gets killed. However, other skeletons found this unfair so they try to stop him, thus he has to face not only the \u201cHero\u201d but also his former brothers as he makes a daring dash before he meets his fate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T12:57:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f5d48a411a6cb20dde1ee5a613395a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yeu Tea Kay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
