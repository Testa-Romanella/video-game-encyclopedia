Like the one in \"lawsuit\" (which, you'll notice, is also invisible).<br/><br/>This short tour of the glories of the UK\u2019s M4 corridor is easy to play, hard to master, addictive, very funny, and cheap.<br/><br/>100% of the profits from this game go to young people\u2019s charity Peer Productions. Without Peer Productions the NotGames team would never have met. By buying this game you can help us pay something back.<br/><br/>NotGames: Sticking it to the virtual man since about ten minutes ago.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FAQ:<br/>Q: Is it meant to look that bad?<br/>A: Yes.<br/><br/>Q: Really?<br/>A: Yes.  Really.  It's satire.  Like South Park.<br/><br/>Q: Is it meant to be just Snake?<br/>A: Again, yes.  That's kinda the point of the satire, see?<br/><br/>Q: So why should I buy it exactly?<br/>A: We guarantee it'll be the funniest game of Snake you've ever played.
