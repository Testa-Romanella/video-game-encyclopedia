The game is set in a fictional world, where due to the scarcity of resources, players play as interstellar travelers shuttling between various planets. While resisting the invaders, they also need to acquire resources. By placing props in the levels, defeating the invading races from other planets, and acquiring resources to upgrade the spaceship and recruit crew members, the players can continuously pass the levels. Eventually, they will obtain a habitable planet and rebuild their homes.\r\n\r\n  The game provides a variety of mechanisms. Players can place blocks such as ground or wall mechanisms to achieve efficient killing of monsters. Different mechanism blocks will also have bonds, producing linked effects and achieving new killing effects. More clever combinations await your attempts!\r\n\r\n  Outside the level, players can upgrade the props to increase the damage of the mechanisms and unlock more mechanism effects; and they can also recruit various heroes through the external Ark module. Heroes will automatically explore resources and help players build resource output more efficiently.\r\n\r\n  At the current stage of the game, we are still in a semi-complete state. Under the integrity of the battle, we will quickly complete the content for battle development. Please look forward to it!\r\n\r\n  Eggy Space Base QQ: 684340879", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T13:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/696b3bca23b77fd982b5d3a3cf861a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u90d1\u5dde\u5e02\u5de6\u57df\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u90d1\u5dde\u5e02\u5de6\u57df\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "esrb_rating": null}
