Founding a new chain of restaurants, you venture across your local town\u00a0in an attempt to earn the support of the locals and increase your income to expand your business. However, watch out for your rivals, who are jealous of your ongoing success and looking to strike you down at the first opportunity.</p>\n<p>Diner Sweep\u00a0is a 4X-style game where you trade a limited set of\u00a0turns with a single AI opponent, collecting money as you move across the grid.\u00a0After earning enough, you can use your currency to purchase restaurants which are placed on the map, strengthening\u00a0your grip on the local dining industry!<br/></p>\n<p>Created for KrassJam 3\u00a0 entirely within 72 hours with the assistance of Christoph Gray (music). Jam\u00a0participants are given a choice of three ridiculously random themes to base their game on. Diner\u00a0Sweep uses\u00a0a combination of two themes:</p>\n<p><strong>\"A game where you slide numbers for the mega-bonus.\"</strong><br/>and<br/><strong>\"A game where you drag and drop restaurants to create a sprawling industry.\"</strong></p>\n<p>I've loved making this game and have many ideas for expanding upon it in the future, as well as an improvement to the art.\u00a0Any feedback you have would be hugely appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b8cfa6115fa19b1bd573a5f6033e63a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["finjo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
