In this game, you want to stay awake, but\u00a0you are so tired that you just can't keep yourself from\u00a0drifting off to sleep! Navigate the maze as quickly as possible\u00a0and collect the lightning bolts that appear to keep yourself awake. You better be quick though, because as time goes on, you will only get more and more tired!</p>\n<p>Note: Play in Fullscreen for the best visual results</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\r\nWASDMove up, left, down, and right\r\nABOUT\r\n<p>This game was made in just under 3 hours for Trijam #87 with the theme of\u00a0<em>Keep drifting</em>. I really wanted to play with the theme a bit and not go with the first thing that came to mind, which was drifting cars. I thought playing with the idea that you continually close and open your eyes as you get more and more tired but\u00a0try to stay awake\u00a0would be interesting, and so <em>Drifting Off</em> was born! I made all the visuals using Adobe Illustrator, the sound effects using Bfxr, and the\u00a0background music is from\u00a0www.fesliyanstudios.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6660ad509ec4b4d4b78642e2d2a205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harrison Rooney"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
