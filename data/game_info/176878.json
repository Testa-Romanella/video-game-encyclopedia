Travel and collect food, water and other items to help you on your journey. Your goal: find 13 alien artifacts to turn back time and prevent the apocalypse.<br/>This ideas was a bit too big for a jam, so while it's finished and not very buggy, it's terribly unbalanced.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Use left mouse button to pick items up and right mouse button to rotate them<br/>- The brown bar is your food, blue bar is your water. When one of them gets to 0 or you get sick you start loosing health (represented by the red bar).<br/>- You location is displayed in the upper-right corner<br/>- Your currenlty held item is displayed below it<br/>- The space under the health is inventory of your current location - when you move they all disappear!<br/>- You can drop some items on other ones to combine them - for example gun and ammo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df038290349dbe6e4fa2abbb9302663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naruvan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
