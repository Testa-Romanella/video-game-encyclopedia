This guy just attracts bugs, or maybe the food he has scattered all over does. Anyway, these bugs are just nasty, and if they can manage it, they will steal your food and run off with it. The nerve of those bugs! Luckily there exists scattered about the playing field, picnic baskets. Grab all the food and put it in the picnic baskets before the bugs take it (and to increase your points multiplier). If you can get all the food in the baskets, or kill all the bugs you win the level. You can also win if less than 75% of the food is taken, but you really shouldn't let those nasty bugs get <strong>ANY</strong> food. <br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Joystick/arrow keys: Move</li>\n<li> Joystick button1 or 'z' on keyboard: Activates your bug sprayer / drops food in hand</li>\n<li> Joystick button 2 or 'x' on keyboard: Vacuum up food you can't reach</li>\n<li>Joystick button 3 or escape on keyboard: Access the in-game menu</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Notes:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Spiders are smart and can steal food that is <strong>NOT</strong> in a food box. </li>\n<li>Roaches are immune to your sprayer.
