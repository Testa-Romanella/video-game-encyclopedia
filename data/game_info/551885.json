To get back home again, Bodil needs to collect four warp cubes. One of these cubes are marked on Bertil's map and the rest are marked on tiny cropped maps available to Bodil. To locate them all, the two need to communicate with each other. Luckily there are a lot of weird distinct landmarks around.\u00a0Note that warp cubes are highly unstable so when collected, they will teleport Bodil to a random position on the map.</p>\n<p>The game is played in networkless co-op with two people on different computers. To play on the same map, they simply have to enter the same map name (seed) on setup.</p>\n<p><em>Made during\u00a0Global Game Jam 2021, on the\u00a0LiU Game Jam\u00a0site, based on the theme\u00a0Lost and Found.</em></p>\r\nControls\r\nRunner (Bodil)\r\n<p><strong>Movement\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0WASD<br/><strong>Jump</strong>|\u00a0Space<br/><strong>Tab</strong>| Show hints</p>\r\nReader (Bertil)\r\n<p><strong>Pan</strong><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong>| Hold and drag left mouse button<br/><strong>Zoom\u00a0</strong>|\u00a0Scroll wheel</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Axel Nordanskog</strong>2D sprites, 3D modelling (soup)<strong>Christian Hansson</strong>sound<strong>Erik Mans\u00e9n</strong>programming, UI<strong>Frans Skarman</strong>OwO man<strong>Henrik Henriksson\r\n</strong>3D modelling (bloon, crystal, powerplant, shroom, spaceship, statues)<strong>Jesper Tingvall</strong>programming, map generation<strong><strong>Max Shelest</strong></strong>3D modelling (arch, flying weird, stones, trees, weed)<strong><strong>Nickita Boykov</strong></strong>programming, movement<strong>Sophie Ziske</strong>concept art\r\n<p><strong>Additional sound effects<br/></strong>Fire\u00a0by\u00a0Mike Koenig<br/>Dreamscape Drone\u00a0by\u00a0jdagenet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c4c07ee1372952092ea3e45fa0b628e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["J3X", "Axerosh", "Ethamerax", "300bucks", "BurnedTuner"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
