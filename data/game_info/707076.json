Beginning the game you must traverse the internal chaos of an infected machine riddled with malware, and other viruses fighting your way through to the heart of the virus and destroying it.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is not as easy as it seems with powerful enemies ready to dismantle your code you will need to find some tools to help you on your way. From armor-piercing ammunition to an energy barrier, and a super jump, all will be required to clear the entire system of enemies. The enemies you will be fighting vary greatly from one another, from the tanky Roaches who eat up damage as they rush towards you, to the Wasps who prefer to target you from long distances with high powered shots to take you down, these enemies and their upgraded counterparts are waiting for you inside cyberspace ready to tear you apart bit by bit. But don't worry, the next version of Norton is always ready to try again where its predecessor failed.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Explore the vast internal arrays of this cyber system from corrupted subroutines to malfunctioning CPUs, and defective hard drives all of which contain their own dangers and rewards to help you progress further towards ridding this machine of viruses. The other tool helping you through the system is Terminal Access Systems Key, or Task for short, who is the AI who is assisting you on this mission. In the depths of Anti-Virus bugs and monsters await you, the only remaining question is, are you good enough to defeat them?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>Move Left/Right - A/D</p><p>Jump - W</p><p>Shooting - Arrow Keys</p><p>Shield - Q</p><p>Change Weapon Type - Spacebar</p><p><strong>Group Members:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Lead Programmer &amp; Co-Producer - <strong>Jacob Grenke</strong></p>\n<p>Game Direction, Art Design &amp;\u00a0Co-Programmer - <strong>Christopher Merriman</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Writer &amp;\u00a0Co-Producer - <strong>Connor Gurley</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9f7f3b96ecaf4e47035a7183124f19d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["M4dK1ng"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
