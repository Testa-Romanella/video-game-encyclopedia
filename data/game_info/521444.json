{"id": 521444, "slug": "maze-world", "name": "Maze World", "name_original": "Maze World", "description": "<p>This small game was one of my 2019/2020 submissions for my<strong><em> programming</em></strong> module. <br/>The goal was not to focus on the art-style and animations on this game, but rather the programming itself. <br/><br/>The brief was to create a game prototype based on a game we chose from a list. The game that inspired this one was \"Maze Planet 3D\".<br/><br/>It was made in Unity, using C#. I must say that although it is a really simple concept I did encounter some challenges when making it. <br/></p>\n<p>One of them was the player's movement. As the \"ground\" is a sphere and not a plane, if I would have used the player's rigid body gravity, it would have fallen into space. Therefore I set the gravity in unity to 0 (zero) and to create a system of two scripts to fake it. One of the scripts, \u201cGravity attractor\u201d is attached to the planet object and the other script \u201cGravity_Body\u201d is attached to the player. The player script is calling in update the function\u00a0 \u201cAttract\u201d from the \u201cGravity_Attractor\u201d script, which in every frame is calculating\u00a0 the normal position and rotation of the player, so his local Y axis is always pointing towards the sky. <br/><br/>Also the game has a small progress saving system, which basically uses a binary saving data system. It encrypts and stores the data and it cannot be deleted unless doing it on purpose.
