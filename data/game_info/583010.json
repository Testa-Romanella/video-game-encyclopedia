The graphics are \"programmer\" art for testing mechanics. This project is entirely for experimental purposes as I needed to figure out how I would structure and blueprint the AI for a bigger project. There's also some work on better parent/child blueprint structuring I wanted to check before redoing part of the aforementioned bigger project.</p>\n<p>I'll add more content/features if people enjoy/want more.\u00a0Potential features I already have in mind:\u00a0<br/>Choose your starting genetics, genetic upgrades after breeding, species customisation, better graphics, diegetic UI, other levels, etc</p>\n<p>Controls are shown in-game, but you can play it with just the mouse if you want.</p>\n<p>TLDR: Here's a little experimental game\u00a0you can play if you like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please consider donating, even if it's not much, it really helps and you'll have my undying appreciation. Thanks and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cd92c3dacfb1d8d6c7b299513ef9caf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrispyLizard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
