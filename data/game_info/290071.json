Also, we have added skill system to make the game more different. Besides,we have an escaping scene and an escape system in the game. Haha, you will like them.<br/>\r\nPS: We have adapted English, Russian, Portuguese and Chinese, which should be enough for you to use.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you hit the \"W\" key to jump in parkour, you can press the number keys \"1\",\"2\" and \"3\" to use three different skills.And skill 2 and 3 can be cancelled by pressing the \"S\" key during using. Skills need to obtain by picking up question mark items , but priority to obtain life. With a certain probability you will enter the forest scene, at this moment,press \"A\" or \"D\"  to run towards left or right. Press the \"S\" key exit the grass.There will be a reciprocal time in the scene. Before the time runs out, you must enter the grass which will show up in a random position after a period of time. And then you will avoid bird's prey, otherwise you will be caught and then enter the bird-claw scene. The bird-claw scene is very simple. You just keep pressing the \"H\" key until the red slot is full and you can break away and return to the parkour scene.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81f75bdf5d619e9ff183a187cd227230.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K1Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["K1Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
