But the crystal has cracked and you must retrieve shards of it instead! Crystal shards are only on some levels such as 2 and 4. In order to progress further you must go through portals but on levels with crystal shards you must collect the crystal shards first. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes;<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I left the water gun in but it doesn't damage enemies.</p><p>Also this style is inspired by benbonk watch his pico 8 video!<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0Further notes:\r\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 This may be a bit long.</p>\n<p>This is my first game that I would call a game, I do have one more project up but I'm not that proud of it and there was also a lot more planned for it that I never got around to doing. This game is made in Godot (as stated by the the gdwild game jam I put in the tagline), my first full project in it. I know that it may not be the best game but I'm happy with it and I've learnt a lot during this jam.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 One more note, I plan to add sound effects and music but I don't want to miss the deadline. They probably will come though. Also please give constructive criticism \u00a0so I may learn what I did wrong and right with this game.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:38:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13d641e9a540374fc9ccf60f174cc02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EmeraldBear"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
