Two of the three creators were not CSUMB students, and as a result, the game will not be eligible for monetary prize.</p>\n\n<p>Deep in the midwater of Monterey Canyon, the denizens can't see the surface's light. There is no delicious plants or algae for them to eat. To avoid starving, a humble comb jelly must eat detritus falling from the ocean surface before shrimps and squid snatch them up. At the same time, it must avoid becoming a meal itself as carnivorous fish and jellies prowl for food, our friend guided only by the bioluminescent glows produced by their forms. How long can the gelatinous soul survive before meeting its fate?</p>\n<p>Use WASD to navigate the comb jelly through its dangerous and illuminous 2d environment.</p><p>4/19/2022 Update: An object in the game was not despawning properly, causing lag to build up quickly. This has been fixed.</p>\n<p>The .zip contains a .exe and a .pck.\u00a0Make sure the files are extracted and the\u00a0.pck file is in the same directory as the .exe when you run the .exe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T21:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f8524ef3af29b7aa3ca7c64e2e50dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArctonoeVittata"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
