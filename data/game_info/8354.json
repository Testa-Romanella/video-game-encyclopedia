In your quest to find your people, you\u2019ll set off on a galactic adventure where you\u2019ll meet a host of colorful characters and visit unimaginable locations.<br/><br/>Out There Chronicles is a unique adventure set several million years before Out There.  Where do the Arks come from? What are the Cubes? Fans of the original game will find answers to some questions, but others will remain a mystery.  <br/>You\u2019ll also meet various alien races and get the opportunity to learn more about their people\u2026 If you can master their language, of course.  <br/><br/>In this universe that is so far from your own in distance and in time, a sharp mind and an instinct for survival are your only weapons. Friendships can be forged and ancient rivalries re-emerge through your encounters with almost-human and less-human races. Will you be able to distinguish friend from foe?<br/>As in the original game, a single human is unable to face the forces of the universe alone. Achieve your goals by exercising diplomacy when needed, and seizing opportunities when they present themselves.  <br/><br/>Written by FibreTigre, author of the original game, Out There Chronicles offers an epic story that will delight science fiction fans in search of new experiences.  <br/>Brilliantly illustrated by top French SF artist, Benjamin Carr\u00e9, and equipped with a simple interface, Out There Chronicles will take you on a journey of adventure, even if you\u2019ve never played a video game before.<br/><br/>Features<br/>\u2022 80 achievements<br/>\u2022 An interactive science fiction graphic novel written by FibreTigre (Out There)<br/>\u2022 A complex dialogue system: your choices can have consequences later in the adventure<br/>\u2022 Master the alien language and discover their cultures<br/>\u2022 Stunning, varied environments<br/>\u2022 Develop relationships with an array of complex characters<br/>\u2022 Revelations on the Out There universe<br/>\u2022 A simple, accessible interface<br/>\u2022 Magnificent illustrations by Benjamin Carr\u00e9, the French master of science fiction<br/>\u2022 Captivating music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn (Antichamber, Out There\u2026)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T13:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b43a9702b2a5d251a96989cc728b7b.jpg", "website": "http://chronicles.outtheregame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Mi-Clos Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Mi-Clos Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
