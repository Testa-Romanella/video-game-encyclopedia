You landed your sorry little ship in a small hostile arena with no hope of escape. The best you can do is exercise your unquestionably awesome trigger finger to earn yourself a few more minutes ... nay ... seconds of precious life!</em></strong>\n<p>Final Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way <em>(.. ahem... you'll need them).\u00a0</em>Enemies increase in number and difficulty as waves progress. They're worth more points each wave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you've slain enough enemies without meeting your end, power-ups will be dropped in the center of the area. But hurry - they disappear after 10 seconds if you don't pick them up.<br/></p>\n<p>Let's be honest, you're not looking at this game for depth of story or the latest cutting edge VR experience. You're looking at this because you want to shoot stuff! You want to shoot lots of stuff! Now go forth, have fun, and die with honor.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Endless Waves of Enemies</li><li>Boss / Challenge Waves</li><li>15 Local Achievements<ul><li>Use your free Steam Key to register the game with Steam and the achievements will be sync'd Steam Achievements!</li></ul></li><li>5 Power-ups</li><li>An Awesome Soundtrack</li><li>Thumbs aching with Joy</li></ul>\n\n<p>Follow Me in the TwitterVerse!<br/></p>\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\n<p>Enemies spawn from one of 4 spawn points around the board. All 4 spawn points are active during a wave so be careful not to be on top of one too long.</p>\r\nEnemies\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Meteors\r\n            They're slow and don't chase you, but if they bump into you, you're going to feel it.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Drones\r\n            These little guys randomly move around the board slowly, but have a small detection field around them. If they sense you, they'll pick up speed and come after you.\u00a0\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Vipers\r\n            Similar to the drones, but they're built to track you down. They have a much larger detection field and can move much faster than Drones.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Seekers\r\n            These missiles have one purpose, seek and destroy. They are the fastest enemy on the board! Watch out for them.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Rail Gunners\r\n            <br/>Rail gunners patrol the edges of the arena. They slide back and forth on a particular arena wall to prevent anyone from hiding there. Oh - and they launch missiles across the board to clear anything away that shouldn't be there. Those missiles are dumb and don't chase you but there sure can be a lot of them!\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Sentinels\r\n            Sentinels are similar to Vipers. Their key difference is that they have a cannon similar to yours and they're not afraid to use it! The good news is, if you're a crack shot, you can shoot their bullets before they shoot you!\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\nPower-ups\r\n<p>If you shoot enough enemies and live long enough, you'll pick up power-ups to help you in your battle. If you're lucky enough to get more than one power-up, you'll be allowed to select one to keep after you die for being such an excellent contender!</p>\r\nEnergy Shield\r\n<p>This passive power-up surrounds your ship with a force field that can withstand up to 3 impacts.<br/></p>\n\r\nTri Shot\r\n<p>This passive power-up is a weapon upgrade. Because 3 bullets are better than one. Fires 3 bullets from your main cannon giving you a 30 degree field of fire!</p>\n\r\nSide Shot\r\n<p>This passive power-up is a weapon upgrade. Fires a bullet to the left and right of your ship's direction . Of course you can still pivot your main cannon. Helps to protect your flanks! </p>\n\r\nFreeze Wave (Special Weapon)\r\n<p>This is an active power-up. When you pick up this item an icon of an icy snowflake will appear next to your life meter. Launch this weapon with your Right bumpers or triggers. Ice your enemies and stop them in their tracks for 6 seconds of glorious relief! </p>\n\n\r\nAnd Laze-Blade!\r\n<p>This is an active power-up. When you pick up this item an icon of a sweeping laser will appear to the right of your score. Launch this item with your Left bumpers or triggers. Slam a spinning blade of flaming death into your enemies for about 6 seconds and take satisfaction in their cries of agony!</p>\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game is in the end stages of development.  For less than the cost of your favorite energy drink you can get your twin-stick groove on, support this game and more to come!\r\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<p>While this game CAN be played with keyboard and mouse it's really hard that way. It is\u00a0<strong><em>best played with a Gamepad or XBox controller.</em></strong>\u00a0 Any gamepad supporting X-Input should work. This game has been tested with XBox 360 Controllers, MadCat generic Xbox controllers, Logitech 310 and 8bitdo NES30.</p>\r\nGamepad Controls\r\n<p>Any gamepad supporting X-Input with dual sticks configured for your operating system should work.</p>\n<ul><li>D-Pad Navigates Menu</li><li>\"A\" Button (Bottom Green on XBox Controller) selects menu items</li><li>Left stick moves your ship</li><li>Right stick fires your weapon</li><li>Right Trigger/Bumper fires Freeze Wave</li><li>Left Trigger/Bumper fires Laze-Blade</li><li>START button pauses in-game</li></ul>\r\nKeyboard and Mouse\r\n<p><em>(warning - it's hard with keyboard and mouse.

I'm not even done optimizing it yet and it runs on relatively old hardware. It was developed and tested on an old ASUS ROG laptop from 2012. It has been tested on more hardware and seems to do pretty well with almost any computer after 2012. It does spray a lot of bullets though and the more horsepower your computer has, the smoother the experience is guaranteed to be. That said here are some specs:</p>\r\nMinimum Specs:\r\n<p><strong><em>Currently I'm only doing 64-bit builds until I get better access to 32-bit test hardware.</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Any Intel or AMD processor produced since 2012 running Windows 7,8,10, OSX or Linux.\u00a0</li><li>4 GB RAM (Does anyone have less than 4 GB now? The application MAY run with less but has not been tested under those conditions)\u00a0</li><li>Updated OpenGL graphics drivers. The engine uses OpenGL 2.0 which most graphics cards within the last 7 years should be compatible with.</li></ul>\r\nSpecs that'll make the application sing with joy:\r\n<ul><li>Any Intel i5 or i7 or comparable AMD since 2012</li><li>8 GB of RAM or more</li><li>NVIDIA 660 or higher or comparable AMD</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n<p>As a one-man company this game would have taken a lot longer to make without many of the great assets on opengameart.org .\u00a0The artists listed below posted their content\u00a0and in return, they ask to be recognized for the work they did.\u00a0So here are the incredible artists that helped make this game\u00a0possible.</p>\n<p>They are listed in the game credits but we'll list them here as well:</p>\n<p>Space Ships (License CC-BY 3.0) by\u00a0Lamont Miller</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/ktd-art</p>\n<p>https://virgate.wixsite.com/portfolio/gameart</p>\n<p>Weapon and Shield Gfx - by Tatermand</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/2d-shooter-effects-alpha-version</p>\n<p>tatermand@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Laser Sounds (License CC-BY 3.0) by\u00a0dklon<br/>Boom Pack (License CC-BY 3.0) by dklon<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/laser-fire<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/boom-pack-1<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Laser Shooting SFX (License CC0-Public Domain) by\u00a0teckpow<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/lasershootingsx<br/><br/></p>\n<p>HexagonTile (License CC-BY 3.0) by\u00a0Dustin 'Crimzan' Ludwig<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-hexagon-texture<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Music (License CC-BY 3.0) by alexandr-zhelanov<br/>https://opengameart.org/users/alexandr-zhelanov<br/>https://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov</p>\n<p>Explosion Graphics - (CC0-Public Domain) by\u00a0Sinestesia<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/2d-explosion-animations-2-frame-by-frame<br/>http://www.sinestesiastudio.com/</p>\n<p>Missile Launch Sounds (License CC-BY 3.0) by\u00a0Michael Baradari<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/4-projectile-launches<br/>http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&amp;thread_id=2164<br/>Sounds (c) by Michel Baradari apollo-music.de<br/>Submitted by qubodup</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/8070d8f3e8acf816e5aff04cecb48a93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bitbionic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
