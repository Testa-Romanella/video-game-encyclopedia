Solar Flares are continually firing off,  threatening neighbouring life as a precursor to wholesale doom.<br/></p>\n<p> An alliance of the planet's best and brightest have put into place a decades long international project to block the Solar Flares hoping to contain the inevitable flashpoint and buy our planet enough time to evacuate. Consequently, an infeasibly large Orbiter has been deployed and must shield the solar system from the violent Solar Flares.<br/></p>\n<p>That's just <strong>science.</strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - start game and restart game</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> - Rotates anti-clockwise.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong> - Rotates clockwise.</p>\n<strong>Aim</strong>\n<p>Keep knocking back the solar flares to gain as high a score as possible, but watch out!\u00a0As time goes on and things heat up, you'll soon find that the solar flares are coming faster and faster!
