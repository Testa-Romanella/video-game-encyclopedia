But the interest of mankind in the universe around is eternal and irresistible. So humans enlisted the help of machines. Under human control, robots departed to the stars to explore alien planets, gather resources, and help people in places where they could not reach or survive. That's what our game is about.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You will have to control space rovers of various designs, adapted to climb into the most difficult and inaccessible places. They are due to perform different missions on distant planets with varied natural conditions, as well as on space stations. A rover body is reconfigurable and the wheels can rotate independently so that it can overcome difficult obstacles and even climb the steep walls of wells. On low-gravity asteroids and extended Martian dungeons, you'll also have a high-speed rover-wheel with a jet booster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rovers move in our physical world. Gravity, inertia, traction and adhesion are of utmost importance. A rover usually doesn't move quickly, but it needs to be driven with care and very skillfully to overcome all the formidable obstacles and get to the destination as soon as possible. Over time, the difficulty of the levels increases. Improving your rover control skills is the main challenge in this game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Many challenges await rover pilots. On some planets, there are gravitational anomalies: they form suddenly, and it may happen that the direction of gravity reverses, and part of the route will have to be overcome along the ceiling. A rover could be hit by hot lava or get electrocuted by an alien mechanism, or even come under fire from laser cannons if the security system perceives it as a hostile target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game has a variety of missions: exploration, research, equipment repair, resource gathering, rescue missions, and even racing against the rovers of rival corporations. Missions are combined into a single non-linear plot, the results of missions affect the player's capabilities and events in the future.<br/>So your rovers are preparing to disembark. It will be an exciting and breathtaking journey!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T08:01:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/05072c5d4576e45fbf9646269a77e70b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elk&Stump"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Elk&Stump"], "esrb_rating": null}
