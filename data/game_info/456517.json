Also, death in game helps to complete level, for example you must die on very first level in order to open path to bush with teleport. Again, death is an opportunity. But because the team is 10-13 yo and its our first jam, the game is like it is)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45a2b26159e2498355fa16680197198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["doommot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
