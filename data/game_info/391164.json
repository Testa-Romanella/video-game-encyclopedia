Procjam is a yearly game jam in which you make something that makes something. I made a project called Alea City Two: Artbot Garden in which a group of rabbits riding spider robots generate strange modern sculptures in a procedurally generated museum world. It's pretty weird and I had a ton of fun making it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's made in Unity 2019.2 using C# and a bunch of assets from the asset store, including my procedural level generation tool Strata Easy 2D Level Generator, in this case running in 3D mode. This is a little bit of a silly attempt but I think AI generated art, procedural artistry, machine learning, creative coding and computer generated art are really interesting areas that we're going to see a lot of cool stuff in, both inside video games and out. I am also definitely interested in exploring non roguelike games that use PCG, stuff like No Man's Sky is pretty inspiring in this regard. I think PCG and procedural content is only going to get weirder and more interesting as we go :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/15316cf104e39b5a969b6556a095012e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattmirrorfish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
