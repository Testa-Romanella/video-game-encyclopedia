This game actually started off as a monologue I wrote, which was heavily influenced by the works of the Brazilian existentialist Clarice Lispector. The game maintains Lispector's influence, though the text is somewhat different from the original monologue. If you're interested, you can read an excerpt of the monologue on my wordpress website, which is linked in my profile.</p><p>Thank you for looking at my looking at my game, enjoy!  :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/27944bce6a8266b795c51c6e56ba12a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sundew Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
