This game is going to be\u00a0made in Flash instead of Unity! That's right! I'm bringing back this old game that I had and remastering everything that the game has and adding some more additional features!\r\nUsing Flash in 2022?\r\nYup! Even though <strong>Flash died on January 10, 2021</strong>, <strong>Adobe AIR</strong>\u00a0lets people to convert flash games into executable ones, especially for Mobile and TV games!\r\nWhat's New?\r\nOld characters might be deleted due to lack of activity, respect in rules, or recognition in the Discord server. New characters will be added as well as the character applicants in ManggoLand Revamped!\r\n\n<p>This game has been abandoned/discontinued since its sources were lost. If you want to see the sources of the INDEV release and have Adobe Animate 2022, you can drag the .swf file to your Adobe Animate!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T06:52:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc0309e562017caa26e79cb1113b0463.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Exilation"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
