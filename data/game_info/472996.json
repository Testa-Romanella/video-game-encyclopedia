{"id": 472996, "slug": "battlesheet", "name": "Battlesheet", "name_original": "Battlesheet", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is a little turn-based strategy game about a paperboat battle in open sea. Your objective is to destroy all enemy ships, while keeping your own fleet from being destroyed. The different ships in your fleet have different attributes, such as movement range, attack range, attack power, or the ability to move and attack on the same turn;\u00a0use those in your favour!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Controls (also shown in-game) are quite simple. Use A &amp; D to rotate camera, and your mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Left click on ships and cells to interact. Use Escape or the rudder button to pause the game, and Space Bar or the sandclock button to pass your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Some technical observations about the game</strong>:\u00a0Grid size and ship number are completely customizable. Initial positions are randomized every game so each game is different. AI is the most basic AI ever, due to lack of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Game Design, UI Programming &amp;\u00a0Art:\u00a0\u00c1ngel Puga (https://angelpg77.itch.io/)</li><li>Game Design, UI Programming &amp; Game\u00a0Programming: Pablo Garc\u00eda de los Salmones\u00a0(https://ramidreju.itch.io/)</li><li>Music by:\u00a0Patrick de Arteaga (https://patrickdearteaga.com/)</li><li>SFX made with\u00a0SFXR (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb56039ac13775c2eb7e70f1339bf25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ramidreju", "AngelPG77"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
