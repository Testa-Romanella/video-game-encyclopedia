Unchained is a tower defense action game where you not only set different traps to prevent enemies from destroying your base but also fight them directly.  Unchained is the third installment in the series, that includes Orcs Must Die! and Orcs Must Die! 2.</p>\n<p>The core gameplay in Unchained doesn\u2019t differ from its predecessors, mixing classical tower defense features with elements of a hack and slash game. To buy and upgrade your traps you can use both in-game currency you get from matches and real money.</p>\n<p>However, Unchained introduced two new modes to the franchise. The game puts a heavy focus on cooperative playthrough in its  Survival mode. It doesn\u2019t differ much from the single-player mode, as you need to protect the base from a certain amount of enemy waves. But here you work together with other players and need to unite your actions to be more efficient. Another new mode is Sabotage. Here you compete with the second team, killing enemies. The team that survives the most waves wins; you can prevent your opponents from the victory, summoning monsters and ruining their traps.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2016-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T06:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/968/968df3dbb85d2d7aa96ace33a7b2c9af.jpg", "website": "http://www.orcsmustdie.com", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 1631, "beaten": 51, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 120, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 264, "ratings_count": 203, "suggestions_count": 565, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 203, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Robot Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Robot Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
