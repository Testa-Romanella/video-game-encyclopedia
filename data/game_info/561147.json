However, what he doesn't realize is that if you manage to make it to the safe zones your self-destruct timer gets reset. Work together with your fellow BroBot to extend your life!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong><strong>WASD</strong> to move<br/><strong>ENTER</strong> to switch BroBot<br/><strong>SPACE</strong> to jump<br/><strong>TAB</strong> to switch perspectives<br/><strong>ESCAPE</strong> to enter the main menu</p>\n<p>This game includes multiple different obstacles for the BroBots to overcome:</p>\n<p>Disappearing tiles (Red) \u2013 These tiles disappear as soon as one robot steps off them. A rule of thumb is to only allow one robot to use it \u2013 find another route for your second robot!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bounce Pads (Turquoise) \u2013 These engineered jump pads allow the robots to launch themselves two times higher than usual. Use them to get to hard-to-reach places!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Safe Zone Activator\u00a0Pads (Yellow) \u2013 Each level has an exit that is only activated when the Activator pad is found and jumped on.</p>\n<p>Safe Zones (White) \u2013 these are hidden until the Activator pad is found. Reach this with both of your robots to extend your self-destruction timer!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Platforms that are too high may need you to jump on your BroBots head. Sometimes with some quick hands, you can even give your BroBot an extra boost by jumping while they're on your head, switching BroBot, and then jumping again.<br/></p>\n<p>Dr Boffin protected their workshop with a number of security measures. Watch out for pushers and fans! These will knock you off your feet and slow you down, bringing your timer closer to zero.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEVELOPING TEAM</strong><br/><strong>Melon Dog</strong> - Programmer/Sound Effects<br/><strong>CrunchyHuman</strong> - Programmer/UI<br/><strong>Ashtito</strong> - 3d Modeler/Level Design<br/><br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdcab181d5c0c351f97d17a319bb9147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CrunchyHuman", "Melon Dog", "Ashtito"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
