The issue is the fire can fade out if you let temperature too low or burst in flames if you overheat it too much</p>\n<p>You have a deck of cards that can increase or decrease furnace temperature</p>\n<p>In addition, there are some special cards to help or sabotage your goal</p>\n<p>The catch is you have a limited hand of four cards. If your hand is full and you have to draw a card, too bad. This card will be sent straight to the furnace. This card can be the last card you'll draw</p>\n</em>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>You can spend 100 score points to draw + or - card with random amount. You can use this mechanic to get out of difficult situation</p>\n<p>But this ability has a cooldown, so you can't spam it to hel</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple cards to draw:</p>\n<p>- The most basic card - \"give me points\" card. Just increases your score</p>\n<p>- Plain plus or minus temperature with various values</p>\n<p>- Double or half your current temperature. Be careful - your thermometer shows values from 300 to 1000. Plan these cards carefully to not over\\underheat your furnace</p>\n<p>- Burn one card will burn the most left card you have in your hand without triggering the effect </p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/>- Burn all the cards will burn the whole hand, again, without triggering the effect </p>\n\n<p>- And last but not the least the SWAP card. It will swap effects of all other cards (except points card). <br/></p>\n<p>This card will:</p>\n<p>*\u00a0 Swap + to -<br/></p>\n<p>*\u00a0 Swap double to half</p>\n<p>*\u00a0 Swap burn one card to burn all the cards <br/></p>\n<p>* And reverse!<em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Drag cards into the furnace to burn them</p>\n<p>- Press buttons under the score to buy + or - card</p>\n<p>- Or simply let the luck decide your fate and do nothing. Cards will automatically burn in the furnace. But this can easily be your death</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/2577d92dc7964caf53f45c3bdd903d28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FloppyD", "LiquiQ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
