This can trigger epileptic\u00a0seizures, and makes you motion sick.</p>\n<p>This warning is NOT a joke.</p>\n<p>If you play the game and begin to feel bad, then press the escape key to quit the game.</p>\n\n<p><em>GOOOOOOD luck and hope I hope you will have\u00a0fun trying the game</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:10:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e05a144f09ee43e2ea5aadf820aa1f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JK5000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
