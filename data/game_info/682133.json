This is not just essential to have a better game/ toy, but also a better and organic development process. The designer should take a playful position towards her own game, so she can explore its emergent/ inherent possibilities through wild experimentation.\u00a0Unfortunately that\u2019s easier said than done. ...\" -\u00a0https://gamedesignue.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p>Is a blender a toy?
