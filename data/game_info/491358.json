{"id": 491358, "slug": "miniturn", "name": "MiniTurn", "name_original": "MiniTurn", "description": "MiniTurn is a turn based 1v1 multiplayer strategy game.<br/>It can be played competitively or just for fun on a casual basis.<br/>It is a card game that has its own twist. Your health is your money.<br/>You play on a small 16x16 grid map and after you played a card in the game<br/>you have control over the unit and you can direct their fate or lead them into battle.<br/><br/>A match of MiniTurn is usually won by one side when the enemy's Crystal has been<br/>destroyed.<br/><br/>Due to a small player base we can't guarantee that there is another player in the queue at<br/>all times, so we recommend joining our official MiniTurn Discord server to find someone<br/>to play with. (You can find a discord invite on our website)<br/><br/>Good luck and have fun playing,<br/>Max Coppen and Christopher Freund", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T02:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb53f803c4e3e2ee028db74f562e3daa.jpg", "website": "http://miniturn.coppen.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher & Max"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Christopher & Max"], "esrb_rating": null}
