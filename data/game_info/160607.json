I forget the exact theme I was given but it ended up being about a manta ray (Ray Collins) saving female manta rays from the four aquariums that actually have manta rays in captivity. The damsel in distress gimmick is pretty meh but manta rays are awesome. This game obviously isn't finished and only the Bahamas level really works. However, the squirt mechanic and boss fight included in the game worked pretty well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/37312b7c5749bb55fb81222395d932ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Love"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
