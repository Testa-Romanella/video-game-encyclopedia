Our theme was \"hippy love\" and the game we decided to make with it was a something similar to <em>Oregon Trail</em>. The game is rather incomplete and I hope to get it to a more finished state, but as of now you can buy goods before you begin your journey, access most of the menus, play the berry picker minigame for food, and click the flowers to see some of the different endings.</p>\n\n<p>**note that playing in browser can break when going past the shop screen for some reason</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/1288a79d932969e71ae90f97d669bcab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Chris Thorsen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
