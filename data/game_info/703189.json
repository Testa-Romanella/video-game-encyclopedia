I have uploaded a new executable package with the fixes and have kept the broken version as evidence of my compliance with the submission time. DO NOT PLAY THE BROKENDLL VERSION</p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p>Set in a not-so-distant future, hitman and headhunter <em>Daddy Long Legs</em> has a big and new contract to complete. Battle through waves of mutant bug-thugs, break into the target's lair, and kill him to complete your current\u00a0mission.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\n\r\nImportant Items\r\n\r\nTips &amp; Useful Info<p>- This project is low poly but has many textures and lighting effects in place. That being said, there may be noticable FPS lags when playing on lower-end machines.</p>\n<p>- Health and ammo crates are sparse and do NOT respawn.\u00a0Try to properly manage your resources throughout the mission.</p>\n<p>- Headshots do double damage to all enemies. Better accuracy = more reserve ammo.</p>\n<p>- I never really implemented a proper death screen, so if you got booted back to the main menu....\u00a0you died, homie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573a8c524537e65137b87e8994e5508a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FaceplantPhilip"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
