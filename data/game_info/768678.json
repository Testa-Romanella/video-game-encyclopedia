The game idea came to us while participating in the \"Floppy Disk Game Jam\".<br/><br/>You have to try to get out of the maze and not get lost in the depths of your office.<br/><br/><br/>Because of a lack of time we are not able to provide a Windows version. Therefor there is only a Linux version that requires GLEW, OpenAL, SDL2 and SDL2_ttf.<br/><br/>The game is played by using WASD and the mouse for movement with left click for opening doors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game for the game jam was developed by T3V and AngeTheGreat in C++.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf3a2d9cd1089dcf4522db189b93ad0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["T3V"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
