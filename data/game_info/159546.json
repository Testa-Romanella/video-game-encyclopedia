Unfortunately the priority of remaking the game is low as I made it in Game Maker Studio and would have to remake it all and relearn its coding language as I have moved to Unity. Regardless, I felt that the demo is still quite fun despite it being really short.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3 known bugs:</p>\n<p>- jumping on loading token when not advanced past title screen will soft lock game. If you do that, just restart the game and dont do it again ;)</p>\n<p>- level 5 may have some issues the first time. A restart will solve this issue</p>\n<p>- level 9 is, for some reason, dodgy... You will have to have john stand on george and jump up to the exit to advance</p>\n<p>Would love to fix these bugs but no game files lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0811e34f94f37265af29b5b02c10b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["speng"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
