Be careful though, as Ironmouse isn't alone in this place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is free, given that it's a fangame. Donations are open only for those who wish to support my endeavors as an aspiring developer. Any donations you provide I will dedicate to studying game development and perfecting my craft or creation of game assets\u00a0to make even better games going forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs you find so that I may fix them, sorry, didn't have a lot of play testers.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>v.1.01</p>\n<p>- Increased final boss health</p>\n<p>- Final boss cannot be staggered with Quickslash anymore but takes more damage from it</p>\n<p>- Reduced final boss\u00a0stagger chance from fireball</p>\n<p>- Slightly increased final boss damage</p>\n<p>- Updated Quickslash hit detection</p>\n<p>- Updated collision on a few objects</p>\n<p>- Updated AI navigation on West Wing Corridor</p>\n<p>- Controls menu can now be accessed when game is paused</p>\n<p>- Known bug:\u00a0Items respawn if you quit the game or it crashes.
