Even though camera is 3D and first-person, the action is turn-based, where clicking a button counts as an action after which all the creatures will have their turn.</p>\n<p>Like with most LD Jam entries, don't expect a polished game, this is a concept demo made in 4 days.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a leveling system and three lines of perks to boost.</p>\n<p>Three possible endings (without counting alt+F4):</p>\n<ul><li>Out of power</li><li>Hull crushed</li><li>Finding treasure coordinates and getting out of the trench</li></ul>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/>All the controls are presented as buttons inside vehicle interior.<br/>Press [Space] if you want to skip turn.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Getting below creatures will get you entangled by them</li><li>Turning on the lights while next to a creature may get it shocked</li><li>You can use sonar to track locations of creatures around you. The treasure is not visible on sonar though.\u00a0</li><li>Having lights and sonar turned on spends extra power per round. Perks can reduce that wastage.</li><li>The treasure is somewhere below depth level 35, visible in distance as a faint glow on dark background. Visibility depends on the distance and Used to Darkness skill level.</li></ul>\n<p>Apart from clicking buttons in the vehicle interior, you can also use numpad keys to traverse: 8(North), 2(South), 6(East), 4(West), Numpad Plus (go up), Numpad Enter (go down)</p>\n<p>Game made in 4 days as a Jam entry for Ludum Dare 39</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/deep-raider<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0https://ldjam.com/users/kr4ft3r/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Recommended download:</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Raider for Windows (Postcompo -LATEST)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Original compo download: (better don't download that one, it features attrocious story mode)</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Raider LD39Jam for Windows LDJam.rar</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Deep Raider LD39Jam for Mac.app.zip</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/892/8924561d9d29cadbb5d26bb755d1019e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Krafter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
