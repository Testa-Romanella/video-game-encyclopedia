This game originally was a way to challenge myself as I do these kind of things from time to time. It is a classical meteor shooter purely made in CLI C++. The game is in its early stages and I plan to implement more features in the future (not sure when). I listed them in-game in the section \"Dev notes\". The gameplay is very simple. You move in a horizontal line and shoot lasers to destroy the upcoming wave of meteors. The music is done by Eric Skiff who kindly let's his music to be used by the public. I hope you enjoy it and would love to hear both negative and positive reviews!
