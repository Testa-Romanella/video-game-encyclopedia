We made almost all of the assets, Milo\u00a0made the icons and Wade made the characters and animations. Wade did work on the building scene while Milo did work on the main gameplay and game logic. This is supposed to be a quick auto tower defense game where the player can sit back and watch their minions defeat the so-called \"heroic\" adventurers that invade your dungeon. You can change the enemies in the rooms, upgrade the dungeon, and watch adventurers fall to your minions.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The build of the game is an android APK. I don't personally own an android so I don't know if the APK works, let me know if not and I'll look to fix it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is a link to a gameplay video on my youtube:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lore:</p>\n<p>Greetings! Are you a Lich, Dragon, or Demon Lord wanting to earn some <strong>MONEY</strong> on the side? Consider investing in one of our dungeons! We\u2019ll supply you with a space to call your own and enough <strong>GOLD</strong> to get started defending your home and to attract adventurers! <strong>EARN GOLD</strong>, <strong>COLLECT SOULS</strong>, and save up enough to improve your dungeon with us taking only a fraction(10%) of your profits!
