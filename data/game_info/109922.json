Do you STILL think it'd be better if they were 2 young college students out to fight crime while trying to date each other? Well do I have a second solution to your still very specific taste!</p>\n<p>Claire Chase is a student at Granfors University, a lead institution on criminial science related courses. It's been a week since she met Laura, her dream girl, and she still hasn't mustered the courage to talk to her again. But one fateful meeting will put her flirting (and crime solving) skills to the test once again!</p>\n<p>This game is a sequel to my first ever VN, Claire Chase: Love\u26a1Struck!! It can be played independently, but it'll be much more enjoyable (and much less spoilery) to play Love<strong>\u26a1</strong>Struck first.</p>\n<p>Support me on Patreon if you like my work!!<br/></p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Gals being more than pals ( Even more )</li><li>TWO sides of murder mystery</li><li>Investigation / Deduction based gameplay</li><li>Romance based gameplay</li><li>Multiple endings!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Demo Updates:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>25/6/18: Added Case 1 teaser, upgraded graphics</li><li>22/2/18:\u00a0Added\u00a04\u00a0new\u00a0CG\u00a0variations</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d5682bb4afa3ff8ea56c0e5fc3399acf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MONO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
