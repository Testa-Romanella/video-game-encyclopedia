Michael had just moved into his neighborhood and wanted somebody to talk to. In a short, strange course of events, they met on a rooftop and talked for a little while. Emmett soon grew attached to the complete stranger, opening up and may have even considered him a friend. However, the summer friendship ended when Michael moved away, but left Emmett with a problem he realized he could overcome.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe dreamlike memory of the boy became so blurred to him, that when the same boy transfers into his homeroom sophomore year, he doesn't recognize him at first!\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThey rekindle their friendship, which they quickly become close friends\u2026to something a little more than friends. Emmett feels content with the way things have gone for them, but he can't ignore the strange feeling that something isn't right with Michael. There are things he doesn't know about Michael, even coming so far in their relationship, that he can't figure out so easily. What isn't Michael telling him?\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>\r\n\t\u2192 For ages 16 and over \u2190 <br/>\r\n\t\u2192 3 different endings \u2190 \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\u2192 About 3-6 hours in game length (per one playthrough) \u2190 \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\u2192 50+ event images \u2190 \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t\u2192 CG gallery and music room \u2190 </strong></p>\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOverall\r\nthe story was really sweet but also substantial. I felt that I really\r\ncame to know the characters by the end. Obviously lots of love was\r\nput into all the characters, not just the two main boys. The heavy\r\nsubjects were dealt with sensitively but not in a Very Special\r\nEpisode kind of way, they just felt like real stuff that happens to\r\nreal people.\" <em>-\r\nxiaomao @ LemmaSoft</em><br/><br/>\u201cWhat\r\na WONDERFUL, truly groundbreaking visual novel. It touched on so many\r\nbig issues that most VN's don't tackle, and it did it well. It was\r\ntotally realistic and believable. They were two likable, flawed, and\r\nreally human characters that pulled you into the story. The plots and\r\ndialogue all rang true and went beyond the superficial to get at the\r\nreal heart of many issues that teenagers, and maybe people in\r\ngeneral, face.\" <em>-\r\nDawnfire @ LemmaSoft</em><br/>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Story and art by:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tBoniae</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Music credits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Bj\u00f6rn &amp; Gorden, </strong><strong>Discount Fireworks, </strong><strong>Podington Bear, </strong><strong>Kakurenbo, </strong><strong>Biggyzoom, </strong><strong>Blear Moon, </strong><strong>Electric Holiday Orchestra, </strong><strong>Superpoze, </strong><strong>Andrea Carri and </strong><strong>Jahzzar.</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Background photos:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tMorgue File, Stock.xchng, Katherine Sparrow, SusanTheCat @ lemmasoft and Deekay @ lemmasoft.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Proofreaders/Beta testers:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tCam, Euphorics, Himi, Twinkletoes21, Stripesoflove, Mishaa, Moya, Nick, Elaina, and Daija.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Percent complete script:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tBluescorpion @ lemmasoft.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhew, it's been a long time, but I'm pleased to say that Forget-Me-Not is complete and released to the public!</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI want to than everyone for their abundance of critique, love, and support over the years and it means so much! This project has really come a long way and I'm happy to finally see it released. Even though this isn't groundbreaking or anything, not only did I learn a LOT while making this VN, I also had a lot of fun seeing it reach the end of it's release. In the future, I hope to improve in any other works I decide to create. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>BE WARNED,</strong> there are some things in this game that may not be suitable for everyone!!! Though there is no visually explicit or detailed scenes, there are some parts of the game where certain sensitive subjects are addressed.</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(ie: drugs, violence, depression, and mentioning of sexual abuse.)</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you are unsure about having to read something about that, please don't force yourself to play this game.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are three scenes with a flashing effect that's a little bit straining. If you're worried about that, please ask me to upload a separate file without the flashing effect, I'll be glad to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tTo anyone who ends up playing this, I really hope you enjoy it, I've put in a lot of effort and will be grateful for any kind of feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/603/603f0277ce05cc6543c17a96478795ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["boniae"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
