Destroy the core and free yourself from the humans!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for Ludum Dare 49 in 48 hours with the theme of \"Unstable\"</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD to move Left Mouse Click to attack\r\n</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>The core is behind the purple door. To open the door you need to get 3 keys from 3 person.\r\n</li><li>In the unstable phase, you can attack enemies. You\u2019re immune to enemy attacks but each hit from the enemy reduces your unstable duration.\r\n</li><li>In the stable phase, you can die with 10 hits. But enemies won\u2019t attack you unless they saw your unstable phase. You can\u2019t attack in the stable phase but you can blend in.\r\n</li><li>The game gets difficult as time moves on so don\u2019t wait too long!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>I really wanted to add sounds to the game but run out of time. Maybe I\u2019ll make an after-jam update.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01d3279beaf2498a0b974b8eab4f117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wolderado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
