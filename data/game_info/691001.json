I have created a Motor Imagery Training the pinky and visualization screens for: Real-Time Brainwave EEG Data, Motor Imagery Training and Confidence.

They get real-time feedback on being more calm and focus and this is timeline calendar graphed like Github. I have also connected the Spotify API and can do Peak\u00a0Performance\u00a0and PTSD training where the brainwaves are recorded and analyzed in Real-time and that feeds to the Spotify recommendation system to feed music that will make them feel better and perform better.\u00a0\u00a0Additional future components will build on this for All branches of Armed forces including Space Force and Veterans, et al.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team Credits Co -Creators Developers</p>\n<p>Kendra Kennedy and Cliff Baldridge</p>\n<p>Concept: Cliff Baldridge<br/></p>\n<p>Kendra's Role</p>\n<p>Software Engineering and Development, Troubleshooting, Unity, SDK Integration,\u00a0 VR Developer, Interactions Engineer, UI Design Animation Particle\u00a0Physics\u00a0and Level builder.</p>\n<p>Cliff's Role<br/><br/>Project Manager, 3D Content, Execution on\u00a0EEG Devices Successfully.\u00a0<br/>Software Engineering and Development, Troubleshooting, Unity, SDK Integration<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaad8bcab6b8f751e1a9de9ed0fd433e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cliffmagicverse"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
