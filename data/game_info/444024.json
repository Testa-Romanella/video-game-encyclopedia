You have to make your way to the top floor (each room is a teensy bit like an escape room with you having to figure out how to get to the next room - but don't worry, you don't have to pick up or combine items or anything like that - there is no gameplay other than just making choices). And of course there is also a central story that takes the foreground as you progress and realize that you are essentially trapped in the house, so you have to figure out a way to leave and in doing so you discover your character's background and who he is and what his past is and the reason why he is trapped in the house in the first place.</p>\n<p>The game is obviously inspired by me being in lock down </p>\n<p>And also me having had Coronavirus symptoms - so that lead me to reflect on my life and a lot of existential questions - which then lead to me writing this story.</p>\n<p>The game is about 40% done, but those 40% you can already play/read. <br/></p>\n<p>It runs directly in the browser, so you can play it right here, or on my website: http://visual-novel.de/darkness.html<br/> Please give me some feedback and tell me about any errors or problems you encounter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T06:35:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51db1a4b07816218d2099aee04d8a879.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emmanuel Goldstein"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
