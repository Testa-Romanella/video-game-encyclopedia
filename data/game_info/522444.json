The end result is a deep core mechanic and\u00a0the biggest game we have done so far.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls on a Controller:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left stick to move<br/>Right stick to aim<br/>Right trigger to place blade<br/>X/Square button to jump in the air and brake while airborne<br/></p>\n<p>We recommend playing with a controller if possible.<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls on a Keyboard:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/>Up, Down, Left &amp; Right to aim<br/>Spacebar to place blade, jump and brake<br/></p>\n<p>Knowing that, let's move on to...<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a rough explanation of how to play, the game is of course best understood while playing.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>When you aim with the right stick, the crosshair appears. </li><li>The blade appears\u00a0 on top of the crosshair.\u00a0 </li><li>As soon as the blade is placed in the ground its gravity starts to pull you in.</li><li>You can pick the sword back\u00a0up\u00a0 by\u00a0running into it. </li><li>When you jump into the air you get pulled towards the sword faster, because there is less friction than on the floor. </li><li>While airborne you can still control your character, this also allows\u00a0 you to avoid the sword and move\u00a0 about within it's gravitational range.\u00a0</li><li>Flying around the sword you can choose where you want to land.</li><li>If you brake in the air you will slide a bit across the floor depending on your speed in the air.</li><li>To attack an enemy you have to fly into the sword to pick it up and with the remaining speed, hit an enemy. </li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Fabi, Leon &amp; Simon: <br/>GAME DESIGN</p>\n<p>Fabi: <br/>PROGRAMMING</p>\n<p>Leon: <br/>MUSIC, SFX, ART</p>\n<p>Simon: <br/>ART &amp; ANIMATION</p>\n\n<p>And a huge  thanks to the amazing developers behind the Godot Engine and the lovely Godot community who made this possible in the first place!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4aedb73a8f6d39a8da79b4b47fada5f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["adrianbelmont"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
