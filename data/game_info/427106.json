{"id": 427106, "slug": "ctrlaltreset", "name": "ctrl+alt+reset", "name_original": "ctrl+alt+reset", "description": "<p>\"<strong>Ctrl+Alt+Reset</strong>\" is a 2d platform game with levels of increasing difficulty. The main character is a microchip able to re-set a circuit that shorted out. In order to make the circuit work again our hero needs to reach the motherboard through a world of electrical components.<br/>The chance to finish each game level is limited by the frame itself whose horizontal borders get narrow and narrow. The horizontal shrinking towards the center of frame can be reset using a key combination, shown on top-left, which is generated each 5 seconds.<br/>As the right key strokes are pressed the frame restores its borders, but once the reset has occurred the horizontal edges begin to run twice as fast towards the frame center, decreasing the time left to complete the level.<br/>Borders not only mask the game area but are also elements the character can play with as they can be platforms. During gameplay other electrical components populate the screen and will pop up to help you score or alternatively hamper the run towards the goal. Be careful not to be smashed out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>- ARROW KEYS to move the character.<br/>- Press the combination on the top-left for reset the press.<br/>- 1 reset level.<br/>- 2 mute.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>I made everything from scratch for this jam.<br/>Sound effects made with Bfxr and freesound.org.<br/>Background music by Playonloop.</p>\n<p>It was my first game I have ever created.<br/>A game made by Riccardo Todaro.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92bbe35e08d56864b98cdb5b8c212053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grtodaro"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
