VR", "description": "\u201cHELLO PUPPETS!\u201d is a horror-comedy adventure that turns your hand into a living, talking puppet named Scout. Years ago, a bad Sesame Street knock-off called \u201cMortimer\u2019s Handeemen\u201d was canceled and forgotten, but the puppets from the show have come to life, they\u2019re pure evil, and they have plans for you. Your only chance of escape is the somewhat-less-evil Scout. Work with Scout to escape the evil Handeemen puppets before it\u2019s too late!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1986, a fire destroyed the studio where \u201cMortimer\u2019s Handeemen,\u201d a failing children\u2019s show starring hand puppets, was filmed. Eight people died, including the show\u2019s creator. Ever since, rumors have swirled that the burnt-out shell of a warehouse was haunted. You play as a college reporter who broke in to see if the rumors were true. You\u2019re about to get more than you bargained for. <br/><br/><br/><br/>\u201cHello Puppets!\u201d is an immersive VR horror game with a twist: stuck on one of your hands is a sarcastic, foul-mouthed sentient puppet named Scout. Scout isn\u2019t your usual companion character: she doesn\u2019t like you and you don\u2019t like her, but you\u2019ll have to work together to escape the evil cast of \u201cMortimer\u2019s Handeemen,\u201d brought to life by a magical spell gone wrong. You\u2019re on the run from psychotic puppets, and your only friend is a puppet who is, by her own account, \u201cslightly less evil.\u201d <br/><br/><h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Unique horror-meets-comedy tone. Quirky characters and Scout\u2019s foul-mouthed sarcasm will put a smile on your face, right before an evil puppet jumps out of the dark at you and turns it into a scream! <br/></li><li>Scout is more than a bland companion character, she\u2019s alive, and you can interact with her using revolutionary mechanics only possible in VR.
