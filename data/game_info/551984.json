The more pollution there is the less benefits you have. So less pollution = more benefits, and that is how we interpret the theme \"Less is more\".</p>\n\n<p>Development: Bram Ouwerkerk</p>\n<p>Art: Sanzarote\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFh8-zsDmF3auBADVi2Supw</p>\n<p>Sounds: Bram Ouwerkerk</p>\n<p>Music (Not made by us): https://opengameart.org/content/little-people-at-work-loop</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Move Camera with AD or Left and Right Arrow</li><li>Deselect building with the ESC key</li><li>Discover what ores are in the ground with the research truck</li><li>ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO POWER YOUR BUILDINGS!!! If you have to little energy, your buildings won't generate their resources.</li><li>Build Mines above metal, gold and platinum ores to harvest them</li><li>Build Oil drills to dig up oil from oil reserves</li><li>Build Labs to get research points, spend the research points to let your buildings produce their products faster</li><li>Every building generates pollution, at certain quantities (25%, 50% and 75%) you will get a disadvantage (buildings will cost more). If pollution is at 100% you lose.</li><li>Build the rocket once you have enough resources. If you have build the rocket you can play the game further if you want, pollution won't go up after that. To win the game you have to launch the rocket.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:08:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/923/923f300383d67d3b78ca3e9921419293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Batavica Games", "Sanzarote"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
