[fixed]\r\n<p>There seems to be a problem in Yuu's route: when player makes a choice the text box doesn't show even though the game is proceeding. Right now I don't have the solution, but you can still read the text in the text log (you can access it by scrolling up with a mouse or a touchpad during the gameplay) if you're willing.
