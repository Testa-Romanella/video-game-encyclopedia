While playing, you can look up, enjoy your surroundings and give your neck and back a rest from hunching over. Also a great game for the visually impaired.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>- Put in headphones<br/>- Hold your phone flat<br/>- Start walking for a higher score<br/>- Listen and feel phone vibrations for spore clues<br/>- Learn the secret phone gestures for hidden spores<br/><br/>Half of the spores are found by using your phone like a compass, scanning the horizon for clues. The other half require special movements to capture. More text hints are inside the game. <br/><br/>Together, your spores will create one Hybrid Spore that is imprinted with your gameplay: hand motions, speed, accuracy, step count and most importantly, spore totals.<br/><br/>When you create and plant (save) a Hybrid Spore, it joins the global Resonance Scoreboards, showing whose spores have the most total points and who will grow the best Hybrid Plants next year ;)<br/><br/>The Bigger Game:<br/>When planting each spore, you will choose a park for it. You can claim your spores with an email to own them in the next chapters of Hybrid.Games. In time, all spores will evolve into Hybrid Plants, absorbing the real local weather you planted them in.<br/><br/>Stay tuned! New sounds and levels will be added each season. This is an ongoing project by a curious indie programmer/composer/dog-hiker. Being immersed in nature is deeply satisfying to me and I hope this game brings some of that to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T02:08:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/4251ad00e24f0e9fe6cad61a1d57d166.jpg", "website": "http://hybrid.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Scott Standley"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Scott Standley"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
