{"id": 595013, "slug": "match-drop-match", "name": "Match! Drop! Match!", "name_original": "Match! Drop! Match!", "description": "<p>Match tiles to go deeper and find treasure!</p>\n<p>Match! Drop! Match! is an action puzzle game. Try to make it onto the leaderboard!</p>\n<p>)</p>\r\nControls and basic gameplay\r\n<p>Drag the mouse along three tiles with the first and last matching. When you make a match, the middle tile will drop down to the next board, and the first and last tiles will change color.\u00a0(See the gameplay GIF above for some examples)</p>\n<p>Use UP/DOWN, W/S, or the scroll wheel to move up and down between boards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you go to deeper boards, you'll get many more points for making matches.</p>\n<p>Press A to enable accessibility mode (helpful if you have trouble distinguishing the colors).</p>\r\nMore gameplay details\r\n<p>There are two game modes. The main mode is timed - you get 2 minutes to score as many points as possible. There is also an untimed mode if you want a more zen experience (to submit a score in untimed mode, you have to click the \"End Game\" button in the bottom-right).<br/></p>\n<p>Making a match on the top board gives you 1 point, and each board below that is worth 3 times as many points. So making a match on the second board is worth 3 points, the third board is 9 points, the fourth board is 27 points, etc.</p>\n<p>(Note: you definitely don't need to know this to play the game, but we're mentioning it just in case you're interested) When you make a match, the first and last tiles change in a deterministic manner. In particular, if you put the six colors in a \"cycle\" of red-&gt;orange-&gt;yellow-&gt;green-&gt;blue-&gt;purple-&gt;red, the first tile's color will move backwards one in the cycle, and the last tile's color will move forwards one in the cycle.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made with HaxeFlixel.</p>\n<p>Design and programming by Phillip Ai, Colin Lu, Jon Schneider, and Anderson Wang.</p>\n<p>Music by Anderson Wang</p>\n<p>Art by Phillip Ai and Colin Lu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42f/42f4a4ad7a6b1a1e36f90ad364103e50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["amp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
