{"id": 878606, "slug": "project-rift", "name": "Project R.I.F.T.", "name_original": "Project R.I.F.T.", "description": "<p>Project R.I.F.T. is a relatively simple arcade-styled dungeon crawler, where the goal is just to get as many points as possible. Killing enemies and reaching new floors both give points, and on lower floors more enemies will spawn (as well as the ground getting darker). It's an improved version of my old game Alpha Rift, and contains many new features listed below.</p>\r\nNew Features:\r\n<ul><li>NEW DIFFICULTIES: Unlike Alpha Rift, which only contained one difficulty, Project R.I.F.T. now has three. The original \"Normal\" difficulty is accompanied by \"Hard\" and \"Impossible\". As you increase the difficulty, there are more enemies per floor, the maximum HP decreases,\u00a0and the visible area due to the fog of war decreases.<br/>\n</li><li>NEW MAPS: Alongside the original version's level generation, named the \"Tunnel\" generation in the selection menu,\u00a0Project R.I.F.T. also contains two new options, \"Random\" and \"Arena\". The Arena mode uses pre-set maps where only way to clear a floor is to kill all the enemies. Also, all the maps are now 20*30 tiles, rather than Alpha Rift's 18*24<br/>\n</li><li>NEW TUTORIAL: Accessible from the main menu, there is now a full tutorial explaining the movement, scoring, enemies, and generation.</li><li>NEW ARTWORK: The entire game now features artwork, rather than the squares and circles of Alpha Rift.</li><li>NEW MUSIC: The game now has both music and sound effects.</li><li>NEW MINOR CHANGES: There are a few minor adjustments to the fog of war, some enemy interactions, and the game speed.</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>W, A, S, D - Movement within the game and menus. If standing next to an enemy, moving towards them will kill them.\r\n</li><li>SPACE -\u00a0 Select an option in the menus, as well as open the pause menu during gameplay.</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney</li><li>Scribble Dungeons - Kenney</li><li>Spooky Dungeon -\u00a0Memoraphile</li><li>Damage - Raclure</li><li>Sword - Empire Monkey</li><li>Arrow Impact - Twisted_Euphoria</li><li>Paper Cuts 2 Font - Empire of Dust</li><li>A\u00a0Art Paper Font - wepfont</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T09:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/0715928e420647a08b1c8b4bf2a21ac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
