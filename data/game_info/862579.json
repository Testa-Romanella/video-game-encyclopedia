Play as famous 80s action hero, Goose Willis, in his quest to stop Dr. Vernon Vermin in his track to conquer the world with the help of his evil autonomous army of Robomice. Fend off wave after wave of ruthless machines and progress through the halls of Dr. Vermin's secret underground facility.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WASD or Arrow Keys to move<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hold RMB to activate bullet time</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Press LBM to fire your weapon</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Press SPACE <strong>while </strong>holding a direction key to dash <strong>in </strong>that direction</p>\n<p><strong>Game Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Dash and Bullet Time:</p>\n<p>Goose Willis has two potent abilities in his arsenal. He can quickly dash to change his position, and as a bird with incredible commitment and iron focus, he can slow down time for ten seconds to predict enemies' moves and get out of the toughest of situations. To refill his determination to slow some more, the player will have to finish off enemies with the dash ability. Just deal enough damage to the enemy to trigger their self-destruct sequence, and when you see them blinking, dash into them, destroying them on the spot and refilling that precious determination juice.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Upgrades:</strong></p>\n<p>Scattered throughout Dr. Vermin's secret facility are special weapon components that when picked up*, can modify Goose's favorite weapon. They can increase bullet speed, the number of bullets the weapon can shoot at once, or even change the properties of those bullets. We don\u2019t want to spoil all the fun for you so we won\u2019t say more.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts :</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to weapon components, these modes boost Goose\u2019s performance. From healthy and toxic-looking vitamin shots to winged boots and so on. But choose wisely which one you\u2019ll pick as the rest will perish when you make up your mind.*</p>\n<p><strong>* IMPORTANT INFO</strong></p>\n<p>All upgrades come in pairs of two. One pair of ability boosts and one pair of weapon components. You can only pick one of each pair, and when you do, the other will be destroyed and become unobtainable for the rest of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:08:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/271ab0210ca34d29e6aadfa33737dcef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Shogun", "Dans17"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
