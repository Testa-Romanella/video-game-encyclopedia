Take turns against your opponent <strong>adjusting the board</strong> to your advantage while your army moves forward to eliminate theirs!</p>\n<p><strong>Plan Your Moves</strong><br/>Each turn has two phases: the <strong>Board</strong> and the <strong>Unit Phase</strong>. During the board phase, you can <strong>use your cards</strong> to <strong>change the layout</strong> of the board. However, cards have <strong>different action costs </strong>and you\u00a0only have a <strong>limited number of actions per turn</strong>, so choose wisely!<br/></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the<strong> units</strong> can only<strong> stand and move</strong> on their <strong>matching coloured tiles</strong>! During the <strong>unit phase</strong>, <strong>move your units</strong> around the board and<strong> attack your opponent's units</strong> before they attack yours.</p>\n<p>Play on a\u00a0<strong>5x5 board with 3 units per team</strong> or a\u00a0<strong>7x7 board with 7 units per team</strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play<br/></strong><strong>Click on a card</strong> to <strong>select it</strong> and <strong>click on the board</strong> to <strong>choose the tiles</strong> (<strong>hovering</strong> over the board shows the <strong>card's effect radius/target</strong>).</p>\n<p><strong>Click and hold</strong> onto a unit to <strong>move it</strong>. <strong>Drag and drop</strong> it to an <strong>adjacent spot</strong> to <strong>move</strong> it there or onto an <strong>enemy to attack</strong> it.</p><p>Press\u00a0<strong>Escape\u00a0</strong>to go back to the main menu when in a battle.<br/><br/>This game was made for the <strong>Yogscast Game Jam 2021 </strong>to the theme of <strong>\"Opposites\".<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Developed by Rubber Ducks:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>Daniel MacCormick, \u00a0 Alain Sangalang, \u00a0 Kody Wood, \u00a0 Bo Yu<br/><br/><strong>Additional Credits:</strong></p>\n</strong>\n\n\n<p>Card Shuffle: https://www.soundjay.com/misc/sounds/shuffling-cards-5.mp3<br/>Flip Card: https://freesound.org/people/Splashdust/sounds/84322/ <br/>Deal Card: https://freesound.org/people/BMacZero/sounds/96127/ <br/>Hit: https://opengameart.org/content/punch-slap-n-kick <br/>Angels:\u00a0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSRA3ngRoW8&amp;ab_channel=SoundFX<br/>Moves Tiles: https://orangefreesounds.com/rock-moving-sound-effect/ The sound effect is permitted for non-commercial use under license \u201cAttribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)\u201d <br/>Light BGM: https://opengameart.org/content/walking-with-poseidon <br/>Potential BGM: https://opengameart.org/content/the-battle <br/>Hover over card: https://opengameart.org/content/bubbles-pop <br/>Selecting card: https://opengameart.org/content/click <br/>Playing card: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/whoosh-and-s... <br/>Change Tiles: https://freesound.org/people/Speedenza/sounds/167929/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c29ef8f3e0536ff4a16050aa4627fbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rubber Ducks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
