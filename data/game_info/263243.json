I started creating G.I.C. when I noticed the lack of Multiplayer Co-op in Mount&amp;Blade and from there I set out to create a similar game with Multiplayer Co-op support, it has been a long, slow and lonely road. But I finally have a skeleton of the game which is playable, I want to use the game in its current form to source funds to accelerate development and hire some artists to help me create new and better graphics for the G.I.C.</p>\n<p>In its current form the game finally has the needed bare bones systems in place - and these systems will be expanded and improved upon in the future, with new systems also in the works like modding support w/ lua.</p>\n<p>You will also receive a key for steam once the game is listed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12cc45901b6b1d00b0b227f0d840eba5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["104105"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
