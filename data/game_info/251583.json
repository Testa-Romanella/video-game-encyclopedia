The idea is to feel like you are not only in a fight but in a performance.  It's not just fighting to the music, its fighting WITH the music and using it to 'beat' your opponent. In this one-on-one contest of skill, players prove which musician reigns supreme on stage!!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe closer you hit to the beat of the song, the stronger your attacks, blocks, and throws.  Keep up the rhythm and out-maneuver your opponent.  Who ever pleases the crowd and fills the performance meter first wins!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also import your own songs and play to the music.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51a/51af3c88ae03cbc4bbce231e9b546e99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 501, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BYU Animation -  Class of 2018"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Brigham Young University"], "esrb_rating": null}
