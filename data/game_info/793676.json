Even if it didn't, it definitely will one day. Because as an ordinary person, all the decisions that affect your life are made by those who hold power expensive drinking tables. Nothing else remains more than the torture of waking up in the morning to go to work, or the tears you shed to fall asleep at night.<br/>\r\nAgarta is a story written in blood by a serial killer based on this \u201ccry for life\u201d, shaped around our moral judgements and decisions that make us human, and who understands that \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d can only be \u201cgain\u201d in the world we live in.<br/>\r\nCerrah, the serial killer who has committed murders in many countries of the world for thirty years, and whose name or anything else are not known other than the nickname given to him by the media, sought by Interpol with the Red Notice, reappears.
