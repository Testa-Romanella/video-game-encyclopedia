Whilst it is possible to complete, there is a bug which stops you from completing the level if you pick up one the three last keys in \u00a0the wrong order. There is a level select feature in place, if you \u00a0have any issues., you can skip to level 3 and 4 (they are much easier and use other mechanics) :)</p>\n\n<p>(Use ASDW for movement and ARROW KEYS for shooting (when possible) )</p>\n<p>Hold still to heal you'll need certain values of health for some doors</p>\n<p>Red numbered doors are dependent on health\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yellow numbered door require keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4310b035c722098d33754ef67c380dd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ODD_OLIVER"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
