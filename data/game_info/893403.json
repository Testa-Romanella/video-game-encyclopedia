Plot\u00a0and weapons aren't carried over from one map to another and author of each\u00a0map decides with what weapons you start the map. Maps being in 1 continuity\u00a0means that you can play all those maps without being brought back to main menuafter each map. All maps are unlocked in level selection menu so you can choose\u00a0to play any map that you want at any time. There are 3 maps in this mappack that\u00a0have around 1 hour of playtime in total. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> : Due to low number of maps they won't be put into 1 continuity so each time you finish a map you'll\u00a0have to choose another map from main menu</p>\r\nList of participants (not a ranking)\r\n<p>1.
