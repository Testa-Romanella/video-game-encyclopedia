There are only three test cards and duplicates in this prototype.</p>\n<p>On the bottom part you have your hand.\u00a0You can see your cards better by dragging them on top of the \"stats\" part of the screen. On the left side of the screen (in lighter gray), you can drag cards to make a set and attack, costs will be shown on you stats.</p>\n<p>Tell me what you think of the concept in the comments, if you encounter problems, signal them too. Remember that this is a prototype and everything can change. I'm actually going to rewrite it in C++, since Python was mainly used for putting a prototype together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T07:13:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b2/0b20cb59ce3f50a5db93607fd8de003e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geek_Joystick"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
