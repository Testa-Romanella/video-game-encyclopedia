Multiple characters with unique spells, power-ups scattered through the map, and meteors falling from the sky all on a floating island allow for an interesting and wacky match every time.</p>\n<p>This game was made as a school capstone project for game development at UMBC. I worked as a programmer/lead designer in a team of five members, including both senior level programmers and artists at UMBC. The project lasted over the course of one semester, starting from game pitches to prototypes to the final project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01bc1e8694c6ddc4e061b127241f09d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flamboozle"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
