It is an updated version of 1997's Mortal Kombat 4 and was the first game to appear on a sixth-generation platform as well as the only Mortal Kombat game to be released for the Dreamcast console. Critical reaction was mostly average due to the graphics being inferior to the arcade version, the weapons deemed boring or useless, and game-breaking bugs and glitches.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-30T02:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa4f6ebd5a2672ddfa3704b0fa04b8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 9, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Eurocom"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
