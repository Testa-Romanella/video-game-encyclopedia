The character walks through a part of the forest, owned by her family, in Midorigahara, while narrating the story of a Buddhist monastery in the same forest, owned by her grandfather, but resided by an unseen evil force. The narrator says that whatever haunts the monastery has been there for a long time, but she's not done yet!</p>\n<p>Additional Note:</p>\n<p>All the assets used in the game, except the buddhist monastery pack and horror engine, are from another ongoing Cava Games project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was developed by one person in a time of mere 4 days (I was living under a rock and I found out that the Jam started 2 days after it started)</p>\n<p>This game may have a lot of bugs and glitches, because it was made on a Laptop which isn't even considered a gaming laptop, and literally has a 940MX as GPU, and I also had Unreal crash on me several times while making this game. So, I apologize for that. <br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to add a longer story, but my laptop was barely holding it together while working on this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Voice Acting was done by my girlfriend who lives 7000+ miles away, so we had to use instagram to record and transfer the dialogues, so we're sorry about any glitches with the Dialogue system in the game.</p>\n<p>System Requirements:</p>\n<p>Well.. anything better than my laptop..\u00a0</p>\n<p>My Laptop's specs are:</p>\n<p>i5 @2.50gHZ</p>\n<p>940MX 4gb\u00a0</p>\n<p>16gb RAM</p>\n<p>If you have a GPU better than mine, you're good to go:)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement: W,A,S,D</p>\n<p>Camera (look): Mouse</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I tried to deliver some good visuals, and I know I can, but I'm limited by my hardware, I apologize for that.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92dcf6620f17ba48b6754ef433ec834b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CavaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
