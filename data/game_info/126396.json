The monster spawns weakpoints on either side of itself which the player can attack dealing 2 damage (20 total health). The monster will slap itself down on that side of it and a new weakpoint will appear on the other side. While this is happening enemies are also spawning from the other 2 spawn points. This fight ends when the boss is dead and the remaining enemies are killed as well.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29b/29b56f497421136bbe6051d879d9b057.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AllwoodGameDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
