It is made for fans, by fans, with no financial gain whatsoever.<br/><br/>From the very beginning of the project, Sonic 2 HD has focused on maintaining the feel that has made Sonic the Hedgehog 2 a classic while using new tools to reimagine the original as it could have been were it made today. The game\u2019s art direction reflects this, but Sonic 2 HD has also given equal attention to unseen essential elements in the physics and audio. The result of this is an unprecedented re-interpretation in high definition graphics, music and gameplay of Sonic 2, which continues to set quality standards to this day.<br/><br/>We firmly believe 2D artwork is the foundation of Sonic\u2019s retro roots. With this in mind, our goal was to produce a similar shading style to the Japanese original concept artwork and set it in motion with hand-drawn animations. Now, 25 years after Sonic 2\u2019s release, Sonic 2 HD can faithfully represent the original\u2019s cast of characters and environments in a world where technology no longer imposes artistic limitations.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>recommended system requirements</strong>\u00a0to fully enjoy Sonic 2 HD:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>OS Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64bit\r\n</li><li>CPU Intel Core i5 2500\r\n</li><li>GeForce GTX 650 1GB\r\n</li><li>4GB RAM\r\n</li><li>400MB of disk space</li></ul>\n<p>sonic2hd.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed2e6fdc4ada3a77396694afcb53636d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrHoot2000"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
