Kakuro is one of the top logic puzzles worldwide, appearing in printed newspapers, magazines, books, and numerous software implementations for smartphones, tablets and computers.\u00a0<br/><br/>Whether you are new to Kakuro or an experienced player currently using another app, you owe it to yourself to download and try Art of Kakuro. The app was designed to make the experience of playing Kakuro on a mobile device more efficient and enjoyable than anything else available. For example, in other Kakuro apps, adding notes to indicate what digits are possible in a row or column is annoyingly tedious. Art of Kakuro makes this far faster and easier by allowing multiple selections, and by allowing dragging across the number input buttons to enter multiple consecutive digits. As a result, entering notes for a row of three spaces with a sum of 10 takes 2 tap-and-swipe gestures instead of 24 taps. Advantages like these will make other apps seem frustrating once you've used Art of Kakuro!<br/><br/>Art of Kakuro also offers unparalleled choice in gameplay and appearance. There are a number of input control schemes used in various Kakuro apps, but only Art of Kakuro gives YOU the choice, with 11 input control variations available. Options for color scheme, background image and font allow you to find a style that looks good to YOU - and to change it periodically to keep it fresh.
