Up to 72 players can share a server at which they participate in races together. They can also purchase in-game homes, which allow the players to unlock faster cars and driver perks. The drivers are customizable up to their clothing and emotions.</p>\n<h3>Weather and seasons</h3>\n<p>Forza Horizon 4 has a dynamic change of weather and seasons that change on a weekly basis. The weather conditions are synchronized and shared by all players on the same server. The weather and seasons alter the environment and thus the gameplay. Conditions like snow, mud, and ice can influence not only the driving style but also which areas and routes are accessible during which season. Most notably, the players can drive on the ice when lakes and rivers freeze. </p>\n<h3>Cars</h3>\n<p>Forza Horizon 4 features more than 450 vehicles that are licensed by over one hundred car manufacturers. Among the few notable manufacturers that were not included because of licensing problems are Toyota and Lexus.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>Although the game is oriented towards online multiplayer gameplay, it also has a single player and local multiplayer modes. The game also introduces a level editor mode called Route Creator that allows the players to design and customize new routes.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:31:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/786/7863e587bac630de82fca50d799236a9.jpg", "website": "https://forza.net/horizon", "rating": 4.37, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 168, "owned": 3888, "beaten": 598, "toplay": 308, "dropped": 609, "playing": 329}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 357, "ratings_count": 1573, "suggestions_count": 460, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1589, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "Xbox Series S/X"], "developers": ["Playground Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Xbox Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
