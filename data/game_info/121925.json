We were 3 to create the game and we could only spend one week-end. Moreover it is our very first game. So don't expect to download the new best Next-Gen AAA whatever game. Anyways, we hope you'll have some fun trying it.</p><p>Built using Unity 5.1.</p><p>You control a Yoyo moving up and down. The rope you're hanging on is fragile ! If you get hit by flies it will be damaged until it breaks, in which case you lose. Your rope's solidity is represented by its thickness.</p><p>However, super radishes can help you ! Indeed, by catching green radishes you'll restore your rope's structure (You knew that radishes can repair ropes right ?). While catching red radishes will make you invincible for a short while so you can kill those bitches flies without damaging your rope !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7d143128b7dabf913ebd7da8a86494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["piottej"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
