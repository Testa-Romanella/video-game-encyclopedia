The cards used include all ranks from 8 onwards for all suits and the 7 of Hearts and 7 of the Spades. It is a trick-taking game where there are 15 possible tricks. At the start of the first game, it is decided randomly who will select the trump. After the first game, both players alternatively select the trump. In this trump card game player who selects the trump has to make more than 8 tricks to win, while the other player has to make more than 7 tricks to win the game. If the player who selects the trump makes 8 hands, while the other player makes seven hands, then it is a draw.<br/><br/>The first lead is by the player who selects the trump, while subsequent ones are by the one who wins the trick. On each trick, the highest of the led suit wins unless it is trumped.
