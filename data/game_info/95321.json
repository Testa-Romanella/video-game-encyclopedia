Without them kickstarting the project, this would have never launched. Dori is the artist who drew the Ruby &amp; Weiss sprites, AKA one of the pieces of art you'll see for the majority of the game. We're deeply grateful to them for being the one to start this.</p>\n<p>We grew a lot in this period of time, and this project is a labor of love. No money exchanged hands during the development of this game\u2014 only dedication, and what spare time we could offer.</p>\n<p>Thank you, all of you, for your patience over the last four years.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We kept moving forward.\u00a0Thank you, Monty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce5e9b7d47c6ee767cf9d0d8191181d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 420, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Summer Rose Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
