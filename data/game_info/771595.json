In this tower, some rocks falls and some coins too. It's perfect 'cause you love coins. And you love costumes. All you have to do is jump mid-air and bounce against the wall to collect as many coins as you can without being hurt by rocks. But be careful ! If you fall in the lava, you will be cooked to death. And as anyone know, tofus have 3 lives. So use them wisely.</p>\r\nInformation about the game\r\n<p>This game was made using Godot and it's my first one ever :D.</p>\r\nWarning\r\n<p>This game was made for Android and Windows Desktop applications but is playable in the browser (with some lags...
