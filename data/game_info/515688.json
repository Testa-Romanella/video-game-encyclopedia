Well, see, the thing is,\u00a0making a game is actually kinda sorta just a little bit\u00a0hard. So, after far longer than I'm willing to admit, I'm finally ready\u00a0to present my \"results\". This \"game\",\u00a0which is less of a \"game\", and more of an abomination bound together by horrible code, wishful thinking, and luck, is now freely available for anyone anywhere to play. What a terrible, terrible world we live in.</p>\n<p>Why you should download it:</p>\n<ul><li>It's free!</li><li>Twenty (20) whole levels of content!</li><li>It might, according to some definitions of the word, even count as a \"game\"!</li><li>It's kinda annoying!</li><li>Up to 1\u00a0(one) hour of gameplay, or maybe more if you're bad!</li><li>Download numbers going up make me happy!</li><li>It's free!</li></ul>\n<p>But don't just take it from me! See what my playtesters had to say about it:</p>\n<ul><li>\"I give up\" - Jamie</li><li>\"Random Acts of Physics isn\u2019t not a game\" -\u00a0Not Paisley Sears</li><li>\"i won't lie it is extremely frustrating at times\" - Eman</li><li>\"YOu JERk\" - Jamie</li></ul>\n<p>I'd say I\u00a0hope you enjoy, but that would be a lie. Suffer, you foolish mortals, suffer!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8767e1cf2de8dcbf4db0540720f698a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cahatstrophe Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
