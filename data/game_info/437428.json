Our ideals, morals, dispositions, imagination and actions. It is constant exposure throughout the entirety of our lives. All the books we read page by page, films we watch at the edge of our seat and games we play for hours on end. Though there is a darker side to media that is shrouded in taboo and social conditioning though is constantly encroaching in across all mediums. It shapes how we think, act and accept but rarely is spoken about. Here we will have that conversation and explore what exactly is the impact of this taboo medium.<br/></p>\n<p>Through a narrative style conversation with multiple branching paths of inquiry you will delve down this rabbit hole and come back out questioning why exactly we embrace what we do. And more so question its place in our society and how it reflects us as a culture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Play:</p>\n<p>Download the html files and play full screen in your designated browser.
