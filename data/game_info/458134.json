Protect yourself from your enemy's elemental attacks by countering them with the correct elements!</p>\n<p>There are five elements in the game: Fire, Water, Ice, Earth, and Nature; each having their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>A sequence of elements will be displayed on the upper side of the screen. These are your enemy's elements.</li><li>Create your sequence to counter the enemy's. Use the numbers 1 to 5 to place elements.</li><li>Successfully countering an element will damage the enemy. Failing to do so damages you. In case of a draw, usually no one gets damaged.</li><li>You win if the enemy's health reaches zero, you lose if yours do.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>OTHER MECHANICS</strong><br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>The enemy may sometimes place Mirrors or Shadows in their sequence:<ul><li><strong>MIRRORS\u00a0</strong>- Copies the last element you placed.
