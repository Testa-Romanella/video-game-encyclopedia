Kids will create their squads by choosing logos and playing fields and staffing them with fictional Backyard kids and pintsize versions of 30 pro players. They can even create their own characters from scratch and share them with friends&#39; copies of the game via the Game Link cable. Backyard Baseball includes single game, season, and home run derby modes, and also allows kids to play head-to-head against other GBA owners.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-30T07:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf221965d2b9729bd6178123a0180623.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "PC"], "developers": ["Humongous Entertainment"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Humongous Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
