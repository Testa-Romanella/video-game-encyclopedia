{"id": 711412, "slug": "contrary", "name": "Contrary", "name_original": "Contrary", "description": "<p>Contrary is a point-and-click puzzle game where you're abducted by a group of people with a twisted sense of fun. Under the constant look of the cameras, you're put against an opponent you cannot see to complete in three challenges, each hosting three puzzles. Whoever escapes first shall regain their freedom, while the other is left behind, locked in the rooms, forever.</p>\n<p>Time is short and the clock is ticking...<br/><br/>========<br/></p>\n<p>This project has been made for the Secret Santa 2021 jam, but it will be updated in the future to receive new puzzles and a couple more rooms. Also, the next update shall have a \"skip puzzle\" token for that puzzle that keeps resisting.</p>\n<p>This game features auto-save. Every time you enter a new room, your progress is saved. However, if you quit before you go to the next room, you'll lose your progress.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard and mouse (for most of the puzzles). <br/><br/><br/>It's strongly recommended that you have paper and something to write with, since you'll probably want to take notes.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>=======<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>3D Models: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Door pack Aferar by Andrey Ferar - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/door-free-pack-aferar-14...<br/></p>\n<p>-Table by MASH Virtual - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/table-162871<br/><br/>-Samsung Tablet by alextray - https://www.turbosquid.com/es/3d-models/samsung-tab-s-max/864824<br/></p>\n<p>-Too Many Items: Kitchen Props by Q!
