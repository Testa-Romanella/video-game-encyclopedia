That was NOT how this was supposed to go down. But that's what Gabriel Dorleac is known for. Killing the undead. He has been doing so for years, ever since he returned home from Citadale Island.<br/>And now a new shadow cast its darkness over the castle. So of course Gabriel is going to go there. However, he might be in over his head. He may even, gasp, need help?!<br/><br/>As Gabriel Gorleac enter Citadale Castle and rid the lands from the evils of The Shadow Maker in this old-school, top down 2D RPG. Structured like a metroidvania with timer-based turns during combat, this adventure is filled to the brim with the undead, beautiful pixel-art locations to explore and eerie melodies to listen to. Do you have what it takes to end the darkness? I think you do. Maybe.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>A Citadale game unlike any other<br/></li><li>Structured like a metroidvania<br/></li><li>Battles like a JRPG<br/></li><li>Looks like 1996<br/></li><li>Sounds like an epic adventure</li></ul>---------------------------------------------<br/>This game can be played with any controller, keyboard and even with only the mouse.
