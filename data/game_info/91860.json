Finding himself rather helpless and immobile, Randall seeks professional help from a mental hospital, but as there is no space at the time, he is sent to Blur Asylum where he meets two interesting inmates. However, it is possible that he may never be able to check out once committed and death awaits around every corner, or is that love?</p>\n<p>{NOTES: I wrote, drew, edited, and coded everything with the help of Ren'Py.
