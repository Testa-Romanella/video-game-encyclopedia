As a chain mail writer you daily fake your identity in different ways as you try to relieve your evergrowing email list recipients of their money.</p>\n<p>To your help, you have:</p>\n<ul><li>the Dark Web Marketplace to get hold of more email addresses,</li><li>a Scam Tracker to keep track of the spread of your emails,</li><li>a Bank Account to which the scammed can send their money and</li><li>the titular <strong><em>Chain Mail Generator</em></strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>Different emails have different potential for spread and earning you money depending on their contents. Funny messages are spread more easily but they need to be serious to incentivize payment.</p>\n<p>Do not worry too much about that though. Lacking\u00a0quality of your emails can easily be made up for by the sheer quantity of emails that you can produce with your generator.</p>\n<p>Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript\u00a0during Global Game Jam 2018, on the\u00a0LiU Game Jam\u00a0site, based on the theme\u00a0<em>Transmission</em><em>.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<strong>Axel Nordansko</strong><strong>g</strong>authentic Windows XP\u00a0styling<strong>Joakim Nilsson</strong>programming, Twitter integration<strong>Joel Oskarsson</strong>programming, tracking graphs<strong>M\u00e5ns Gezelius</strong>programming, tracking graphs, mail generation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/754/75403d380b5ab6b75c5c8766eb6962d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Axerosh", "Jojoje", "Golen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
