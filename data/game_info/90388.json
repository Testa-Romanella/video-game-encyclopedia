Not happy because of your house, but happy because you are secretly a murderer behind your husbands back.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Your goal is to kill as many people as possible, and hide their bodies around your house. The more people you murder, the less space to hide their floppy corpses. If your husband comes home and finds a dead body, the Jig is up! Enjoy a silly game, with a ridiculous mechanic, but absolutely quality voice acting. Seriously, the budget for this game went 90% towards hiring a professional voice actor.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>W,A,S,D to Move</li><li>Space to Jump</li><li>left Ctrl to crouch</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>E to pickup items and interact with people to let them into your house</li><li>LMB to throw carried items</li><li>Esc to pause</li></ul>\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<ul><li>The Husband only recognises the head of a dead body, so make sure that part is hidden</li><li>You can kill someone by throwing anything at them, or stabbing them with a knife</li><li>If someone gets stuck, just push them around a little bit</li></ul>\n<p>(We are new to Unity, so none of the models or textures were made by us)</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com\u00a0,\u00a0http://www.purple-planet.com</p>\n<p><em>Made in 72 Hours for Ludum Dare 42</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a1d3703d42f6355e037c9e3e2e5eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Incinious"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
