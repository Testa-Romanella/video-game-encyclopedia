This is a small sandbox demo featuring various types of moving/rotating* platforms and some sandbag enemies to mess with! This is more of a \"proof of concept\" demo then anything, but I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Note: The rotating platforms are Barely Functional, I need to work on them more at some point but for now, they just Work (Barely).</p><p>Second Note: The numbers in the top left are the FPS!

Feels better I think.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34e/34e6951cdce4f4866171061a5c926715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rivit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
