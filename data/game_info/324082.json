John is an average person, living an average life, with an average cat. He cooks, goes to work, and sleeps. He cooks, goes to work, and sleeps, He goes to work, pets the cat, and orders takeout because he simply can't be arsed, and oh dear, it's all gotten a little out of hand, hasn't it?</p>\n<p>\"Homeowner\" is a small, humorous game about the trials and tribulations of homeownership, and balancing the competing demands of work, sleep, stress and food. There's also a cat, because every home should have a cat. (Yes, you can pet the cat.)</p>\n<p>This is our game for Global Game Jam 2019. Theme was \"What Home Means To You\", and we chose a very cynical take on that theme drawn from our own experiences. It was written over the course of one weekend, in C on SDL, and the graphics use the default C64 palette, with some modifications for time of day lighting changes. It features four minigames tied together by an overarching resource management / survival sim.</p>\r\nMedia", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/939ad2a111b8e1c054fa5066e04c05a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["birdrun"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
