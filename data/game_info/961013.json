{"id": 961013, "slug": "stack-masters", "name": "Stack Masters", "name_original": "Stack Masters", "description": "Stack Masters is best described as a Competitive Physics Sandbox.<br/><br/>\tStack blocks, make towers, reach the goal zone, beat your friends, success!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>It may sound simple but in practice almost every solution, to every level, is unique and things soon expand into so much more.<br/><br/>Explore a never ending physics sandbox while creating seemingly impossible yet highly personal solutions. Compete against your friends to build the highest towers possible on every level, climb the leaderboards, and blow their minds with screenshots of your crazy creations,<br/><br/><br/>Why is a game that has proved to keep players hooked for hundreds of hours so cheap?<br/><br/>\tA low price was always the plan and that's not going to change no matter how many times we hear it's worth more.<br/><br/>\tWe want you to be able to buy the game whenever you want, without needing to wait for a sale, or to grab a bunch of copies and share them with friends so you can all compete for the top spot on the leaderboards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dev Note:</strong> The game was always intended to be sold at this price point and, to be honest, it's a bit of an experiment. I'm a solo developer that believes that games are becoming far too expensive and I wanted to test if such a low price point would be supported and in turn allow me to continue doing what I love the most: making games that feel great to play. I'm not interested in the money; I'm only interested in being successful enough to make more games that you guys love to play as much as I love to make them.<br/><br/>However you choose to play the game, I just want you to play the game, and I didn't want price to ever be an issue. <br/><br/>Oh, and don't worry, there are no microtransations either.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\tStack Masters can be played entirely with the mouse allowing you to kick back, put your feet up, and chill out to one of the most relaxing games in years. <br/><br/>With over two hours of uniquely chilled yet toe tapping vibes, fade into a blissful state of zen while solving the mysteries of the universe. (Maybe there's a touch of hyperbole going on here, just maybe, but then again.....)<br/><br/><br/>\tNope, far from it. The game is split into loads of different categories each exploring a different game mechanic or theme. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>\tYou'll start with the simplest of towers, but you'll soon be dealing with drop zones, time manipulation, logic puzzles, gravity sliders, multi-zones, pivot blocks, ungrabbable blocks, interlocking blocks, bridges, weights and even a level built to play like a pachinko machine.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\tThere are over one hundred levels already and we've only just begun to scratch the surface of what's possible.<br/><br/>\tBetter yet, everyone can explore those possibilities with an in-game level editor. See below for details.<br/><br/><br/>\tPlay together with children to teach them the basics of physics, or use your engineering degree to push things to the extreme.<br/><br/>\tEvery category contains a selection of levels, from easy to hard, to allow everyone to explore the whole game.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>\tYou'll usually only need to beat one or two levels in each category to unlock the next one, so all players of all skill levels can easily progress through the whole game and explore all the different themes and game mechanics.<br/><br/>\tMost levels are designed to be solvable in anything from five to thirty minutes but if you want to compete for the best possible scores you can expect to spend hours on each level in order to find the ultimate solution. <br/><br/><br/>Each level can have up to three leaderboards, allowing you to compete with your Steam friends or push yourself towards a world record for ultimate glory. <br/><br/><br/>\tEvery level was built using the game's super easy to use level editor. A single click of a button can allow you to begin editing the level you are currently playing or to start a brand new one from scratch. <br/><br/>\tChoose an arena, choose a location, choose from hundreds of block shapes, drag and drop them wherever you like, and start playing your creation instantly right there in the editor. A couple of clicks and you've added a new goal zone. A couple of drags and you resized and moved it to the perfect position.<br/><br/>\tWant a new wall here or there? No problem. Click click. <br/>\tWant a drop zone here, or to change a block to a different type? No problem. Click click. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>\tOnce done, you can share your levels instantly via the Steam Workshop.<br/><br/><br/>Two clicks is all it takes to upload your creations, and one click to download each new community created level you want to play. It couldn't be easier. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Have you got what it takes to become the next Stack Master?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T05:34:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a7168f0b581fc3b19ca24a9111b93027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Intravenous Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Independent"], "esrb_rating": null}
