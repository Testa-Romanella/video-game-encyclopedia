We use blockchain to verify true ownership of the game\u2019s virtual properties/assets, enabling a Monopoly-like game where players can buy/sell/rent properties, play in-game mini-games, etc in a virtual world.</p>\n<p>$MPLY is the utility token for this game and just like the original board game, $MPLY tokens will be solely used for in-game transactions (including rewards). On top of that, our game requires characters with certain attributes to play with. These characters will be unveiled by us in near future and then they can be minted by the players as NFT for traversing the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de8f8ff0133fb447c0880751a981d59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["monopolynft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
