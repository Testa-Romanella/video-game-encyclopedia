I\u00a0like the idea of home not being a physical place as much as a state of mind where I\u00a0feel comfortable, stable and surrounded by people or things that I\u00a0love.</p>\n<p>This state is in constant flux, but orbits a central core that is me. Sometimes I\u00a0explore physical or mental places that take me away from home and my comfort zone, and I\u00a0can feel lost or far away from home. These experiences add to my core and my home, and become incorporated into me. If I\u00a0explore too much I\u00a0can start to lose sight of myself, but I\u00a0know that my home is always there, and I\u00a0can always take time to return to it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/553e65c64a08f7f7e20589c4373956c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Claire Morley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
