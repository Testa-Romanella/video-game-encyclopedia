An unlikely hero appears in the form of Frederick, a coward who had hid during the fall of Lucitia and whom now feels the need to get revenge.</p>\n<p>Take control of Frederick and his allies and battle to take back the overwhelmed lands to help bring peace back to Lucitia.</p>\n<p><strong>An Adventurer's Legacy</strong> is a tactical turn-based battle system tech demo which I aim to one day turn into a fully fledged TRPG.
