Enemies are only attracted to those of the same type as them. Move around the level to find the enemies. Whenever enemies get together, they each give a heart and will disappear from existence. Watch out! You will have to trigger the enemy to make them follow you, but once they're triggered, they will always chase you while trying to shoot you down. There also traps placed acrross the level that will try to shoot you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming: No whOne</p>\n<p>Art and Animations: Pazzi</p>\n<p>Music: No whOne\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound effects: freesound.org, rsfx.me</p>\n<p>Font: heaval</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T08:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a407a350d0cfcb64b6047d215332d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No whOne"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
