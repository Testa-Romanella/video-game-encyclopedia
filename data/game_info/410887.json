The larger you can make a group before you remove it, the more points you score. Advance to another level by clearing enough tiles on the current board. The higher the level you get to, the more points you can rack up, but the more challenging the board becomes. That simple premise can keep you thoroughly absorbed. <br/><br/>iMaki's tools let you make strategic decisions to keep a game going... as long as you don't use them up too soon or wait too long to use them.<br/><br/>Plus:<br/>\u2022 Customize iMaki's appearance with different display modes and color palettes<br/>\u2022 Use tools to control your fate<br/>\u2022 Earn more tools with good moves<br/>\u2022 Play on iPhone, iPad or iPod touch", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ad59063657cf9cd679d89882a79c574_zFDeYRz.jpg", "website": "http://www.dbandel.com/ios/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dennis Birch"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Dennis Birch"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
