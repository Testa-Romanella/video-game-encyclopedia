If yes \u2014 \u201cMental Hospital\u201d is waiting for you. <br/><br/>The story of Mental Hospital begins with a banal event in the life of a young reporter. Agreed to film a special forces raid tasking at the Psychiatric Hospital, he started his work. But in an absurd accident he has been arrested at the office. In order to get at least something from such a bargain, you (as this reported) still hesitant to go to the hospital, and shoot for the scene at least something meaningful. <br/><br/>Incredibly powerful, creepy atmosphere. It will keep you in suspense, not allowing to relax for a minute.
