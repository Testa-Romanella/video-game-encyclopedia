Where the passage of time has\r\nstarted to make a once prosperous civilisation disappear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PUZZLES:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Explore\r\nruins filled with forgotten puzzles and history, understand these\r\npuzzles in order to solve them and to understand your story and the\r\nhistory of these ruins. Based on logic, these puzzles will allow you\r\nto acquire bas-reliefs in order to restore two parallel Roman stories\r\nand help you make your choice; because this lost universe may not be\r\nwhat you think.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>You\r\nare not naked in this forgotten world. You have a bow, arrows, ropes\r\nand torches to help you move around in this environment. The bow and\r\narrows connected to ropes will allow you to climb higher and higher\r\nand to new areas.

Use them\r\nwisely!</p>\n<p>What\r\nchoices led to these large cities being forgotten?</p>\n<p>Explore\r\nthem to learn more about them, but also about you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reliefs : Early access :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Game\r\ndevelopment is very long and very complicated process, it can last\r\nfrom just a few months to several years. Being the only developer of\r\nthis game is all the more difficult because I don't really get\r\noutsider opinion or critique. Early access is a logical step in order\r\nto make the game accessible to everyone and to be able to correct\r\ndevelopmental mistakes or ideas before the official release of the\r\ngame. Early access allows you to create a community around the game\r\nto help the developer release a fun, finished and playable game.</p>\n<p><strong>What\r\nis the current status of the early access version?</strong></p>\n<p>20%\r\nof the game is available for this moment. You have a tutorial and a\r\npart of the world map that you can explore like you wish. Few of\r\npuzzles are available and many functionalities are not implemented.\r\nThese defects will be corrected thanks to the constant addition of\r\ncontent during early access because I want this game to have great\r\nreplayability.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>System requirements : Minimum :</strong><br/>- OS : Windows, Mac, Linux.<br/>- Processor : Double core.<br/>- Memory : 1GB RAM.<br/>- Graphics : ATI or Nvidia 512MB.<br/>- DirectX : Version 9.0c or better.<br/>- Storage : 2GB available space.<br/>- Sound card : OpenAL comptaible sound card<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>System requirements : Recommended :</strong><br/>- OS : Windows, Mac, Linux.<br/>- Processor : Quad core.<br/>- Memory : 3 GB RAM.<br/>- Graphics : ATI or Nvidia 1GB.<br/>- DirectX : Version 9.0c or better.<br/>- Storage : 2GB available space.<br/>- Sound card : OpenAL comptaible sound card</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecdb5ac0e28461ba9aae3b509be67915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sylvain Abrial"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
