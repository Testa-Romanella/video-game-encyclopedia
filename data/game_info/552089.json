More enemies provide more danger for the player but at the same time give more opportunities to use them for movement.</p>\n<p>I'm very happy with the results, the game is fun to play, but I have a lot of problems with balance in the level design. Until now I don't know if the levels are too easy or hard.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed the game! :)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>---- spoiler alert! ----</p>\n<p>If you have trouble with some level you can use the m key to jump to the next level or use the n key to return to previous level.</p>\n<p>------------------------<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/924/924c65042f5fd2c45baaf72d02214881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Creational Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
