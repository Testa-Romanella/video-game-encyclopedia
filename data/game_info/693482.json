An Arcade Adventure with an immersive plot where investigation is mixed with moments of action, infiltration, stealth, and puzzle solving, whose result I think is dignified and personal.<br/></p>\n<p>Hole City is Irreverent Studios' first project, an adventure game that takes place in a decadent and dehumanized city, fictional ... but sadly not so far from reality, where the citizens are little more than guinea pigs. Can a society be Zombified without even realizing it?</p>\n<p>Take on the role of Detective Dante, investigate, gather evidence, solve puzzles, infiltrate, fight for your life and discover what is behind what seemed like just another routine case in this author's game with an immersive plot.</p>\n<p>I propose an Adventure with a particular graphic aspect, inspired by the aesthetics of Cinema Noir, a game with an interesting and attractive mix of gameplay styles and a seductive narrative approach.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a different game, and you want to immerse yourself in a unique adventure, with your own personal style, put on your headphones, lie down where no one will bother you and immerse yourself in Hole City, a mirror to look at and wonder if we really have control over our lives.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a lover of adventure games, cinema, science fiction, comics, crime fiction ... or enjoy a good story, I am sure you will not be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Sometimes things are not what they seem, a bad decision can have great consequences.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T08:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e306ea2a03ea46538d1ecdc4a2b1a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Irreverent"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
