Team 20 completed this project, and we chose the themes Among the Stars and Stuck in a Loop. Stuck in a loop because the ghost is always moving in the same direction and cannot stop unless she dies, and Among the stars, as the ghost is in space, seeking to reach the next galaxy but it is too far away, she encounters miniature space monsters who try to murder her.\u00a0Sky\u00a0is the name of the ghost because she frequently goes up to the sky..\u00a0(For any problems contact wildanomar51@gmail.com or\u00a0ephy5116@gmail.com)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T09:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7df/7dfe2b712b406f4fb284e1cbc6031070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team20"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
