A camera, heavy, thick, old, weighing down your hand.  And the sound of crying in the distance, growing ever closer<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAshen Will is an atmospheric horror game in which you must traverse a dark, randomly generated maze, taking photos of invisible enemies to grab a precious few seconds before death.  Your only tool for hope is your camera, granting you the ability to freeze enemies in place, and mark corridors you've traveled down.  But film is finite and precious, and even the best run can still end painfully quickly.  We wish you the best of luck...you'll need it", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T07:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4e381005f7d405f56de2a27102ff4d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peppermint Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Peppermint Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
