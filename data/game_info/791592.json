To use the grapple hook use the mouse and right click at a given spot on the rock areas around the player to grapple(note you must hit a physical spot on the rock for the grapple to work. once grapple is enabled the player can use WASD and jump to maneuver with the grapple hook to swing around the obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Questions We would like answered<br/></strong></p>\n<p>1. does the grapple hook have to much force to it? Should it have a cool down on it?</p>\n<p>2. What other forms of obstacles would you like to see as the player attempts to swing out of the volcano?</p>\n<p>3. Currently there is only one speed set on the rising milk lava. We plan to later make it increase in velocity as the game continues. Is the velocity that it is at now to slow/fast for the start of the run?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T18:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc0a25658ca429ea289fef876c10f2ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Ogden"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
