Moving next to a face tile cause that face tile to move with you until you scrape against a wall.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move with arrows. Escape to reset the level.</p>\n<p>Made for the 4th Extra Credits jam. The theme was \"connect\", so I thought up the first idea that takes that literally (connecting tiles on a board) and the first idea that takes it metaphorically in a way the audience for Extra Credits would appreciate (making emotional and social connections).</p>\n<p>If the game doesn't automatically choose a good resolution for you, just close the game and an ini file will appear that can be used to change it.</p>\n<p>Bug warnings: the level select menu doesn't handle wrap moving up correctly. it also might crash.\u00a0 Also the credits menu was a last minute thing, so yeah...</p><p><strong>Bug Update</strong>: It turns out the in-game timer doesn't always activate the updates it's supposed to, so in the levels \"Patience\" and \"The Choice\", the game won't necessarily show that the tile is happy until you move. Without saying the other conditions, the time to wait is about 10 sec. It also doesn't count if you don't have the window up, because I totally forgot to turn off the bit that tries to not waste resources when not focused.</p>\n<p>Following one of the \"extra challenges\", I'm posting the source code, as well as enough for the source to compile once the dependencies I don't own are added\u00a0. Because the game was made in a custom, partially-made engine I've been working on by myself little-by-little, that includes the engine source as well as the custom tools I used (also unfinished). I don't actually recommend trying to learn off of any of the engine bits.</p>\n<p>That said, consider the source code\u00a0and art asset\u00a0all as under the zlib/libpng license (do as you want with it without attribution, as long as you don't lie about where you got it).\u00a0 I'd rather the music not get reused by others, though I'm not sure why anyone would want to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cefe570a19b8efc4043b6de606041464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin EUMP"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
