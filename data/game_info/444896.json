I wanted to see if i could make a simulation/strategy game with Visionaire Studio, which is primarily suited to make Point and click adventure games. The answer is, yes, theoretically. But it \u00b4s going to take way longer than a two week game jam to really have something i could call a game. Right now it\u00b4s only a proof of concept. <br/></p>\n<p>You can see what the game would look like, you can build 2 kinds of buildings and the corresponding values will change. There is a test expedition map and a test settlement to visit. And that\u00b4s pretty much it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is \u00a0taking place in the same universe as my Rooftops game. <br/></p>\n<p>Planned features:</p>\n<ul><li>More buildings</li><li>Scavenging hunts(pretty much treasure hunts ), those would be small Point and Click adventure parts</li><li>A bigger map to explore</li><li>Diplomacy missions, help other settlements to get Resources, items or get them to \u00a0join you</li><li>Victory conditions(Explorer Victory, Settlement Victory, Scavenging Victory)</li><li>and more...</li></ul><p>Right-clicking changes the cursor, in the demo this is only really necessary while visiting the other settlement. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:02:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adf6df055821ddb5a0fd3ae8cd00f28a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazy duck games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
