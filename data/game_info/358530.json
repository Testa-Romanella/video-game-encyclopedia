Players must stay inside of an ever shrinking ring in order to stay alive. Balls on the ground despawn after a short while, meaning you need to quick. The last major change is the more balls you hold, the slower you move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>Player 1:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, right Shift to throw balls;\u00a0</p><p>Player 2:</p><p>WASD to Move, Q to throw balls</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:30:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc81a020073c00f3b28c86781a0c8be4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wrimor"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
