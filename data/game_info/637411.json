{"id": 637411, "slug": "balloonz-itch", "name": "Balloonz (itch)", "name_original": "Balloonz (itch)", "description": "<p>Simple 2D puzzle game for windows.</p>\n<p>Shoot balloons with a tuba and direct them to the window using fans and bricks.</p>\n<p>Play using mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>Original concept and mechanics. Mostly original assets. Musical backgrounds composed and produced using generative algorithms in Sonic PI. The game was entirely made using free software, including Blender, Cakewalk, GIMP, Inkscape, Krita, Synfig, Terragen, QuixelMixer and Laigter.</p>\n<p>First complete game released by the author. Although this is a complete version, with 12\u00a0stages plus 4 bonus stages and an ending greeting,\u00a0there stills much room for improvement and expansion. Suggestions and critics are welcome.</p>\n<p>Donations may also stimulate me to dedicate more work to this title or a sequel.</p>\n<p>Curiosity: this game was 70% ready when HD content was completely lost due to irreversible damage. Everything had to be redesigned from scratch.</p>\n<p>Game engine: Godot.</p>\n<p>Year of release: 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b04f4ae3afd62d989ae8a4ce0a798f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paranaware"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
