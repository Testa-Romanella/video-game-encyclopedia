The mountain itself perched over the battlefield like a lion welcoming its prey. Even the sun ominously \u2018turned black\u2019 during the desperate struggle that ensued, experiencing a total eclipse at the height of the onslaught. January 22nd, 1879\u2026 the Zulu would call it \u2018The Day of the Dead Moon\u2019.</p>\n<p>As the battle began, the Zulu would appear to grow out of the earth itself, as some 20,000 warriors hastily took up the \u2018Horn\u2019s of the Bull\u2019 formation and readied for the assault. The British stared out over the veldt and into eternity\u2026 the camp was surrounded, surrender was not an option, and retreat was impossible.\u00a0From the \u2018Red Soldiers\u2019 the Zulu expected no quarter and would give none in return.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>uSuthu!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Zulu Dawn!
