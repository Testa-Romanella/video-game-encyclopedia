Sorry for the early release date cause basically, my game is done. I really want to release this to Google Play but I don't have enough money, So here I have a GoGetFundMe Page to fund 25$ for the Google Play Store Publishing or you could just donate here if you like. You might be asking how this can contribute to the #TeamSeas Project? well, half of this game's revenue will be donated to the #TeamSeas Project.\u00a0 Before I end this page, I know you, I mean why isn't there downloads in the game, I think you are just ignoring the page. Please, download now to support me, it would be the greatest pleasure I'll get.\u00a0Thanks.</p>\n<p>Team Seas Website:</p>\n<p>https://teamseas.org</p>\n<p>My Youtube Channel:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHMh-fTm9oCCCYdyl2AXsfA</p>\n<p>GoGetFundMe Page:</p>\n<p>https://fundraiserme.com/campaign/3400/game-development-support-for-13-year-old<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f576e84e9878a4f36a5d9a1c4c6709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Fenderme"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
