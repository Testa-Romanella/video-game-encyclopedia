{"id": 43362, "slug": "shenmue-iii", "name": "Shenmue III", "name_original": "Shenmue III", "description": "<p>Shenmue III is the third part in the Shenmue series of martial action games. Being the belated sequel to 2001 Shenmue II, the game also serves as the series&#39; revival. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Shenmue III continues the story of the protagonist of the previous games: Ryo Hazuki, a young Japanese martial artist from the city of Yokosuka. His goal is to avenge the death of his father. Hazuki follows the murderer, Lan Di, to the mountainous region in China called Guilin. A young Chinese girl named Ling Shenhua, who shares a mysterious spiritual bond with Ryo, accompanies him on his quest. There&#39;s a prophecy that their destinies are intertwined. </p>\n<p>Ryo and Ling walk through various Chinese villages, temples, and fortresses, fighting enemies on their way. They face not only Lan Di but also a new villain named Niao Sun. While the game is set outside Japan, Hazuki can stay in touch with his friends back home by calling them on the phone.</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>The game spent more than ten years in development due to high costs of the original two games (the first Shenmue was the most expensive game ever at the time of its release). Shenmue III only came to be made because of a crowdfunding campaign. This is not the final part of the story, according to the series&#39; creator Yu Suzuki, who is planning more Shenmue games.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T10:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eb5/eb5e27de42914c71aa0b688ae05b58f9.jpg", "website": "https://shenmue.link/?en", "rating": 2.74, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 125, "owned": 926, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 156, "dropped": 19, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 125, "ratings_count": 62, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 65, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Deep Silver", "Ys Net"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
