{"id": 145152, "slug": "terror-tower", "name": "TERROR TOWER", "name_original": "TERROR TOWER", "description": "<p>PLEASE PLAY IN FULLSCREEN MODE<br/>WARNING: MUSIC AND SOUND ARE LOUD</p><p>Terror Tower is a simulation of an arcade cabinet with a classic-style adventure. Get to the top of the tower by midnight to rid yourself of a curse. There are two buttons, one to advance and the other to retreat. Along the way monsters will come and frighten you, increasing your Terror Bar. If it gets too high, you will be scared to death. Retreating will recover your Terror Bar, but you lose an entire half hour while resting.</p><p>There is a known glitch where if you keep mashing the advance button you will plow through walls and monsters. It's because I disabled Twine room transitions and the advance button takes a half second to disable. It doesn't give you any strategic advantage, and plowing through too many monsters without paying attention will kill you anyway, but just wanted to give a heads up.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/037/0372ab0e2aeba89cc0a4e31126757088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
