If you can completely pass it, you are more cattle than my author, and the technology that finally needs the bridge is different from the technology of the high iron bridge. You can be an engineer, too. </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d259f39b0b49be97f6f43094bf06781f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["me"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["me"], "esrb_rating": null}
