Made in less than 48 hours.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe them was: <em><strong>One Room</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>This made me think of two things.</p>\n<p><strong>1) </strong> a tweet for an idea I had months ago before the jam:</p>\r\nGame idea: character stuck inside a single room and no matter what you do it just keeps flashing NOT ENOUGH MEATBALLS!!!<br/>\u2014 Tartle Wizard (@Tartle_Games) August 12, 2016\r\n<p>But that idea has some... Problems. Obviously. It doesn't sound like that much fun.</p>\n<p><strong>2) </strong>The theme reminded me of the <em>box </em>maps I used to download for <em>Quake 3 - </em>one of my favorite games in years of yore.</p>\n<p>So I combined the two and came up with this weird meatball shooter.</p>\n<p><strong>{source code can be found on </strong><strong>GitHub}<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>controls: </strong>WSAD movement, space jump, left mouse shoot.</p>\n<p>Pick meatballs up off ground and shoot them at enemies</p>\n<p>I recommend using Unity Fullscreen button for web player. If you need to regain control of mouse pointer from Chrome or Firefox game window hold down the escape key.</p>\n<p>After the voting ends I plan on updating and adding some new weapons, levels, characters, better music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/6205e07a2c8bd28ccc099626a8212cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Tartle Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
