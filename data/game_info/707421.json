Only available on Windows/PC currently.</p>\n<p>Hey! I'm a student at the University of Florida achieving my bachelors in digital arts &amp; sciences. One of my classes this semester featured creating a video game from scratch. It took many months, all-nighters, and tears of frustration. I am finally done and happy with the project!</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as the wizard named Atticus. Your goal is to collect all 5 crystals and find the secret entrance to Crystal Cave! Avoid mushrooms though, they deal damage and you only have three lives.</p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, esc or quit buttons to quit.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my professor, lecturer, and wonderful classmates.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01e74c884a0a80f7fd12c0ffc27df4d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["happypappysara"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
