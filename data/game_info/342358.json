You get to play the robot running and jumping on platforms while collecting coins and earning points aiming to create a new best score. You have to avoid the enemies(the ghost and the drone). You can kill them by jumping on top of them but if you collide with them head to head you die. Have funIt is available for windows ,linux and mac. I plan on bringing\u00a0Android and iOS version\u00a0 soon</p>\n\n<p>Making this game brought alot of joy to me.jUMPbOT is a celebration of all my below average skills.I learned a lot when making the game from setting deadlines to making art, level design and writing the control statements. I guess jUMPbOT is something fun to do.</p>\n<p>I hope you get to play it and love it much as I did Making it for you. Thank you for taking your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T05:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcf739b22b29b9449b5fca59106c83a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Odrian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
