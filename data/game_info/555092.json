Make combo-moves by hitting the shuttle again and again!<br/></p><p><strong>** A windows build is also available. Please try it if the game runs poorly in the browser</strong></p>\n<p>This game imitates the single-player version of\u00a0Hanetsuki (\u7fbd\u6839\u7a81\u304d), which is a traditional Japanese game that's similar to badminton.<strong> U</strong><strong>se ASWD keys to move around, and press the space key to swing the bat</strong>. Hit the shuttle before it hits the ground to send it back to mid-air.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Try to make combos by hitting the shuttle again and again without a miss!\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tip 1:\u00a0 When the shuttle is hit, it moves towards the direction your character is facing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tip 2: The position where the shuttle will land is marked by the white-ring on the ground. Try to stand in the ring when you swing the bat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly, there isn't a multiplayer-version where Reimu plays against Marisa. I feel like this is what the fellows in Gensokyo would do during the new year.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>** Use of Softwares and Third-Party Assets:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Chibi Basemesh by cantean123 on Sketchfab (CC License)\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/chibi-body-base-mesh-3281a1cffd804f1488b4ec0bbb6...</li><li>Idle and walk cycle animations from mixamo.com</li><li>Character modeling and animation using Autodesk Maya Student Version</li><li>Unity-chan toon shader:\u00a0https://unity-chan.com/download/releaseNote.php?id=UTS2_0&amp;lang=en</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:10:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/698/69814dc0484deedd959b55b48880511b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mark Li"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
