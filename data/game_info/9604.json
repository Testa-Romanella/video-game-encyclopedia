For this reason Whirligig support 3 render paths for you to try, Directshow, Media Foundation and libVLC.<br/><br/><br/><strong>DirectShow</strong><br/>DirectShow offers the best support for playback but requires addition decoders to be installed to get the best from it. Once you've installed the decoders you will have access to a very large range of video playback formats and if you have an Nvidia card you can also take advantage of GPU decoding. There is a full description of how to do this in the forum:<br/>http://steamcommunity.com/app/451650/discussions/0/364042262873027118/<br/><br/><br/><strong>Media Foundation (Windows 8 and 10 only)</strong><br/>Media Foundation offers good suuport for most video formats. It comes as standard on both Windows 8 and 10. If you're consered about installing additional decoders on your system then this is a good option.<br/><br/><br/><strong>libVLC</strong><br/>You can also try libVLC. This is a codec library which has a wide range of built in video decoders and streaming options. This library is used in the popular video player VLC. It offers a larger range of video playback options than Media Foundation and doesn't require decoders to be installed.Image Supportjpg,png,jps,pns<br/>Whirligig works with most jpg and png files but works best when the image file resolution has a factor of 2.<br/><br/><br/>Supported Projection Types<br/><ul><li>Fisheye 100,110,120,130,140,150,160,170,180,190,200,210,220,230,240,250,260,270,280,300,310,320,330,340,350,360<br/></li><li>Barrel 180,360<br/></li><li>Cinema/Flat Screen<br/></li><li>Cinema Curved</li></ul><br/><br/>Custom Enviroments/Rooms<br/><ul><li>Home Cinema<br/></li><li>Bedroom<br/></li><li>Living Room</li></ul><br/><br/><strong>Custom Formats</strong><br/><ul><li>Cube Map Horizontal Tee<br/></li><li>Cube Map Horizontal<br/></li><li>Cube Map Vertical Tee<br/></li><li>Cube Map Vertical<br/></li><li>Facebook Cube Map 3x2<br/></li><li>Facebook Pyramid<br/></li><li>GardenGnome Cube Map 3x2<br/></li><li>Kodak PixPro SP360<br/></li><li>LatLong 360x90<br/></li><li>LG360<br/></li><li>Octane<br/></li><li>Panasonic A500<br/></li><li>Ricoh Theta S<br/></li><li>Samsung Gear 360<br/></li><li>Vray Cubemap Invert<br/></li><li>Vray Cubemap</li></ul><br/>Advice and guides can be found in the discussion forum.http:// http://steamcommunity.com/app/451650/discussions/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-31T07:51:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49211a0a46639b27dca76ea83f519ff.jpg", "website": "http://www.whirligig.xyz/", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 70, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philip Day"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Philip Day"], "esrb_rating": null}
