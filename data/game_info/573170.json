Your goal is to keep each population within specific boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA game is played over various rounds. Each round a threat card is played by AI which changes the population of humans and animals in the world. The player receives 1-4 cards for that round to negate the effects of the threat card. Although the threat card only affects populations when the round ends, player cards may affect populations that round and up to the next two rounds. Plan and play cards carefully. After the last round ends all remaining population modifiers are played out. Keep an eye out for that! To make matters even more interesting, the boundaries for each population may change during the game! And there is a round timer! You'll need quick hands and a quick mind to succeed!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player may apply modifiers to their player cards to pull back from edges. Use them wisely as they tend to run out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T02:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c3203e559595c41f27a659af06ff6508.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chocolate Ship Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chocolate Ship Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
