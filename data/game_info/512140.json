The player is just a boy, you can collect coins, the enemies are slimes and the sky is of course blue.</p>\n<p>Generic Platformer was made as an highschool project where we were to create a platformer and was my first look at programming. The game was made april 2017 in Gamemaker Studio. This was a game I made myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:27:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/8002ce6bbd0a17303fa423ffc5c715dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mattias \"Mau\" Lundell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
