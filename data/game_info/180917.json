I originally had ideas for puzzles, enemies, different types of cheese, etc.</p><p>Use W to hop, A or D to move left or right, the mouse to aim, and left-click to eat/spit out cheese. There are also Xbox 360 gamepad controls involving the two sticks and the right shoulder button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/216f808b15604c208fef432fbc6a8a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
