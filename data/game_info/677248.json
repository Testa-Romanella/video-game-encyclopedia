One day, she learns of an incredibly rare and powerful treasure which could be the answer to all their problems: The Orb of the Abyss.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe orb is locked away in a vault within the Kingdom of Diezel, a land of spiritual worship, but Sylphy's in luck, because Diezel's kicking off a week-long Spirit Festival! She sets sail dreaming of riches, but the mission goes sideways, and she instead ends up robbing the island of its night by freeing the Spirit of the Night, Lyla, who was trapped within the orb. Sylphy then finds herself captured and is swiftly labeled a criminal.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHer only hope of salvation is to help save the kingdom imprisoning her, but she's going to have to travel across the island, garnering the support of people who aren't exactly keen to help her. It's time for Sylphy to return night to the sleepless island!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this time management adventure, you have a week to track down Lyla and garner enough public support to help you on your quest for redemption. Take on missions around the island, complete side jobs to gather funds, and clear dungeons to raise your level!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no need to worry about pesky random battles! During dungeon excursions, basic enemies are defeated simply by running into them, while turn-based combat is reserved for boss fights, each of which has its own gimmick.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo keep the adventure interesting, there's no shortage of minigames! One quest might ask you to engage in a rhythm battle against a group of orcs! Another might transform the game into a first-person dungeon crawler!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComedy-filled Story\n<br/>\nThis is one tale that doesn't take itself too seriously, with plenty of jokes peppered throughout! A boss might beg you to defeat it, some mean-looking orcs might turn out to be nice guys... There's no telling what'll happen next!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTons of Minigames\n<br/>\nFrom herding slimes and avoiding bandits to breaking down doors, there's never a dull moment in this adventure!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTime Management Adventure\n<br/>\nManage your time while taking on quests! Different events will take place across the island depending on the time, so there are plenty of secrets to discover...\n<br/><br/>\n<p>This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.\n<br/>\nBuying this game on GOG you will receive a censored version of the game.
