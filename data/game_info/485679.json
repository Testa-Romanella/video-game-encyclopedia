You must be careful not to spend too long on each platform, because as soon as they spawn, they begin to decay. The platforms spawn as green but gradually transition to red and then vanish. They will decay increasingly quickly as the game goes on, so be careful not to be left behind.</p>\n<p>This game was made in the August of 2020 by Sam\u00a0M</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c79199899ffe62e55cc6f01c0a3cd8c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["as;dlkfja"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
