Stressing them out too much, kills more and more workers until noone is left to create the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>With this, we want to send out a message to everyone. Messing with developers lifetime, is equal to messing with their health. We want to wake people up and rethink their decision about pushing and punishing games and their developers. Because doing so, drives the developers in doing unhealthy decisions and breaks the flow and creativity of the game YOU want. So give them time and let them finish YOUR game, to enjoy it in a complete state and made with love.   </p>\n<p>Creativity takes time. Give it to them. <br/></p>\n<p>==============================================================</p>\n\n<p>How To Play:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Time is running against you.
