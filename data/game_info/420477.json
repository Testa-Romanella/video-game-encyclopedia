It\u2019s alone, unprotected, and piled high with an unfeasibly large pile of consumer goods. You\u2019re the only ones here \u2013 you can take the stuff, or try to deliver it to children around the world. Only, first you have to figure out how to make it <em>stop</em>.</p>\n<p>Sleigh w/Me is a madcap, quickfire game where you play children trying to save Christmas, or criminals trying to steal it. Either way, you're stuck on an out-of-control sleigh and you need to get it to safety!</p>\n<p>Excellent for playing with children or adults alike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cde4fa41d7f48523a8cc62fd4a0690c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlackArmada"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
