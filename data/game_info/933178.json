Every location in the game with a street address is a place where mail needs to be delivered. This will also be indicated by an <em>envelope</em> next to the address in the info bar. Once you've delivered the mail to that location, a <em>checkmark</em> will replace the envelope. You can check your progress in the <em>Pause Menu</em> which will show you how many homes out of the total you've delivered to.\r\n\t\t</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\tSome deliveries are as simple as interacting with the front door. Others require you to use an item from your inventory. All of them have an amusing obstacle that prevents your first day on the job from being as easy and care free as it should be!\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tControls\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tPress the <em>A Button</em> to \"look\".
