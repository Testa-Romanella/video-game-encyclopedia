However, the gameplay concept is still far from playable as can be seen from this prototype. It is not solid enough to convince me it is worth making into a full game with more content.</p>\n<p>The assets used in this prototype are mostly from Unity store (Both free &amp; paid)</p>\n<p>I try to polish the game as much as I can think of, but there are still countless points to work on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have set the deadline as the end of year 2021 to experiment how far I\u00a0could push the project. I\u00a0may pick and improve the project with some minor updates, but there won't be any major updates since all significant changes would be put into a future successor project.</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting this project and please feel free to give me feedback &amp; guidance.</p>\n<p>I appreciate all opinions, Thank you very much !</p>\n<p>Please look forward to my future projects !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f28bdaf17015eaa7b6775cb9cd2b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sazero"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
