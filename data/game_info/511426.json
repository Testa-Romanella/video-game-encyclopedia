How nice would it be to escape from this place? There is a problem though: all your organs were taken from you before you were embalmed and mummified. Without them, you will never be able to leave the Pyramid. Find them and leave this forsaken place! But be warned, that your tomb is like a labyrinth and has some surprises lurking around the corner.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Walk with your arrow keys or WASD. All bouncing items can be picked up by walking over them. After you gathered a stone and found the slingshot you can kill enemies by pressing space. Tip: find yourself a light source early in the game ;)</p>\n\n<p>The code for the game and credits for used assets can be found on GitHub.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T07:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3ef0a3408e587bd4e07daa99bea90744.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nikl", "jennifervphan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
