So there are a lot of bugs and this is quite common in lawns.</p><p>It is playable. Levels can be accomplished. There is no check if the lawn is completed yet.</p><p>There is not tutorial yet. So here are some instructions:</p><p>- One thing that could be unclear is that you have to click tile in small 3x3 patterns to change their states.<br/></p><p>- If the small pattern matches with main lawn then first action is performed. If not - the second one. It works just like IF ELSE statements</p><p>- Intruction PASS means \"just go to next pattern\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7aa214b76f9859a837c3974371a3718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["gregoryprogrammer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
