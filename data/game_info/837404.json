However, this is only an idea/draft of the game. If you would like to try it please play it on a PC browser or with a keyboard and mouse as it does not support touch controls (You don't need a mouse, tapping the screen to start will work as well). Starting the game will show the controls. Consider donating if you would like for it to be a full game! I will try to respond to any forums/threads/replies as quick as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1dcc86df949b6bc0fc022a9f01d45d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joeysquatch12"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
