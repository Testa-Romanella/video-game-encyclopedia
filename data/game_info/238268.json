Hitting an enemy in their respective weak point (usually the head) always results in a critical hit, however, any location has a chance of doing critical damage. For most guns, each shot uses ammunition, which must eventually be reloaded by pressing space or by attempting to fire while out of ammunition. Some weapons also feature different shooting techniques, such as the difference between guns (It hits the point you have clicked on) and bowguns (Everything in the path from the originating shot to where you clicked will be hit). A skill called Bow Mastery enables the player's arrows to travel through more enemies, becoming more and more effective against mobs.<br/><br/>Control:<br/>Tap: Shoot<br/>Tap with 2nd finger: Switch weapon<br/>2 finger tap: Reload", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-03T20:45:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a589c614d728c5b08cb2f2bb79c0b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jonathan Jobs"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Jobs"], "esrb_rating": null}
