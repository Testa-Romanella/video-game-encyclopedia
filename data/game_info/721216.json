A small alien called Diasi was traveling across the Galaxy. Suddenly he noticed some problems with his spacecraft. Fortunately, he saw a small, unfamiliar planet and decided to land there to check what's wrong. But while he was trying to land, he lost control over the ship and crashed. He was alone in the unknown. None of the systems was working. He was about to cry when he saw a huge mountain with an appealing light. It was so tempting that he couldn't resist touching it. But there was a lot of danger around him and no one to help him discover the planet. So he had to run, watching out for the hostile autochthons...</p>\n<p>Try to survive as long as possible. Don't be too confident. There are mysterious and dangerous creatures on this planet. So run and do not look back!
