When you collect a shoot power-up, you have to tap very quickly to shoot. Each shoot power-up gives you 3 more shots. You can store 9 shots at a time at most. The shield power-up makes you invincible to one obstacle, then destroys the obstacle and times out. Each coin power-up increases you score by 15, and your score also increases by 1 every half second. There is also a pretty awesome power-up that you need at least 6\u00a0bullets to get, good luck getting it :)</p>\n<p>This is an infinite game, try to make it as far as possible!\u00a0<br/>There are 8 different types of obstacles:</p>\n<p>1. Blockade (purple): Moves downwards normally.</p>\n<p>2. Pulse (yellow): Grows and shrinks in a set pattern.</p>\n<p>3. Rotate (green): Rotates on a center axis.</p>\n<p>4. Ticker (orange): Turns off-axis every half second.</p>\n<p>5. Wobble (pink): Shakes slightly while wobbling back and forth.</p>\n<p>6. Ricochet (light blue): Bounces around your screen for 5-10 seconds before disappearing.</p>\n<p>7. Turret (black): Moves back and forth across the top of your screen, shooting every 1.5 seconds. It does so for 5-10 seconds.</p>\n<p>8. Speeder (dark blue): Gradually speeds up as it zooms up and down while maintaining a fixed horizontal position.</p>\n<p>This game was made in under 48 hours.</p>\n<p>My highscore is 587. How far can you go? :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/8407b98332147e01971a2c9ba51b80b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MegaProgramGuy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
