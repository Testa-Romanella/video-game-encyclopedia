Quickly realizing light is the only thing that keeps the spirit at bay, you must turn all the lights on if you hope to survive.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the game I would greatly appreciate everyone's feedback as this is my first game I've made outside of a game jam. If you would like to further support me a donation here would be awesome. It will help me to further pursue my dream of being an indie game dev.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:32:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e18082f01c70ba13d66ba122794437ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChilledHeightsStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
