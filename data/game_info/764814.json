After several years away studying medicine in Jerusalem, The Doctor arrives in Kr\u00f3wka in an attempt to help develop a cure. Equipped with bravery, your trusty cane and with\u00a0the help of Gregori, your devoted and equally brilliant assistant, perhaps the two of you can stay the complete destruction of the city and cure the Miasma that weighs like a curse upon the land.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T09:30:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb7f4ac9eaa53457546d53a1559bd0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MezzanineGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
