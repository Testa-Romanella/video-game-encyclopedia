The concept is really simple. Try to meet the two balls with the help of objects that you draw yourself. <br/>The objects and the balls react to physic laws, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>The game is very simple to play but extremely challenging but fun at the same time . Just put your finger on the screen and try to draw a path of lines from one ball to another.<br/><br/>Looks easy? Try it out and let us know your feedbacks to make it even better!<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b60494e1ae1226fef6fdf6f57c4233.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aljosa Pavsic"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Aljosa Pavsic"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
