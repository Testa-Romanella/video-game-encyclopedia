Opposing soldiers will walk along a \n      predetermined path, and it is therefore your mission to successfully \n      defend your waypoint. Enemies will come in waves, trying to invade your \n      territory. If you can keep them from reaching the end of the path, then \n      victory is secured. If the enemies manage to slip by your defenses, they \n      will damage your defense point. If the defense point number reaches 0, \n      then it is your defeat.\n    </p><p>\n      Features\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Tower defense game!<br/>\u2022 Chinese history!<br/>\u2022 Epic story \n      from the Three Kingdoms!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad3e88e93518fc6be72d5f81c36ad3ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Aksys Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
