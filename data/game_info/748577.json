With the fierce backing of Esperkind behind the kingdom, it appeared that nothing would disrupt the immense prosperity that Lindblum was experiencing until Esperkind suddenly turned against Lindblum. The game follows the adventures of a young Augurer (specially trained anti-Esper monster summoner) named Zephyr Highwind who is forced to abandon his simple lifestyle of looking after Winter, a white chocobo which belonged to his deceased sister Ezra. With new friends aiding him, Zephyr seeks to put an end to the rising hostilities between Lindblum and the Espers, led by Ramuh, before the conflict engulfs the entire globe.</p>\n<p>Blackmoon Prophecy II features twelve main characters, five optional characters, and two guest characters. Expected playtime should be in the range of 40+ hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-03T23:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d94fa4d2d4e2caee81af925cb35b84.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/5722/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
