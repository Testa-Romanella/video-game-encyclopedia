A commute to the fields, for harvest. A conversation with her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a short work of interactive fiction, the length of one conversation on one shuttle ride. I estimate it will take about ten minutes from start to finish, although your total time spent\u00a0may vary depending on your reading speed and the choices you make.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created in Twine. There's no sound or anything like that.\u00a0It will technically work on mobile, but the layout might not always be ideal.
