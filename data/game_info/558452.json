Escape the wicked confines of the dungeon using your dash abilities- and your ability to endlessly respawn. There are all sorts of obstacles, from spikes to lasers to even dynamite - but the most dangerous of all is the timer. You only have a few seconds to make it through each level before you explode, so think fast!</p>\r\nControls:\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ol><li>\u00a0- WASD/Arrow\u00a0Keys to move</li><li>\u00a0- Space to jump (or w/up arrow with tap-jump)</li><li>\u00a0- W/Up arrow to enter door</li><li>\u00a0- Z/Either Shift to Dash</li><li>\u00a0- Q\u00a0to Self-destruct</li><li>\u00a0- Esc to pause</li></ol>\r\nController\r\n<ol><li>\u00a0- Left stick to Move</li><li>\u00a0- A/B to Jump</li><li>\u00a0- Up on left stick to enter door</li><li>\u00a0- X/Y or bumpers to Dash</li><li>\u00a0 Select/Back to self-destruct</li><li>\u00a0 Start to Pause\u00a0\u00a0</li></ol>\n\n<p>Music Credit: Lone Peak Music:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmjpnzGxSBgjwe1Aij7FfMw</p>\n<p>Font Credit: Tiny Worlds Asset\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8c223e66120c5d5072c4300894acb28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Epicphail2"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
