I hope this gets on The Useless Web, even though it's a part of itch.io. Just watch Kaito clap with ice cream on his head because you will possibly unlock Luka and Miku.

I hope you enjoy, even though this is useless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7a/a7a48907d2e75f7d17ffea5379228efa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kawaii-Kowai Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
