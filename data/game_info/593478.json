There are always useful orders to give, but trying to perform 200 APM just isn't relaxing anymore.\r\n </p>\n<p>We'll, I had this feeling, that's why I developed this game. It's a quite normal RTS game with units shooting at each other, control points, bases to spawn units. However, you are only allowed to give a move order (to an existing or new spawned unit) every 10 seconds, resulting in exactly 6 APM. Not the quickness of the commander is decisive, but good decisions \u2013 the game gives you enough time to analyse the situation and plan your next move. <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>To win a game, bring the health bar of you opponent to zero by holding the majority of the control points or by damaging the opponents base.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>Available game modes:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li> <p>versus AI (five \tdifficulties: easy, normal, hard, extreme, \tinsane)\r\n \t\r\n</p></li><li> <p>multiplayer \t(two players, local \thotseat)\r\n \r\n</p></li></ul>\n<p>To learn how to play the game, see the ingame tutorial.\r\n </p>\n<p>Controls: keyboard and mouse.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The web app is a demo that can be played in a browser, but performance and graphics are limited (see videos for comparison).
