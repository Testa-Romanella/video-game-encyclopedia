Dive into some backstory with mission 3 of the campaign, where you meet an old friend with Alpha 1.20! If you have any questions or suggestions, then comment down below and ill surely take them into consideration ! :D</p>\n<p>Fixed Bugs:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -Ship would sometimes disappear when spawning in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -The frigate you must travel to is sometimes too far away, flying to it would result in teleporting you far from the solar system</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Sometimes, the procedural algorithms wouldn't work properly when pressing NEW GAME. Would result in you being far away from a random solar system forever. (Is this is still happening, contact me, and know that it should work if you close and reopen the application. Not much work will be lost as it was a NEW GAME.)</p>\n<p>Title screen: w or up arrow to shoot laser pointer</p>\n<p>In game : mouse to look w or up arrow to move forward</p>\n<p>On Planet : up arrow to move forward, SPACE to fly/land, press X while flying to escape planet.</p>\n<p>'P' for entering/exiting placing structures mode</p>\n<p>'Right Mouse Button' for placing down structures.</p>\n<p>'E' for interacting with structures</p>\n<p>'E' for navigating through inventory or structure mode</p>\n<p>While a weapon is in hand, press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to shoot. Reloading occurs automatically when the clip is empty.</p>\n<p>Also I want to give a big shoutout to Laikos Vidar for modeling the weapon models implemented into update 1.10. He saved me lots of time and the models are fantastic!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905f2664226d2b48a2eab7636eb8900b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Googoo03"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
