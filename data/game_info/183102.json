Otherwise you lose. And you don't want to lose.</p><p>Press right to spin the cursor clockwise, and left to turn it anti-clockwise. Controllers are supported too if you swing that way.</p><p>Easy mode is easy, consider it training wheels, just to get you into the swing of things. Hard mode is where all the fun happens. Remember momentum.</p><p>Made for the <strong>#texturelessjam2015 </strong>jam in 4 days.
