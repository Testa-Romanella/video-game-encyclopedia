Your goal: disrupt the game as MUCH AS YOU CAN. Will you roll a critical one and destroy half the playtable in the process? Or will you use the law of physics to roll in a poor players eye for bonus points? Try to score as highly as possible in each of the levels.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022.
