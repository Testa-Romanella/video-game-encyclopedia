For future adaptations, we're looking into Vive, Oculus GO and Gear VR.</li></ul><strong>Is This Game Scary?</strong><ul><li>Kinda sorta, more like 'delightfully suspenseful' or 'pleasantly jumpy'. This is definitely not a horror type of VR game, those are the worst for your nerves, where you think you're gonna get murdered around the next turn. No, this is more like the \"No freaking way this is happening to me\" kind of game, and then you giggle, there's maybe going to be some giggling.</li></ul><strong>Locomotion Options?</strong><ul><li>Nope! While you'll be able to interact with stuff, we don't believe in just letting you wander around on your own, that's way to risky.
