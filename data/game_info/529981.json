Uploaded to Scratch in\u00a0Sep 03, 2017.</p>\n<p>Scratch Instructions Text:</p>\n<p>Please read all of the instructions before playing. Double Click Green Flag Do not press the legendary Go Pro Hero 5 Black twice beacuse it made my computer really laggy. The lag will stop in about 10 hours unless you are very lucky. So first, you need to get as many GoPros as you can. To get cash, You tap \"Cash?\" and then, you'll get some fresh cash right out of the game. But, there's kinda a side effect to that. It costs money. If you want a quadrillion dollars, (That's actually a number.) You need to pay $179.99. In the next one, you can earn them. And the \"Help\" button will be recorded from audio. You have to wait a sec for the game to complete because this game eats up a lot of data. I'm sorry it took me a long time to make. C- Grabbing the stickman Use WASD or arrow keys and space to move. R- Firework Audio Version H- Help A- Redo Backdrop Editing P- Pause to not damage your eyes. WARNING!!!! Do not press \"p\" and then press \"r\" beacause it will totally crash your computer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:46:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f64aaf3eebacef0214c4819fe1718021.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Speedgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
