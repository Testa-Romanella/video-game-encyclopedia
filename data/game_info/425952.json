But, it gives you some different and unique experiences.</p>\n<p>I was inspired by so many games that give me some strange feelings. Those are mixed with my faith and values and then created an inexplicable feeling. Finally, I thought I had to express it through the way that I can do the best. It was a game. And I have done making this. Hope you enjoy it and hope that you can come up with some feelings while playing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:37:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbfdac49a503dcf82f12baa8e55d8055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jinyongna"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
