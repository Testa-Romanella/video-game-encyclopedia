It\u2019s still early and we want to ensure that the game is created with the utmost care and attention to detail, therefore, while we\u2019re excited to share the news with you, we want to ask you for patience as it will be a while until we start talking about this project in detail.\r\n\r\nThe Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD PROJEKT RED. It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it feels just as big, if not bigger,\u201d said Adam Badowski, Head of Studio, CD PROJEKT RED. \u201cCollaborating with Fool\u2019s Theory on the project is just as exciting, as some of the people there have been previously involved in The Witcher games. They know the source material well, they know how much gamers have been looking forward to seeing the remake happen, and they know how to make incredible and ambitious games. And although it will take some time before we\u2019re ready to share more about and from the game, I know it\u2019ll be worth the wait.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-04-29T14:18:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c8a63ff464b87fac32c10b3f30ca0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 1, "toplay": 12, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5", "PC"], "developers": ["Fool's Theory"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["CD PROJEKT RED"], "esrb_rating": null}
