And you can design your own levels by simply painting pixels in any image modifying software. Use arrow keys to move the paddle, and press enter to spawn a new ball into the level. Pause and escape buttons\u00a0do what you think they might do.</p>\n<p>The game kind of developed itself, and it is my first game, may be that's why... The 15 levels (image files) I have put in the folder are very hard, so the game is pretty much unbeatable in my opinion, but suit yourself. I did so, cuz you can modify them anytime anyway. Think of it like a challenge :P</p>\n<p>For the security related issues;\u00a0I didn't include any certificates in it, so although whatever protection software you may have installed on your device may alarm when you first try to run the game, after scanning it for a while, they should all be able to figure that it's nothing but\u00a0a game. At least that was the case for me.</p>\n<p>That's all. I hope you enjoy it. And\u00a0please don't hesitate to post any questions/comments/feedback, since I really like reading that stuff. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cb749685e5bed4893c4549d3e919da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["mayonnace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
