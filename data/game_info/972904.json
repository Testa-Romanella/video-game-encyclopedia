While it's kind of handy, it isn\u2019t exactly the most useful for combat, so you aren\u2019t about to go battling monsters and sweeping princesses off their feet. <br/><br/>Who wants to be stuck in town peddling wares like some kind of NPC when day in and day out all sorts of fantasy babes are strutting up and down the streets in those skimpy outfits! With a little creative crafting you\u2019ll be set with all the magical tools you need to bring these women onto their knees. Magic lube, slime traps, leashes and more, oh my!<br/><br/><br/>Hilde, the Dark Elf Dancer, is known all across town for her impish personality, she *dances* on the fine line between flirty and friendly! She walks around town in that skimpy dancer outfit, showing off the goods and leaving little to the imagination. With a little magic intervention to make yourself her #1 VIP, you\u2019ll be getting access to all kinds of private dances.<br/><br/><br/>This half-devil sorceress is a cutie with a booty, and plump thighs that certainly saved lives!! Chloe is an introverted magical item otaku, so it is up to you to unlock the secret slut hiding behind those innocent eyes by snapping her choker and keeping your new pet on a tight leash, literally! <br/><br/><br/>This elf princess looks down on humankind, especially trashy item merchants like our protag! Don\u2019t take this insult lying down, and show her what a human male is really capable of. With a little slimy help you\u2019ll teach Eilen that her place is literally beneath you \u2665<br/><br/><br/>A princess knight beloved by the people, Tiaris\u2019 heart full of honor and courage- and soon her womb will be full of your baby batter! Help her out on a quest to defeat some liches, and be repaid with all sorts of bodily riches.<br/><br/><br/>This water goddess has gotta take responsibility for bringing you to the new fantasy world, and what better way to do it than by satisfying your need to breed. With some carefully crafted items, you\u2019ll be able to humiliate her and have her worship the divine dickings you dole out instead!<br/><br/>With your harem down to serve your every need and take care of business in your stead, you\u2019ll be able to expand your influence across the world. Knights, ghosts, and even kings won\u2019t be able to stand up to you! Lord it over the world with all the bangable babes just begging to be bred.<br/><br/>Using your magic creation to remake these infallible maidens into your masochistic pisspots- now that\u2019s alchemy! <br/><ul><li>Translated version of the original Japanese Visual Novel<br/></li><li>These fantasy ladies are fully voiced with original Japanese dialogue<br/></li><li>Original artwork HD upscaled with 16:9 and 4:3 variants<br/></li><li>Hours of story content<br/></li><li>Audio including music and special effects<br/></li><li>Enhanced with character sprite animations<br/></li><li>Gallery and Scene selections<br/></li><li>Over 30 magically enhanced H-Scenes to enjoy!</li></ul><br/>Manwhore Merchant: Breeding in Bulk Is the English localization of a Visual Novel originally created by prolific Japanese developer Miel.
