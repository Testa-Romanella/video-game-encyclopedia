Roll the dice to determine how many steps you shall take. Then choose if you would like to play through the level, or spin the slot machine for a chance to skip the level entirely. Be wary though, if you get an unlucky result on the slot machine you may have to go back a few spaces. When playing through combat levels use WASD/Arrow keys to move and Left Mouse Button to swing your sword. Good luck player.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Team<br/></strong></p>\n<p>SkyanSam<br/><em>Code</em></p>\n<p>Markus Deitrick (TearButtowski)<br/><em>Code, Art<br/></em></p>\n\n<p>MilanVal<em>Art</em></p>\n\n<p>Joybree<em>Art</em></p>\n<p>ShelfMaster360<em>Art</em><br/></p>\n<p>Kantilopie Pie<em>Music</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Other Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>InspectorJ - Bamboo Swing, A9.wav<br/>taroo - Naughty Cat Cute Background Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4ff93d0ac0345c4d972d29dfffd5ae0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SkyanSam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
