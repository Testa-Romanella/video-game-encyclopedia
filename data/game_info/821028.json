You're confused, but you pick up the dice and take them with you as you explore. Later, you stumble upon a scrap of old paper with some writing scrawled on it. It says:</p>\n<p><em>Only the magic dice can defeat the crab people...</em></p>\n<p>Wait... Crab people? Uh oh...</p>\n\n<p>Submission to 2022 GMTK Game Jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>W/S - move forward/backward</p>\n<p>A/D - turn left/right</p>\n<p>SPACE - jump</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Navigate the dungeon. Don't fall in the water. When in range of an enemy, click \"Roll!\" to add a die to the board (this uses one of your dice). If you aren't happy with the number you rolled, you can click on the die to roll it again. Once you're ready, click \"Attack!\" to deal damage to the enemy equal to the sum of all the dice. But hurry -- if an enemy attacks while you're still rolling, you lose all the dice on your board.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fed/fedf70f1c9f66554c5c45e035b9a09e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Cal Jepso"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
