[Demo]", "description": "<p>One night, around half the people in The Continent (it's a pretty laid-back place, nobody really cares to give it a name) receive a mysterious dream. A rather flustered angel broadcasts a \"prophecy\" to as many people as she can:<br/></p>\r\n\"Your world is like, totally doomed.\r\n...Yes, again, but like for\u00a0<em>real</em>\u00a0this time!\"\r\n\n<p>Well, this isn't really anything out of the ordinary. There's always some Dark/Evil/Cursed King/Queen/Princess or another raising a fuss in The Continent, some heroines will show up and take care of it eventually.</p>\n\n<p>But who will step up to the plate this time?\u00a0A medieval knight, a tomboy with a baseball bat, a ninja, a magical girl... what's going on with this setting? Just, in general. What a strange place.</p>\n<p>Six women from all around The Continent team up to take on the Dark Evil Generals, storm the Dark Evil Castle, and take down the Dark Evil Queen for what might <em>finally </em>be the last time!</p>\n\n<p>A cute and colorful turn-based RPG in a quaint little\u00a0fantasy world with only one continent, where humans and monsters have made some compromises to\u00a0live together in relative peace... at least until the current head of the Dark Evil Royal Family decides to try starting yet another apocalypse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will Feature:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Action and drama, comedy and romance\u00a0(of the sapphic variety)!</li><li>Fully original graphics and soundtrack, with little to no stock/RTP assets anywhere in the game <strong>(currently a work in progress; all sound effects and many music tracks are still placeholder at the moment)</strong></li><li>6 playable party members with plenty of possibly synergies and powerful team combinations</li><li>Over 150 different monsters and 40 boss battles, ranging from silly little encounters to truly challenging confrontations</li><li>10+ hours of gameplay, but without <em>any\u00a0</em>grinding or\u00a0pointless backtracking, no overly long dungeons or damage-spongy bosses, and\u00a0plenty of avoidable encounters <strong>(current demo covers the first 2-3 hours of the game)</strong></li><li>Customizable difficulty settings to make the game easier\u2014or much, <em>much </em>harder\u2014whenever you feel like it</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Made in RPG Maker MV</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game is currently in development. Although demo saves won't carry over to the final version, I'll upload a folder with saves for each chapter so you can pick up right where you left off if you buy the full game (the price will likely be around $10-15 on release, but the demo will always be free).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the meantime here are some links you can use to follow the game's ongoing development or check out some members of the dev team:</strong></p>\n<p>Fiore's Twitter - Lead developer, artist, writer, programmer, etc. I post updates here every once in a while<br/></p>\n<p>Gubbles'\u00a0Twitter &amp; Website\u00a0- Audio designer, composer, and all-around SFX magician</p>\n<p>FireLily Games Discord - Frequently posted updates on anything that Fiore is working on, including occasional playtest builds.
