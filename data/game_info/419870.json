(Rosequartzklein)", "description": "<p>A small piece made for the Autistica play jam.<br/>Theme: \"Hidden in Plain Sight\"<br/></p>\n<p>Some autistic people can find it hard to <strong>identify their emotions</strong>. This is called alexithymia. This means that some people may not realise that they need to look for support or may not be able to talk about how they\u2019re feeling when they are struggling.<br/><br/>Additionally, for many autistic people, sensory difficulties make settings such as large social gatherings a difficult and demanding experience. <br/><br/>Please donate  to support Autistica in their mission to provide resources to members of the autistic community. <br/><br/>Other than a major bug which required the impeccable help of Sean on the bitsy discord, everything in this piece was created over about 8 hours. If you haven't checked out the Bitsy game engine, I highly recommend it for fun little projects like this! <br/></p>\n<p>Might update later on to polish the game a bit, some parts of it are clunky, though I'm still pretty proud of the basic mechanic.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T04:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/42067a1dd61e6702288b703fbf9b4a15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rosequartzklein"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
