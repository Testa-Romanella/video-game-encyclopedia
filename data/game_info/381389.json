My title ane text in game are referenced from the lyrics of this song. Actually I would like to have this song as the bgm but this is a compo so I can only improvise my own bgm.</p>\n<p><em>Instruction are inclued in game</em>:</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>\u00a0-&gt; Forward\u00a0<strong>S</strong>\u00a0-&gt; Slow Down\u00a0<strong>A, D</strong>\u00a0-&gt; Adjust Direction</p>\n<p>There are few instruction/direction in game, which is kind of bad because i have no time to do this (got homework and midterm tomorrow and I had to review and finish assignment in these 2 days).
