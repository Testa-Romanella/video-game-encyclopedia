First, you overslept on your work. Secondly, you let my host passed through the security.. \u00a0And finally, you didn\u2019t install protection to your co-workers at NAF inc.\u00a0and nearby innocents. Yeah, it sounds very bad for you because it will automatically make you a bad sinner. However, a good friend of mine, the Almighty True Evil, has insisted to give you another chance to redeem yourself. And so, I decided to make you go through this gruesome trail, the Path of Sins! Once you pass the trail, my friend will like to see you in person. Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da9927bb3f253bdcf9563906b40de914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s1nner"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
