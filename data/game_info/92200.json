Time slows as you open the building menu, and each wall and turret slams into the ground instantly via a drop pod: there\u2019s no faffing around with build times. Calling for a wall to arrive in just the right place at just the right time is damn satisfying\u00a0.</em></p>\n<p>Rock Paper Shotgun by\u00a0Matt Cox\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Mechs V Kaijus\u00a0impresses with its cool pixel art visuals and addictive hardcore tower defense gameplay.
