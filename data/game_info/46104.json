Slash your way through everything that moves; dive into neon signs for camouflage; or maybe do a little bit of both (who would we be to judge...that's Neon's job).FEATURES<ul><li>Mega Man-like Progression and Upgrades<br/></li><li>Hand-Drawn Cartoon Art-Style<br/></li><li>Intense Boss Battles<br/></li><li>Dynamic Soundtrack<br/></li><li>Leaderboards for Hardcore Speedrunning<br/></li><li>Gamepad Support</li></ul>NON-LINEAR GAMEPLAYA boss select screen that lets players choose the order they\u2019ll take down the bosses, making each play through of the game unique. Defeating bosses will unlock different items leading players to develop their own strategy.\u2028 (or googling one)ARTSTYLEEverything in Neon the Ninja is drawn by hand. This means every movement Neon makes is animated from a series of individual drawings, not Flash or any other animation shortcuts.INTENSE BOSS BATTLESWe want every boss battle to feel special and be chock full of \u201cOH SHIT\u201d moments. While these fights are going to be tough they also need to feel fair.DYNAMIC SOUNDTRACKIt\u2019s only fitting that Neon slays enemies to a soundtrack that equally slays the player. Expect lots of driving guitar- and synth-based music influenced by the game\u2019s unique environments.MODERN LOOK, RETRO FEELThough we love retro video games, we recognize that re-creating every aspect of \u201880s and \u201890s games isn\u2019t what we want to do. Meaning: the games of that era weren\u2019t designed to have \u201cpixel art and chiptunes.\u201d Pixel art and chiptunes were simply the tools available to the developers at the time.<br/> <br/><br/>Instead of trying to re-create the audio/visual aesthetic of our beloved retro games, then, we\u2019re focusing on achieving the SPIRIT of classic games like Ninja Gaiden and Mega Man while using the modern tools of Wacom tablets and real musical instruments.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d983644fd3f1829ce632909abe80ce.jpg", "website": "http://www.neontheninja.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["New 90's Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New 90's Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
