{"id": 305279, "slug": "worlds-bane-prototype", "name": "World's Bane Prototype", "name_original": "World's Bane Prototype", "description": "<p><strong>World's Bane</strong>\u00a0is a simulation strategy game where the player is a demon overlord invading randomly generates fantasy worlds. Inspired by story generators like RimWorld, Crusader Kings 2 and Dwarf Fortress, players will be able to explore, exploit and corrupt worlds populated by fully simulated characters with AIs governed by their traits, needs and relationships.</p>\n<p>The current version is <strong>an\u00a0early\u00a0prototype</strong> mainly focused on the basic behavior of our\u00a0NPC AIs. We want to get early feedback from testers about the NPC's movement and interactions. Note that the characters have generic vanilla personality for now. Once we are happy with the baseline behavior, we will start introducing traits to simulate different personalities and quirky behavior. Character interactions with other characters are still undercooked and should get much better once we revamp our pathfinding system.</p>\n<p>Things you can test out:</p>\n<ul><li>Demo currently uses a fixed\u00a0World Map with five Landmark\u00a0Locations.</li><li>NPCs and Interior Maps of Landmark Locations are randomly generated each playthrough based on a few parameters. Plenty of assets here are placeholder and characters still lack many animations. Settlement Map layout is still quite ugly tbh. We're working on this :)</li><li>NPCs need to eat, sleep and have fun. They should be able to perform different actions to fulfill these needs.</li><li>When their needs are satisfied,\u00a0NPCs in a settlement perform work. Residents have different roles that govern the type of work they do. Currently, Civilians are able to obtain Supply and transfer it to the Warehouse. Soldiers can Patrol. Adventurers,\u00a0Nobles and\u00a0Faction\u00a0Leader work actions will come in the future. More work actions will be added for Civilians and\u00a0Soldiers.</li><li>The player can gather Intel that stores data about an event, or an item or object's location, or a character's plans. For now, Intel is used in conjunction with the Diplomat's Share Intel action.</li><li>The player has five Agent Roles that can perform different actions targeting characters. We've included early versions to give you a rough idea of what we're going for but expect these to be incomplete,\u00a0buggy and in need of further tweaks and streamlining:</li><ul><li><strong>Spy</strong> - Currently has the <strong><em>Track</em></strong> action that allows the player to keep track of a character's actions even while focused on a different character.</li><li><strong>Seducer</strong> - Currently has the <strong><em>Corrupt</em></strong> action which may inflict various status effects on a character like Lycanthropy, Vampirism,\u00a0Kleptomania, etc. Wasn't able to finish implementation for this build (sorry!)</li><li><strong>Diplomat</strong> - Currently has the <strong><em>Share Intel</em></strong> action which transfers information from an\u00a0Intel to another character. For now, the player may store an Abduction Event as an Intel and then share it with a\u00a0Soldier or Adventurer\u00a0characters that have a friendly relationship with the abducted. The character should then attempt to rescue the abducted.</li><li><strong>Instigator</strong> - Currently has the <strong><em>Rile Up</em></strong> action. When used on a Beast, the player may instruct it to go berserk at a certain location. When used on a Goblin or Skeleton, the player may instruct it to abduct a character from a different faction</li><li><strong>Debilitator</strong> - Currently has the <strong><em>Intervene</em></strong> action which stops the current action of the target character.</li><li>Many more actions will be added in the future.</li></ul></ul>\n<p>For anyone interested in providing feedback, you are welcome to join our Discord group:\u00a0https://discord.gg/TZHjsEy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e8a168bef9c64babf61c7ddb8a3606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maccima"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
