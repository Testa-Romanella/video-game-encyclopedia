The theme is \"Roll the dice\".</p>\n<p>I like playing tabletop RPGs but I get tired of rolling dice and waiting for my turn and waiting for resolution. I thought I would make a game where the dice get rolled for you, and there are special abilities when you roll the dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam, and first\u00a0time using Unity, and I\u2019m a solo dev who only really worked ~15 hours on this game due to personal time constraints. Most of the time I spent was just spent working on understanding the engine rather than working on mechanics or graphics.</p>Cut FeaturesI had hoped to implement the following, but didn't have time due to the time constraints. They may be added at a future date.<p>- Enemy attacks back</p><p>- Visible enemy life bar</p><p>- Bonus damage totalled separately to regular damage</p><p>- Multiple enemies</p><p>- Money system on enemy slain</p><p>- Progression system where you start with one character and easy enemies, gain gold and can purchase more abilities, characters, and upgrade your dice portals</p><p>- Better crit animations when big damage happens</p><p>- healer character</p><p>- different special abilities that leverage other mathematical dice patterns for bonus</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets are royalty free or under the CC license.</p>\n<p><strong>Sprites provided by:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://luizmelo.itch.io/\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Die model:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dice-7a3863693fb041e2804cc126a09f77b8\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Background Music:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Retro Platforming</strong> <strong>- </strong>By David Fesliyan\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/8-bit-music/6</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c4d046806078d6b98a62109430f79f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dontot8"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
