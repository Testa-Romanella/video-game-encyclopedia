I mean both our development and the game itself. So if you want to make development a little less hell for us please playtest this first buggy build of our game! We appreciate any and all feedback!</p>\n<p>We wanted this game to be able to show how horribly frustrating the New York subway is but also how immensly weird and fun it can be. We want the game to be an exaggerated experience of what we felt our first time navigating the subway and we hope it's relatable to New Yorkers and fun for those who have no experience with public transit. Let us know how the experience is for you whether you are transit user or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:21:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cbc6c297e61046ee2f488bf59d660b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kevin Ray", "RileeHorowitz", "Annamaria Koshy", "Carsen Decker", "Kate Howell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
