{"id": 490533, "slug": "retrocycles", "name": "Retrocycles", "name_original": "Retrocycles", "description": "In Retrocycles, you ride a bizarre vehicle that can never stop and leaves a deadly trail behind. In the most basic game mode, you can only make sudden right angle turns and are trapped<br/>with others in an inescapable arena. The last survivor wins.<br/><br/>Focus is firmly on online play. Pick a server that sounds fun from the server browser, hop in, stay and play there for as long as you like with the same people. Online, you will find many variations of the core gameplay principle. There are other objectives than mere survival. In Fortress Mode, two teams face each other. Each team owns a Fortress Zone and needs to defend it while trying to conquer the enemy team's Fortress. In Sumo Mode, everyone needs to stay inside a shrinking circle to stay alive.<br/><br/>The game supports custom maps (sadly without an editor) and just about every gameplay variable can be tweaked to your, or more likely, the server owner's heart's content. Speed, map size, trail length and timeouts are just the start. Even the rigid right angle turn rule can be bent!<br/><br/>Retroycles is the Steam version of the open source game Armagetron Advanced, the almost only game of its kind to stay a bit relevant for twenty years.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li> Offline singleplayer against bots<br/></li><li> Splitscreen multiplayer for up to four players<br/></li><li> Online multiplayer for at least 16 players per server, servers can provide more slots<br/></li><li> Four builtin game modes: Last Man Standing, Last Team Standing, Fortress and Sumo<br/></li><li> Modded servers online also provide Racing, Capture the Flag and Mazes. And there is this one strange server with Rogue-ish RPG elements.<br/></li><li> Customizable keyboard layout</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:33:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e453881311532a3cf1e1e8a48fae8b6a.jpg", "website": "http://www.armagetronad.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Manuel Moos"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Manuel Moos"], "esrb_rating": null}
