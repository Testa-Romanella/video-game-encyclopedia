{"id": 788552, "slug": "snow-problem-captaind", "name": "Snow Problem (CaptainD)", "name_original": "Snow Problem (CaptainD)", "description": "<p><strong>Snow Problem</strong> is a game in which you collect snow. There are obstacles to stop this being easy of course, so you need to create extra terrain on the game screen to guide the snow to the bottom of the screen. Added some terrain in the wrong place / somewhere that was helpful but isn't any longer? No problem, you can delete it.</p>\n<p>Many levels contain areas that change the colour of the snow, and you will need to collect a certain amount of each colour to complete the level. As you complete levels, more levels unlock for you to play. The full game will have 100 levels. Every level will be tested by the developer to ensure that it is definitely completable, so if you fail, you know it's your own fault! :-)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T15:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01e5c04f769af1abfa89878bb203e0e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
