If you can cause the reactor to overload, is\r\nshould create a dimensional tear large enough for you to escape, but the\r\ntrigger buttons are in some alien language. There must be clues nearby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Meanwhile enemies\r\nhave locked on to your position and are warping in to finish what they started\r\nand take you out. Scans indicate the more enemies warp in, the more strain\r\nadded to the reactor keeping this pocket together. If the reactor fails, the\r\npocket will collapse and all within will cease to exists. You have to take them\r\nout before their numbers grow to large.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you survive long\r\nenough to find your way out before its too late?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD Keys</p>\n<p>Spacebar to fire</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/87937afeb52ccbcd03d836dba92a35e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kpable"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
