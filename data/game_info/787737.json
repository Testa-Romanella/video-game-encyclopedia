As a tester, you need to complete the cracking of the case under the rules of the system. The cracking process of the case is very similar to the real police case. The cases in the system are all actually happened in Chicheng and are stored in the form of key clues. Each clue contains information about the clues. You need to constantly find new clues by looking at the information and fragment the clues. The content pieced together the completed case in your mind and reasoned out the course of the case. As long as you answer the correct questions about the case in the system, you can even crack a case. After cracking the case, you can view the criminal\u2019s \u201ccriminal statement\u201d.<br/><br/><br/>In the process of cracking the case, you sometimes need to perform special operations on some clues, such as inferring the motives of the characters to complete the \"search warrant\" for the clues of the characters, and inferring a reasonable time to \"invoke the monitoring\" to check and reason out After the correct password of the encryption clue is \"decoded\", the encrypted content can be viewed and so on. The more user-friendly design is that when you have no clue, you can ask the system for help. The system will give you a certain range of tips, but a certain amount of investigative points will be deducted.<br/>After you have solved all the cases, Chicheng police will give your final evaluation based on the detection points and your performance.<br/><h3>Thanks</h3>Thanks to Ge Meiling, Shen Yongliang, Wang Xun, GT, and Chaochao for their help in the game production process, thank you family for your understanding and support, thank all friends who helped test and promote, thank all players!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T19:25:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a3bc42829ba0ceefb4fe5d37cd87b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 26, "beaten": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SHUO LI"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieArk"], "esrb_rating": null}
