Normally, this concept applies with 2D games, but I thought it might be fun to take things one step further. Unfortunately, I only had the weekend to do any work on this and I found quickly that there was more potential here than I had time to deliver on in that time. Consider this a proof of concept. Leave a comment if you'd like to see this expanded it.\u00a0Maybe I'll revisit it sometime after my current side-project, although I'll probably try to riff on Faith by Airdorf instead if I try the whole 1-D horror thing again.</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>-Move: Left/Right Arrow Keys or A/D Keys</p>\n<p>-Use Camera: Z or Space</p>\n<p>-Open Doors: Z or Space</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>Options</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>The menu icons from left to right:</p>\n<p>-Turn off lighting</p>\n<p>-Reduce height of game line</p>\n<p>-Stretch height of game line</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>Mechanics</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>-Ghosts will take more damage and knockback if they are closer to you<br/></p>\n<p>-A dialog will play once all ghosts are cleared in a room</p>\n<p>-Locked doors can be opened if you find corresponding keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T10:15:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dc/3dc4f11b5a1fded4243da3e397d85fca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enchessency"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
