Themed to glam metal band M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, it features three of their songs: \"Dr. Feelgood\", \"Live Wire\" and \"Home Sweet Home\".</p>\n<p>The game's prototype name was Twisted Flipper. The producer of the game, Richard Robbins, initially pursued the name \"Headbanger Ball,\" but MTV balked at a license and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was added relatively late in development.</p>\n<p>This game was designed by two people who previously worked on pinball games: Mark Sprenger (artist for such games as Space Shuttle (1984), High Speed (1986) and Diner (1990) and Brian L. Schmidt (composer for Space Station, Black Knight 2000 and various pinball games by Data East Pinball/Sega Pinball (now Stern Pinball, Inc.).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65e4288eb4fd2197f4b3f5954c68f16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["NuFX"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
