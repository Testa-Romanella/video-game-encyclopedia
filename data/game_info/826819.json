{"id": 826819, "slug": "wicked-games", "name": "Wicked Games", "name_original": "Wicked Games", "description": "The protagonist is Adan Kaider, a sinner who has ended up in Hell.<br/><br/>After being in the place of punishment for three years, he became obsessed with one single thought: to get out of here as soon as possible.<br/>Finally, after a long wait and demanding work, he had the opportunity not just to gain freedom. Adan got his hands on a lucky ticket with a cover on it that states: \"Ticket to Paradise\". Unknowingly, the hero doomed himself to many trials, which will not only test his character, but also transform him beyond recognition.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll face many surprises, mentally trying decisions, various locations and dialogues with interesting characters.<br/>Also, you\u2019ll see a large number of Hell representatives: sinners who are leading a wretched existence of disenfranchised slaves; demons who represent the local prissy elite, raising themselves above the rest; and forgiven, people who didn\u2019t approve themselves during their mortal life and got a chance to do it here, in Hell.<br/><br/>What we have (and what we plan to make):<br/><br/><ul><li>1. Quests based on social interactions, with the mechanics of dialogues and decision-choices that determine not only the attitude of the characters towards you, but also the final ending.<br/></li><li>2. Unique and radically different locations (both in ideas and ways of playing).<br/></li><li>3. Various gameplay mechanics that diversify the gaming experience.<br/></li><li>4. Authorial designed soundtracks.<br/></li><li>5. Original voice acting in Russian.<br/></li><li>6. A wide variety of characters you can (and should) interact with.<br/></li><li>7. Deep universe with its own history and problems.<br/></li><li>8. And,surely, a lot of humor!<br/></li></ul>That will be free to download and play the game for the duration of the development process.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Due to the current situation in the international field (sanctions against Russia), we are not able to get funds from Steam directly.<br/>You can join our socail networks pages (all links are stated in the info and the community page).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T05:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b6efb344f32ceca72118ffed98aafd.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/sibcatteam", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SibCatTeam"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SibCatTeam"], "esrb_rating": null}
