Choose one of four \n      friends to tag along and offer advice when you need it. Further \n      enhancing the experience is the fact that you'll be presented with a \n      slew of interactions with random casino patrons. Be careful though, your \n      choices in these situations could either get you closer to the millions \n      of dollars you're after, or cost you a pile of that hard-earned cash.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
