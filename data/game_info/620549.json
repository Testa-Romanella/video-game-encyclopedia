You can manipulate the yellow object in each game.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Left/Right arrow keys to move, rotate or adjust the yellow object<br/>R to restart the game from the very beginning<br/>Escape to close the program</p>\n<p>This game has been made in 48 hours to GMTK Jam 2021. A solo project for fun.</p>\n<p>The jam's theme 'joined together' inspired me to choose simple machines, which connect objects by transferring\u00a0mechanical force:</p>\n<p>Adjust the pivot of the lever to balance weights.<br/>Rotate a wheel around to aim a cannon or move a platform carrying cannons.<br/>Add weight to one side of a pulley to lift a box on the other side.<br/>Adjust the inclination of a surface to balance a rolling weight or help a rolling object to a higher place.<br/>Position a wedge between close objects to separate them.<br/>Turn a screw to lift up an object.</p>\n<p>If you complete all minigames without losing all lives the game starts over faster, and you can try and get a high score. The game does not register scores.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65e0bc1ff76f810386c31887251b5aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G\u00e1bor Urb\u00e1n"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
