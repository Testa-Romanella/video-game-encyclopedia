It's your job to clean the place up, and find out what's going on deep in this facility as you make your way down to the basement. Progress through the floors by finding the keycards the scientists have left behind, and fight your way through the increasingly bizarre monsters but make sure to keep any eye on your ammo. Thanks for playing our first 3d game! The game was made entirely by Trusty and Cheeks using the Unity game engine. All game models were made from scratch in Blender. The game plays best as a download and we recommend downloading the game to avoid any webgl bugs that weren't able to be fixed. We really appreciate all feeback and comments!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>LMB to shoot</p>\n<p>RMB to melee\u00a0</p>\n<p>E to interact</p>\n\n<p>4/28* Fixed an issue where some players couldn't make it off the elevator due to collider issues.</p>\n<p>Note: Only windows build fully tested.
