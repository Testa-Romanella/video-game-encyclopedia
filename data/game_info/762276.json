To do this you must always have troops in play. If you finish a turn without any troops in play you lose the game.</p>\n<p>You gain more troops by playing them from your hand and drawing more cards. Drawing cards and playing cards costs you gold which you need to mine by playing peasants.<br/><br/><strong>Combat</strong></p>\n<p>Combat works by each side having 2 rows. The back row and the front row. The back row has ranged units that can only be attacked by other ranged units.</p>\n<p>Front row units are your typical melee units which damage each other when they fight.</p>\n<p>If a player has no front row units then their back row units can be attacked like front row units.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T14:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7c4c3e3b01b0e34bd197e997576b24b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wil Taylor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
