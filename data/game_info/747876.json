I'm sorry about that.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is a project currently being worked on by myself using the \u00a0CopperCube 6 engine.\u00a0Right now only the basics of game play are implemented in it. That means you will fall into the water and get stuck since its an earlier alpha version of the game.\u00a0\u00a0I used stock graphics included with the CopperCube software and terrain generator. I'll try to get the sources of the game put up when closer to completion, hopefully. Let me know what you think of it so far. Currently it can run on all platforms including mobile, but I didn't add in touch controls yet. If you have any problems or issues, let me know in the comments. Also, I'll see about adding the original project files(source code) for\u00a0the game.\u00a0Thanks! And have fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or arrows to control character. Shift to run and space to jump.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game requirements are pretty low. A celeron and integrated intel graphics should run this game just fine. CopperCube, the engine used to make this is somewhat easier on hardware.</p>\n<p>Game Credits:</p>\n<p>Game programmer and developer: bhgamerstudio</p>\n<p>Graphics and other visual assets by: Ambiera (the developer of CopperCube)</p>\n<p>Audio: Pulled from youtube's free audio\u00a0library(might have to change it at some point)</p><p>Powered by Copperlight web-based game engine and made in Coppercube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T13:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08b/08ba43097b3cd3957f62ff178eeda256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bhgamerstudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
