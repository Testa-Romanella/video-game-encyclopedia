Clearing a group of blocks counts as clearing a line, with the score scaling based on the number of blocks in the group.</p>\n<p>Chain reactions start a combo multiplier, which resets at the end of the chain. Chains give more points than simply clearing lines.</p>\n<p>Speed increases with lines cleared. <br/></p>\n<p>No advanced Tetris scoring is present (e.g. back-to-backs, T-spins, etc.).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9ef40ca34bbe482f9079636b6699344a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["alchemical"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
