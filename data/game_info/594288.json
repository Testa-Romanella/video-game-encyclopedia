So if you want your super-duper cool OC in my small little game, DM\u00a0me on Discord or Twitter and maybe they'll make it in!</p>\n<p>If you can, provide pixel art and maybe walking, crouching and jumping animations of them since i'm not very good at pixel art myself. But a drawing or image of them is required ofc</p>\r\n- Next Update -\r\n<p>I don't know what will be on the next update but... Here's some stuff i wanna add!</p>\n<ul><li>More levels ofc!</li><li>Multiplayer!</li><li>A second part for Level 2</li><li>Character Selection Menu (As mentioned before)</li><li>Better Touch Controls</li><li>More settings</li><li>Cutscenes!</li><li>Full Controller support! (Cus right now it only works on levels)</li><li>Story Mode! (This one will take some time tho)</li></ul>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this small little game and thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T08:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328e9d4656b052235be1b705b3fb5b64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["GazeShell"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
