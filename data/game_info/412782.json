I've been working on it for a couple months and am very happy with the result so far. There is however still a long way to go and maybe some of you want to follow the development process.</p>\n<p>The game is about a man stranded on a deserted island with no possessions whatsoever. The goal is to escape the island and to figure out how to do this. The island is riddled with many secrets, events, animals and npc's to interact with. The player has to discover the island and while doing this also survive. It will be difficult to find warmth, food and water every day while also protecting yourself from the many threats on the island.</p>\n<p>The trailer shown above doesn't cover even close to what I've been working on in the last months. I've been putting out progress video's on my youtube channel. So here are some links.</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIS8hi4sDmKVFkcn9PXQbLA</li><li>Discord:\u00a0discord.gg/nC7aA43</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/thomassu04</li></ul>\n<p>Here is one of those progress videos</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T03:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc4c829c98e03436d2c0574c34b20da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thomassu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
