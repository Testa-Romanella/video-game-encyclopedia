It triggers skills to attack the enemy by finding the same character. The cards are divided into left and right areas. One card is randomly issued in the right area, and eight cards are randomly issued in the left area. Then the cards in the left area are covered. Players need to use memory to find the same card as the card in the right area. Finding the correct card can launch an attack on the succubus, and if it is wrong, it will be attacked by the succubus. The combat method is a turn-based battle. After the battle is won, you can get the buff of random attribute growth, and of course you will also get the exquisite CG picture reward. Defeat all kinds of succubus to become stronger and get more rewards! ~", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/677b56a6480dea97d6507378573ae766.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SW Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SW Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
