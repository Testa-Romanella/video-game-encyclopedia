These humans bring various tasty food treats that you covet.</p>\n<p>You command local wildlife units to help you obtain these treats and bring them back to your den. Be careful to not let your units get caught by the human campers, however, or they will run away (as they should!)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move Camera - WASD</p>\n<p>Select Unit - Left Click</p>\n<p>Deselect - Left Click Selected Unit</p>\n<p>Move Unit - Right Click</p>\n<p>Units:</p>\n<p>Squirrel - Can move very quickly to get to where the food is. Carrying food, however, slows it down so plan ahead.</p>\n<p>Raccoon - Slower than the squirrel, but gets a greedy boost when it grabs food.Really nervous around humans, it will freeze if spotted by one, so be careful planning an escape route that's free of prying eyes.</p>\n<p>Black flies - Are the human campers too good at guarding their food? Send in a cloud of these to distract them so your other units have an easier time getting food. Be careful, though, because a camper will use bug spray if he sees them, so you'll have to be sneaky</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:15:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c07/c0717f1bd15918f89d98d04d34f2eae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Nielsen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
