The development may take a while as I can only do this so long as I have free time to dedicate to it. I made this mostly to show case the skills I learned about game development and 3D\u00a0modelling and animation. This project\u00a0gave me reasons to learn more techniques and efficient work practices\u00a0in these fields. E-mail me your comments and suggestions if you can, it will truly be a great help! Also follow me here on itch.io, I will post weekly updates and progress to the development.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> leonardo.regalado9@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db7d9c2881ff4723fb0f126e610bdb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["LeonDojima"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
