Initially, they're simple (and fun) spring-loaded pistols, but if you shoot well, you can evolve them.<br/>In front of you is a balloon distributor which, according to your choice, will distribute 4 to 6 different balloons, you load them into your guns using your triggers.<br/>Toys are routed to large bins located right in front of you via large wheels and treadmills that accelerate steadily.<br/>Each balloon is associated with a toy. For example, at level 2, the \"Soy Sauce\" balloon is associated with the \"Sushi\" toy, the \"Ketchup\" balloon with the \"Hamburger\" toy.<br/><strong> Your mission [/] is to grab the correct balloon and shoot the corresponding toy before it falls into the trash.<br/><br/>There are 5 different levels that appeal to popular culture (more levels to come):<br/>1 gambling, 2 sauces, 3 cinema, 4 musicians, 5 video games.<br/><br/>But beware ! Enemies are lurking and will try to stop you.<br/><br/>Chain together multiple combos, shots and speed accuracy to achieve the highest score.</strong></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T03:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/548dfe6b1b1821831ef5d365c0326f4a.jpg", "website": "https://microbegames.com/pops", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Microbe Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Microbe Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
