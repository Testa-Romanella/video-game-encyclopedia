The idea for the game is for it to be kind of like Terraria or The Legend of Zelda except to get to new areas you have to fly to them in your rocketship. Right now I\u00a0just have 2 planets you can land on and nothing really to do there, but I\u00a0wanted to see if anyone thought this concept would even be fun. Also the transition when you go from the overworld map to each planet is really janky because each planet has a flat tilemap to play on an a circular version that you can orbit and your rotation and velocity has to be converted between the two.\u00a0I thought maybe someone would know how to fix that, I'm not good at math. Anyways, thanks for checking it out! :)</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>stand in front of the rocket and click it to get on</p>\n<p>A and D turn the rocket, Space controls the engine</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel - when in space this zooms the camera in and out</p>\n<p>Up and down arrow keys - these control the speed of time. The current speed is in the top left corner.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0e8ef6acc0c899d96e92b28cda40153.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["redstonecreeper8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
