{"id": 146652, "slug": "rogueboy", "name": "RogueBoy", "name_original": "RogueBoy", "description": "<p>RogueBoy is a Game Boy inspired stylized roguelike created for the #gbjam on GameJolt. <br/><br/>RogueBoy is alone. He is prisoner. In order to escape, he needs to find the Gem. Help him do so.</p><p>Press Z to start and go through the intro screens.</p><p>The game controls are simple:</p><p>UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: move</p><p>Press Z: guard</p><p>Release Z: attack</p><p>Attacks fire bullets in four directions. The enemies will attack you similarly. Each enemy has a resistance and needs a certain number of hits to be killed, ranging from 1 (Slime) to 5 (Lich).</p><p>Getting hit while guarded makes you lose one heart. Getting hit while unguarded is GAME OVER (losing all hearts is also game over, of course). </p><p>There are powerups to heal you, and swords that will raise your level. Killing enemies can raise your level too - with a probability depending on the enemy's strength. Leveling up will make you faster and will make your attacks reach longer. Trust me, you'll need it.</p><p>The Gem is in a room at random. The World is 10x10 rooms big. You might luck out and find it immediately. But don't count on it. </p><p>Useless to say, death is permanent and irreversible.</p><p>Prepare... to die.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f845530a99a0e0f09bb2754bbc798f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gan_HOPE326"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
