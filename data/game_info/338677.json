You aren't gonna let a lil thing like being stuck in Hell stop you are you?</p>\n<p>Let's make some GOLD!</p>\n<p>Click your way to riches! Who knows what will happen!?</p>\n\n\n<p>Ok, but for reals, Dungeon Tycoon is a clicker/idle/rpg set in Hell. It starts off as a clicker, giving you full control, then, as you purchase upgrades, the characters will begin to do the work for you. Later on, more gameplay elements will be unlocked.\u00a0This game is being made by one person and is about 5 days into development (04/07/19). Updates will be added to the DevLog below!
