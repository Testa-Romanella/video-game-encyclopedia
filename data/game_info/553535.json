The ball will bounce around the screen and it is your job to make sure that the ball doesn't get past you. On the right side of the board is an opponent paddle. The opponent is pretty good at this but only as fast as you are. Every time the ball bounces, whether it be off the wall or a paddle, the bounce counter at the bottom of the screen will increment. The higher the bounce counter, the faster the ball moves. Once the ball makes it past either the player or the opponent, the bounce counter and speed reset.\u00a0\u00a0At the top of the screen is a scoreboard for each player. The game is endless so the only challenge for the player is to see how high the bounce counter can get or their score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4e8b1aa1542a99f1cee019142cfb584.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoerassicPark"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
