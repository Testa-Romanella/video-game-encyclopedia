(You also lose if you have more actions to use than cards in your hand).</p>\n<p>*NOTE 1* Card abilities have been transferred to symbols. To read what a card does, right click hold on that card to have a larger version of it pop up.<br/></p>\n<p>*NOTE 2*: This is a very early prototype, so expect their to be bugs aplenty. I will be attempting to update the game regularly, at least until May 12th. Graphical improvements will probably not occur until at least May 1st.</p>\n<p><strong>*Other Rules (Found in the Program Manual to the left in the game)*</strong></p>\n<p>There are two basic resources:</p>\n<p>- Energy: Used to play cards, cards with + Energy only increase that Energy the first time they are played.</p>\n<p>-$: Used to buy cards, cards with + $ increase your $ every turn that they are in your program.</p>\n<p>You can click/double-click a card, turning its edges blue, to select it. If a card cannot be selected this way, it is not a playable card at the given moment.\u00a0Press\u00a0ENTER\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0a\u00a0selected\u00a0card.</p>\n<p>BASE cards have an energy cost of 0, and when played, their effects occur immediately, and they go into your Base.
