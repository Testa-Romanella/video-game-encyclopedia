Here are the rules:</strong></p>\n<p>1. WASD to move blue.</p>\n<p>2. IJKL to move red (IN 2 PLAYER ONLY).</p>\n<p>3. Try to survive without touching any of the lines, and use teamwork.</p>\n<p>4. Many people have been confused by this so I will say this again. DO NOT GO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE DIRECTION YOU WERE JUST GOING OR THE GAME WILL RESTART.</p>\n<p>5. If you touch your line (or the other players lines in two player), the game will then automatically restart, so good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fd3e31f5a8b24801d0c70d381ed5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coderam"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
