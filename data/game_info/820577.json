The curse not only makes you fight but determines the power of your attack with a dice!</p>\n<p>You press the dice above the head of your character and the random number determines how much damage you will do to your opponent.The opponent does that too and you take turns to determine this luck based fight!</p>\n<p>Game made for the GMTK2022 game jam. Theme was roll of the dice.</p>\n<p>This is the first game jam game I was able to finish and I am pretty happy with the end result!Tho there are a lot of things that can be improved.</p>\n<p>P.S. the audio for the hit on the enemy knight sometimes doesn't play for some reason though its rare. If it annoys you restarting the game fixes it.</p>\n\n<p>Battle music -\u00a0\"Showdown of Misdeeds\" Composed by Jonathan Shaw (www.jshaw.co.uk)</p>\n<p>End music -\u00a0Otto Halm\u00e9n</p>\n<p>Hit effects -\u00a0Philippe Groarke \u00a0\u00a0tarfmagougou</p>\n<p>Grunts and death sound - Ivan Danev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:09:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83b34af31c882738212d08d472601f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
