Flip boxes with [Q], destroy bananas with [W], or if the item is already an upright box move to the next object with [E]. An X will appear over the item you currently have selected. Once you apply an action to an item you cannot come back to that item. The speed will increase as the game goes on. I know its not anything special, but hey its free and in-browser so whatever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6d26a799150dd8a3f2c4f22b23fa67d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KanyeWeeeest"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
