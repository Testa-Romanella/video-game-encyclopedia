The objective was to create\u00a0a prototype based on an old Assassin's Creed\u00a0game, with\u00a0<strong>improved gameplay and\u00a0 graphics</strong>.\r\n  </p>\n<p>We chose <strong>Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</strong> as the main reference for this prototype. Some features were modified or added, inspired by\u00a0those present in\u00a0the latest\u00a0Assassins\u2019 Creed games (Unity, Syndicate, Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla).\r\n  </p>\n<p>You will find <strong>some bugs and many imperfections</strong>. <br/>Keep in mind that this\u00a0is a school project, and we didn't have the time to finish it properly.\u00a0We would have liked to improve some parts of the prototype like the AI, the assassination system, the parkour or the cinematic system.</p>\n<p>It was made by passionate team members and some\u00a0big fans of Assassin's Creed, who did their best to offer you\u00a0the best<strong>\u00a0Assassin's Creed</strong>\u00a0experience possible. We hope you will enjoy our work.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nCORE TEAM\r\nPRODUCER\r\n<p>Aur\u00e9lien Thazet</p>\r\nLEAD PROGRAMMER\r\n<p>Antin\u00e9a Gontard </p>\r\nPROGRAMMERS\r\n<ul><li>Adeline Delbecq | Stealth system</li><li>Antin\u00e9a Gontard | Parkour system</li><li>Aur\u00e9lien Thazet | UI &amp; Sound systems</li></ul>\r\nARTISTS\r\n<ul><li>Louis Billoir | Technical Artist</li><li>Lucas Payet | Environment Artist</li><li>Nicolas Perrot | Rigger &amp; Skinner</li><li>Tommy Te | Character Artist</li></ul>\r\nEXTERNAL TEAMS\r\nPLAYLAB\r\n<ul><li>Th\u00e9o Bertrand | Communication Manager</li><li>Simon Dos Santos | Communication Manager</li><li>Louise Knoery | Project Manager</li><li>Maureen Richermoz | UX Designer</li></ul>\r\nARTISTS\r\n<ul><li>Quentin Osmani | Character Artist</li><li>Robin Villier | Rigger &amp; Skinner</li></ul>\r\nASSASSIN'S CREED EXPERIENCE - YOUTUBE CHANNEL\r\n<ul><li>Maxime Anot</li><li>Maxime Nicolas</li><li>Aur\u00e9lien Thazet</li><li>Valentin Thieullet</li></ul>\r\nASSETS\r\nUNREAL MARKETPLACE\r\n<ul><li>Dark Medieval Environment Megapack</li><li>Fantasy and Medieval Architecture Kit</li><li>Frank Stealth Kill</li><li>Real Fire Pack 2d Effect Pack</li><li>Ultimate Traversal Anims</li></ul>\r\nMUSICS\r\n<ul><li>Assassin's Creed Outlaw - Unofficial Theme - Malte Wegmann</li><li>Solomon's Temple - Jesper Kyd / Ubisoft Music</li><li>Acre Underworld - Jesper Kyd / Ubisoft Music</li></ul>\r\nSOUNDS\r\n<ul><li>Sounds from many Assassin's Creed games - Ubisoft All Rights Reserved</li><li>Sounds from freesound.org</li></ul>\r\nSCHOOL\r\n<p>Thanks to Lyon Ynov Campus</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:40:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bef23dd1a7b8058dc00824d3d614bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AurePixel", "FrozenFs"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
