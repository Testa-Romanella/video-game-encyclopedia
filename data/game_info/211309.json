If you don't feel like this is safe, don't play on Public Play or host a lobby.</li><li>The macOS version of this game isn't well tested. Use at your own risk.</li></ul>\n<p>You can visit the game's webpage up on\u00a0my website. It has an FAQ and a tutorial. I highly recommend you read both.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859cfc65e2fb47a1e604676ebaa5a712.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ErrorAtLine0"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
