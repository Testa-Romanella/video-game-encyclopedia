Focussing on a dragon battle encounter, we quickly discovered during play testing that a continuous loop of dragon battles was rather fun.</p>\n<p>Thus was born Dragon Battle, an early release of The Janayana and stand-alone mini-game.</p>\n<p>Choose a player class -- Fighter, Knight, Wizard or Ninja -- and hone your skills in the arena! Unlock\u00a0new spells, solve riddles,\u00a0purchase armor, weapons and magic items, and battle\u00a0increasingly tough dragons.</p>\n<p><em>** Post your high score in the comments below! **</em></p>\n<p>All music is original and\u00a0custom written for the game.</p>\n<p>Dragon graphic is modified from the original\u00a0by Sharm at OpenGameArt.org (https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-enemies-11-dragons,\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/sharm)</p>\n<p>Dragon Battle is a work-in-progress as we continue to tweak the battle system over the next few weeks. Additionally, we anticipate launching a few updates as we include more interesting dragons!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy &amp; please leave any feedback/comments.</p>\n<p><em>** We want to make this game better. Give us\u00a0feedback! **</em></p>\n<p>The full game, The Janayana, remains in active development. With a large game world to explore and many quests to solve (not to mention incarnations to live!), The Janayana should be an engrossing journey for players taking months to solve.\u00a0Anticipating\u00a0release in 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:02:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/132e77a41f0b4f4436809e401580b927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Apartment 18 Productions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
