First, you would just need to collect huge amounts of data about millions of cats and learn how to apply real Machine Learning to it. Simply follow these steps on your way to a scientific breakthrough:<br/><br/><ul><li>Renovate an abandoned factory on Mars<br/></li><li>Design and automate production chains<br/></li><li>Produce and sell exquisite goods to cats<br/></li><li>Collect and analyze data with Machine Learning<br/></li><li>Scale and make the factory more efficient<br/></li><li>Get deeper into real Machine Learning and cats</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Didn't we tell you it's a piece of cake? And after that, you might start thinking of building an R&amp;D department, hire a cat scientist, and research more complicated machinery to produce more complicated goods? Or maybe turn Mars into one giant cat studying factory? Oh wait, it\u2019s already happening\u2026 Engineering is always absorbing! Especially if it\u2019s about cats.<br/><br/><strong>The game is backed up with real Machine Learning, links to handpicked educational videos, and an in-game wiki to be used as learning material.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-21T09:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75d8acad7c369ef55112efb92ad600cf.jpg", "website": "https://luden.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 108, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Luden.io"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nival", "Luden.io"], "esrb_rating": null}
