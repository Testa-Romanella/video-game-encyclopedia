There you'll find an amazing rural pipeline scene, where the user can demonstrate an understanding of Spot Sample Witnessing - using the Purge, Fill &amp; Empty Method. But only after checking and verifying the pipeline system pressure. Also, there's a duplicate scene with a totally different pipeline system pressure that will require a different number of purges, for a proper sample collection.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T22:56:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6a0cfb010501e5bd6f243154fc642f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrick Kelley, CIT"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kelley Integrity Safety Solutions", "Endless Simulations"], "esrb_rating": null}
