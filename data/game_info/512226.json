But seemed to get a working prototype.</p>\n<p>The Cube is a puzzle platformer with a few twisits and turns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have 300 seconds to find your way out of the cube with the help of GF101.</p>\n<p>GF101, has gravity force ability. This enables him to\u00a0 move objects on command, to aid possible escape.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Movement - WASD<br/>Look - Mouse<br/>Jump - Space Bar<br/>Interact - E<br/>Gravity Force On(pick up) - Left Mouse Button<br/>Gravity Force Off (drop) - Right Mouse Button<br/>P - Pause</p>\n<p>NOTE: This has been released with a few know glitches, but is 100% possible to complete.
