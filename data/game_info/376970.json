At a pivotal moment however you get yourself into trouble which force you to move, beginning a new chapter in your life and brings us to where the story begins. I worked hard on the personality of characters and the emotional aspect of the relationships between people in the game world. The sexual life of the main character hasn't been forgotten either however. All of the scenes are written in a vivid and descriptive manner, and are strengthened by good visuals. You will meet several different characters in the game, all with different personalities.<br/><br/><strong>Game features:</strong><br/>- A number of parallel, evolving story lines<br/>- Beautiful graphics<br/>- Animated sex scenes<br/>- 17 endings based on your choices.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T19:50:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06db81370b42c09b663e76ebd63d66f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 49, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Novel"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Novel"], "esrb_rating": null}
