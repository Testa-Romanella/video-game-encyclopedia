Click, hold, drag the mouse, release, and watch\u00a0 your sala-er, I mean, belongings get tossed. Fairly jittery/buggy,\u00a0 which is perfect!\u00a0Tip - a quick click and flick is best for tossing the items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was done during my girlfriend and I's first game jam, Extra Credits Game Jam\u00a0#3.\u00a0 The theme was <strong>cycles\u00a0</strong>and washing machine was all I\u00a0could think of. So we went with that.\u00a0We started late past the 50 hour mark out of the allotted 100 hours of Jam. Because of this, we finished it a little late and couldn't submit it.\u00a0But I\u00a0guess that's what happens when you start\u00a0late. For the most part, we are glad it turned out how it did.\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>My girlfriend is also a\u00a0beginner 3D modeler, so I figured we'd give this a whirl to toughen up her skills! And also toughen up my bad Unity Skillz.</p>\n<p>Because this was a game I intended to be worked on only during the game jam, this won't really be updated unless there's a game breaking bug or if I\u00a0can fix the jittering when holding items.\u00a0I might also upload the assets on my\u00a0GITHUB if you're interested one day.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, there's no sounds. I ran out of time, and I ain't got time fo' dat.</p>\n<p>You might get dizzy when playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a796df52f41d25eaa8e06919c4a9827e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["therealdrew"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
