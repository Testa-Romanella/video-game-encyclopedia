SoulEye, is having a nice day when suddenly\r\nthe ship's navigational systems goes astray. He and his crew mates are\r\nviolently thrown into a huge dimensional vortex and everything fades to black.</p><p>When he awakes, everything around him seems strange. It's as if the world around\r\nhim and himself became blurred, square-ish and kinda... pixelated.</p><p>That's when he finds himself on a very familiar situation...</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>The game mechanic is the same as VVVVVV: you can walk around but\r\ncannot jump. Instead, you can flip gravity and fall upward to the ceiling\r\n(or downward to the floor if you're already on the ceiling).</p><p>When you die (either by touching spikes or enemies), you go back to a\r\nnearby checkpoint.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\n\r\nkey\r\naction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArrow Keys, WASD\r\nMove\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace, z, x\r\nAction\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter, ESC\r\nPause\r\n\r\n\r\nShift\r\nWalk slowly", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/3059aa74d62a3f01392193573edbac4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alexdantas"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
