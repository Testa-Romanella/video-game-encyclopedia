I tried to\u00a0ID the\u00a0best position and\u00a0settings\u00a0to capture everything well.\u00a0 The camera adjustments are decidedly challenging for me at this point.\u00a0 Seems like I have\u00a0\u00a0to change the view frequently while working which throws off my reference to\u00a0the game view which confuses me.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for viewing.</p>\n<p>Created by Popliteus\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T09:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fefbeaf5b29e7f6a381ef63cbbdff74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Popliteus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
