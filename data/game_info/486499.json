Sure! Take a look at the included levels by running Cary.exe with the command line argument --dump-levels and open them in your favourite text editor <strong>\u2014 </strong>use a monospace font so it displays correctly. Then just write your own and open them with Cary.exe (you can open multiple files at once) and so on.
