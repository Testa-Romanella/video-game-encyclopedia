Collect the batted balls and return them to the machine. Keep your money above $0 for as many pitches as possible! Buy new machines to quickly add to your pitch count, but be careful, each pitch costs you $5. Every 10 pitches, a new customer comes and pays $60, $75,\u00a0 or $100 to use the slow, medium, or fast machines!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c142059d798076c5c247350b83a6341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["starfishrobot"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
