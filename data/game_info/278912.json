Your health equals your stamina and your ammo.</p>\n<p>The simple goofy story is that you are a \"Wanna-Be-Santa\" kept in a dungeon full of Grinch-Monsters. Your goal is to get out of there with as many gifts as possible. And also you use the gifts as ammo to defend your self. And sometimes you throw out some gifts to sprint. When you have killed all the enemies your skill is rated by a grade from A(wesome good) to F(*ckin bad). If you go to school you probably are familair with this rating system. More levels are Coming Soon!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, LEFT-MOUSE to shoot, SHIFT to sprint, hold SPACE to restart game from gameover-screen/failed-screen<br/></p>\n<p>If you are lucky you can find a hidden beach ball and a blue marking \"S7\". Have fun!</p>\n<p>Bugs I turned into Game Mechanics: Enemies can kill themselves when they touch each other. This turned out to be a great game mechanic. You can trick you enemies to colliding into each other and kill themselves.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38dff9a4b88663e98b755fe4486d614a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["morfy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
