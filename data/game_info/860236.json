When you start the game your are asked to relax (for about 1.5 minutes*). This is important for every apnea diver to completely self focus. This is your descend time to the lowest point you've ever been. So, Relax.</p>\n<p>When the white block appears on the screen\u00a0you reached the target of your descend. You are pumped with endorphins and happy feelings but\u00a0the tightness of your lungs is real.</p>\n<p>When you are ready then\u00a0press the fire button (Joystick port 2)\u00a0to start your ascend journey and use the control\u00a0to leave as many bubbles behind at the exit point\u00a0as possible.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is no counter, and there is no goal. It is just you and yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* ATTENTION:\u00a0</strong>When you start the game it will take approximately 1.5 Minutes! until the game can be played. The reason is that it precalculates the bubble animation\u00a0with some sin/cos magic which takes a good while in V2\u00a0BASIC. Sorry for the wait. If you play on VICE Emulator then I suggest you use the WARP mode until the white block is being displayed on screen.</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in one day\u00a0as part of the Bodensee GameJam 2022 (https://itch.io/jam/bodensee-gamejam-2022).\u00a0The topics to choose from\u00a0were:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Enge (narrowness)\r\n</li><li>time shift\r\n</li><li>deep\r\n</li><li>retro</li></ul>\n<p>I think I managed to\u00a0hit three of them :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T13:53:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8ae7a6add23430a7b3b6a3de3e32557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roman Werner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
