To do this, multiple branches were needed since each branch can lead to an end or another route. I specifically chose this structure because I thought it would be the most efficient at telling the story, and it forces\u00a0the player to be involved. The structure contributes to the experience since\u00a0I want the player to be pushed into making their own choices with the goal that they\u00a0could strive to reach a happy ending, depending on their mood or feelings.</p>\n<p>~~~~~~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/37630be50c7e78b390a5411162e868aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amy V"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
