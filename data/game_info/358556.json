You lose health when you get damaged. Ion is spent when using ion powers: E.M.P. Nova and Cryo Grenades. You can replenish them with health kits and ion kits. You use energy to shoot, evade and block.</p>\n<p>You earn credits(bottom right corner) as you destroy enemy fighters. Spend them on upgrading your ship by returning to the Base Ship (enter by approaching the runway).\u00a0Every minute a base ship is spawned. You can either enter it to upgrade your ship or proceed to the boss battle!</p>\n<p>There are 4 enemy types:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0The Brown Agile Fighters - evade your attacks and shoot back at you!</li><li>\u00a0The Pink Kamikaze - small suicide ships.</li><li>\u00a0The Yellow Rail Ships - fly in formation and have a fixed pattern of attack.</li><li>\u00a0The Green Tanks - large but slow\u00a0bullet sponges that fire heavy bullets.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>When your ship is destroyed, you lose all your credits, but keep your upgrades!
