In contrast to other games where you control your Units with keyboard and mouse, in Tanxy you can write a JavaScript program to control any Unit on your behalf. Although manual control is also possible. Your goal is to destroy all enemy Units and to keep yours.<br/><br/><strong>WHY?</strong> JavaScript is the most popular programming language on this planet. If you have a kid who should be motivated to learn programming, Tanxy could be a good option. If you are a programmer who wants to learn JavaScript with fun, Tanxy is an option, too.<br/><br/><strong>HOW?</strong> You develop Tank control algorithms, you implement them in JavaScript, load them to Tanks and see how they fight.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T02:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362feb050fa88780d125614cdbf4e0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IronRib"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IronRib"], "esrb_rating": null}
