And if you want to test each other in an almost fair environment (Player 1 = Keyboard + Mouse and Player 2 = Gamepad), then there's the VS Mode with items (Hearts) being almost fair to the one picking them up (80% of the time it's something good like healing your character, dealing more damage to your opponent ...and other stuff).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:34:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6f22057e80908bc227163a42d1f87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XXYOTH"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
