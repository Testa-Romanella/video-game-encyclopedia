The game currently features a default player controller, but we plan to include a custom one in future iterations, along with secondary exploration objectives and the ability to fight the cyborgs - whether it's a shooter, melee, or something else is still in the works.\r\n</p>\n<p>We're also working on smarter enemy AI and at least two more levels to keep the excitement going. Use WASD for movement, Space to jump, and Shift to run.\r\n</p>\n<p>Valoris wouldn't be possible without the Unity Asset Store, where we found the bulk of our game assets, which we've customized to fit our game. We'd also like to thank several artists from freesound.org for their soundscapes that are heard in Valoris.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lastly, we owe a special thanks to the creator of the playlist where we got the music for this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Try Valoris now and see if you can outsmart the cyborgs before it's too late!
