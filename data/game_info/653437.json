Influences include Gauntlet, Alien Breed.\u00a0Rage was one of my most accomplished Amiga games. It was signed to be published for a flat fee during development, but as with most of my Amiga titles the company changed their mind as the game neared completion, so I released it as shareware.</p>\n<p>Note that you can hold fire to launch a grenade.<br/></p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da4568d25bce192903a1d530f73a1dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
