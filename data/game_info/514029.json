So you can clearly see that some things such as..... the game itself is underdone to the desired consistency.<br/>The mechanics in the game itself are balancing indicators with a small plot.<br/><br/>What can be distinguished is that in General, the space turned out to be quite good, and even interacts well with the mechanics of the balance of indicators.<br/>But much of it is in need of significant improvements.<br/>Well, the benefit of errors do not climb out, and the game does not crumble.\u00a0<br/><br/>P.S. if you do not have an old calculator. Older PCs may not have the right firewood.<br/><br/>\u00a0At least we managed to make a working demo in the crumbs of time that we had with our experience. Even so, I'm thrilled with what we've done.<br/>We also plan to bring it to mind in the future, as we finish with the normal work on order for another game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T05:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df48a5f96dd1a86d114f5822741c7b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tarmunt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
