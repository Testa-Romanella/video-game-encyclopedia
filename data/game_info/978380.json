Its lush forests, mysterious caves, and majestic buildings have transformed into haunting and dreadful locations. Take your time and explore unknown areas, as each holds a mystery. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat is bread and butter, and you will engage in it easily. Use the unique skills of all of your party members: <br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li>Attack from close range or distance with different attack patterns and directions,\n<br/>\n</li><li>Heal or shield allies with various spells and commands,\n<br/>\n</li><li>Inflict status aliments like damage over time, stun, immobilize, and other elemental effects,\n<br/>\n</li><li>Use your surroundings to use to your advantage or create new ones to separate you from the enemies</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep a keen eye on your equipment and vitality as they both deteriorate over time. A bonfire in Zoria's provides a safe spot to restock your resources and prepare for the next battle.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care of each of your warriors' skill development, and it will repay you on the battlefield. Remember that having an individual with the right skills can get you into previously inaccessible places and quests. It may turn out that interacting with a specific character with various objects in the world of Zoria may lead you to discover hidden treasures or make your travel easier.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to be wise in and out of the battle. You cannot win the game without making progress - this also counts toward your outpost. You may regularly update the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, and by doing so, you will be rewarded with either resources, quests, or items. Different buildings will have different numbers of available upgrades.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will receive what they find along the way. You will also get some of the experience they gain.
