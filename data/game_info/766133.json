Luckily for humanity, he managed to develop a cure. Unluckily for him (yet again), he has to distribute it to the incoming zombies patients who enter his care. As he heals these undead patients, however, the room starts to fill up with the remnants of humanity. And of course there are zombies, so everyone is running around with no sense of direction. Will the doctor manage to cure all the zombies who enter through his doors? Or will the hoard of <strong>healed</strong> patients prove to be too big a problem. Find out in just a few clicks!!!\u00a0</p>Controls are simple:<p>WASD for movement, mouse to aim, and left click to throw bottles. When at the desk, press space to brew bottles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:03:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be0042bd306153b2c549130c8e2e395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["Starr_Fighter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
