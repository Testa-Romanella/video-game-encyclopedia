To change the color of the square, click/Tap you mouse. To gain points, you must change the square's outer color so that it matches the upcoming color from the right. For example, if black is headed your way, you must change your border to black as well. Once you have passed a color though, you are safe to change borders again to a different color. Another way to earn points is by touching the spinning spikes that go left to right. Your border color must match the spike's border color as well. Here's where you need to be careful, because depending on what color the spike is above, you may not be able to see it's border. In the rush of the game, the inner color will then look like a border, leading you to lose. Good luck.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>PS: It's easier if you start off by not bothering about the spikes.</p>\n\n\n<p>Hope I get top 100 on Black and White Jam :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a572502bd9a030625d0d7eaf4b5295e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexLikesMuffins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
