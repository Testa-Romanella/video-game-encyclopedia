I wrote this short bit of interactive fiction as a way to teach myself the Inky scripting tool. So, it's quite a bad game, written without any thought of\u00a0its actual design,\u00a0and ends very abruptly. BUT!\u00a0Maybe it's a fun way to be introduced to the world of TEETH (our fat TTRPG book, to be Kickstarted shortly). Enjoy?</p>\n<p>Save often, as there are a few bugs usually resolved by a reset. Sorry -\u00a0I'm still learning!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T15:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dc99a977d6bb72cb240d4ffa86fd139.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TEETH: A ROLEPLAYING GAME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
