{"id": 15383, "slug": "weird-hero", "name": "Weird Hero", "name_original": "Weird Hero", "description": "Weird Hero is a humorous and challenging shoot'em up where the hero, SuperMegaDude, battles countless foes with his arsenal of weird weapons: the Flickinator, the Atomic Toaster, a magician's hat and other strange devices. <br/><br/>The world around you has gone mad. You're facing cyborgs from the future, giant anime heads (with eye beams, of course) and an unlikely criminal alliance of Australians, Japanese train robbers, Russian telnyashka-wearing suicide bombers and some biker gangs. What could bring such a diverse crowd together? How do the cyborgs fit in? What about the anime heads? What use is the Flickinator? What's going on? <br/><br/><ul><li>Varied Enemy Types <br/>There are eighteen enemy types, including bikers, Australians, samurai, Russian suicide bombers, giant anime heads and cyborgs from the future. Each of these have their own strengths and weaknesses. <br/><br/></li><li>Teeth-Clenching Hardcore: <br/>It's going to be a tough ride. To complete the game, you have to master the weird arsenal, know your enemies' weaknesses by heart and learn to evade a torrent of bricks, bullets and shurikens. <br/><br/></li><li>Weird Weaponry <br/>Seven weapon types, four of which you won't find in any other game. Highlights are the atomic toaster, the magician's hat and the Flickinator. What other game lets you swat enemies aside with a flick of your fingers? <br/><br/></li><li>Exciting Soundtrack <br/>The energizing Psychobilly music by The Beat Devils is a perfect fit for the overall madness and sets the right mood.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-04T18:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb0/eb0e1d168903fbe13180ab12dc1e4f9b.jpg", "website": "https://vk.com/snail_ninja", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 114, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snail-Ninja Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Snail-Ninja Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
