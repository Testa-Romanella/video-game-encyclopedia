Your goal is to try and rack up as many points as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>Be careful leaving it on too long, because you will run out of energy and be <strong>UNABLE </strong>to fire for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Aim your death ray at these:</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> aim at these. They are more fragile, and if you break one, your run is over:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To get some wacky abilities like rapid-fire rockets and target-bouncing lasers, pick up <strong>POWER-UPS</strong> (They will not hit the fake orbs):</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>--Points--</p>\n<p>Points are calculated as follows (in this order):</p>\n<p>1. The faster you smash an orb after it spawns, the more points you get.</p>\n<p>2. Powerups continuously give you points.</p>\n<p>3. Surviving the match until the end of the timer will double your points</p>\n<p>4. There is a randomized threshold of total orb smashes, if you cross it, your number of smashes will be multiplied by 100 and added to your points.</p>\n<p>--Extra--</p>\n<p>Have tons of fun bouncing to dope music and blowing stuff up!</p>\n<p><strong>PRESS ESC</strong> to close the game window when eventually you get tired of the game. Crashing may happen, but is most often a minor issue. Just open the game back up.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:\u00a0</strong>Some PC's might block the application due to its signature being unknown I guess, so if a Windows SmartScreen popup comes up, just press \"more info\" and allow the file to run.</p>\n<p>*All non-music audio created by me within the time of the jam*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:39:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bf0d9992543182107389c7418092400.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["duckeys"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
