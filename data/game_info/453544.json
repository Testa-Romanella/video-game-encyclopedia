However, hidden beneath the issue of police brutality lies a larger web of racial disparities and systematic racism that affects black lives every day.</p>\n<p>This game attempts to illustrate some of these disparities by simulating a series of lives according to the player's choices. Using real data, the game will determine the outcome of chosen events for groups of white people and groups of black people - side by side.\u00a0 As more and more lives are simulated, imbalances that may be hidden at first begin to come forth.</p>\n<p>Systemic Lives will evolve as you play. There is an ending and I hope that you stick around to see it through! <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team Name:</strong> Digital Daydream</p>\n<p><strong>Team Members:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Justin Ray -\u00a0justinaray828@gmail.com</li><li>Josh Altman - joshuaealtman@gmail.com</li><li>John Poe -\u00a0john.poe007@gmail.com</li><li>Matthew Glenn - matthew.mark.glenn@gmail.com</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Name:</strong> Systemic Lives</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNqt2xpo_gTNl2XWMZIyZgAZPl4ZIIG6BxaCUN8AwvI/edit#</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Non-Original Assets used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>VideroBoy\r\nhttps://opengameart.org/content/low-poly-human-male</li></ul>\n<p>If you want to help solve these problems, Please considering donating to Black Lives Matter<br/></p>\n<p>https://blacklivesmatter.com/</p>\r\nFAQ\r\n<p><strong>What\u2019s up with the Black sounding names in your game?</strong></p>\n<p>We did that intentionally.\u00a0 The names selected came from a study on callback rates for resumes based on black sounding names (The National Bureau of Economic Research).\u00a0 It found that people with black sounding names had a callback rate of 50% of people with similar resumes but with white sounding names.\u00a0 We used their list so we could use their stats when building the choice for, \u201cFind a Job.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Some of the results for different lives seem unlikely, how are you building your results?</strong></p>\n<p>We are running these stats individually and not taking into account previous choice responses.\u00a0 For example, finishing high school may make it more likely for someone to find a job after college.\u00a0 But our algorithm doesn\u2019t try to create a true probability out of two choices, the chances for future accounts do change based on previous ones.\u00a0 This is partially a limitation of the data but also the limitation of time limit for the Game Jam (A short marathon development session, we finished this entire game in less than a week).\u00a0 However, as the number of lives grow, it starts to represent the larger societal reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you make this political, games are supposed to be fun?</strong></p>\n<p>Because all art is political.\u00a0 When a system is racist, not saying something about it and opposing it supports that system.\u00a0 It is not enough to simply <em>not be racist</em>,one must be <em>anti-racist</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:30:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af34d2ba0e497a80733400269ae135cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Daydream"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
