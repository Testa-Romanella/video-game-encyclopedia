The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2b55 I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator. Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2734 Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots. If your device doesn't support the simulator, try using a newer device or look into updating its Operating System.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2734 If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don't hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T04:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53d/53d998185be6847a88237d11c36ceaa8.jpg", "website": "http://www.sailsim.app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko"], "esrb_rating": null}
