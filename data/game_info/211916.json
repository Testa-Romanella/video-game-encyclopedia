Jump above the plates without falling down. As your height increases, so does your score and the difficulty level. Collect all four keys of different colours as you go up. Avoid running into the clocks, as they will make the camera move quicker. Instructions are also provided in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/432f1784ad7d0cd588e694b89b9e6c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
