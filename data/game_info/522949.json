Every second you live contributes to your final score. Be careful, as the longer you stay alive, the faster blocks will fall. If you press the Space bar in the title screen, you can enter (or leave) practice mode, where blocks only fall as you move upwards, giving you as much time as needed to practice tricky jumps. Practice mode is not scored, however.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right: Move left or right</li><li>Up: Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T07:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90cc8ea5e83a78af969061ce64d085b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Noodlemire"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
