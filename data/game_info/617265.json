Its a game where your goal is to power all the houses. Playing it as is with no instruction can be a bit confusing, so here's some tips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To start, move to the power line post on the left, and click \"post\" in the store, then while hovering around the environment, choose a spot to place it, and then left-click to place. Posts cost 100 coins.\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0<br/>\n<p>You should see the house light up, and you will get coins for each house you power. from there, you can select a desired pole to add a post to. The more houses you power, the more coins you get, and once you've powered every house, you win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e82cf7f72a766fb53b9c057133b1bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IamReedHello"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
