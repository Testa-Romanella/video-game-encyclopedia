This game is my second game, I have begun to work on it after I didn't succeed in marketing my first game.</p>\n<p>I made it in two months knowing I won't have more time as I'm starting some really time-consuming studies. This game will be in fact my last game until 2019.</p>\n<p>It isn't some fancy, incredible and high-paced game. The gameplay isn't new. However, I put a lot of work in it to make something consistent. I learned a lot from my first game, and this was the occasion to put this knowledge at work. I think the result is good enough considering the time I had and the relative novelty of game development for me.</p>\n<p>Just try it, post a comment and share it if you liked it.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll have some kind of fun whether you play it 2 minutes or an hour, alone or with a friend.</p>\n<p>To make it clear, I probably won't post any update for this game. I know it could have been way better but I don't feel like spending more time on it. I've got a lot of other game ideas for when my studies will be over.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'll upload it to the Play Store.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bda1086f8db312efaaaf1cee1413df8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DotGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
