Since then, I focused more and more on marketing and producing entertainment, and less on creating it. I haven't been involved in any active development in years, so today I set myself a challenge: to create Pong in one day.</p><p>So I sat down with GameMaker: Studio and did just that. It was nice to go back to where I once started, back to creating content. I hope you guys enjoy, and maybe I'll do this again soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/7195509defdcdaf76082afa4ee84bb6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirAnon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
