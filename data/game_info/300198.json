But the rebellion has not ended yet...</p>\n<p>City of Thunder puts 2D pixelart into 3D space. It creates interesting paralax effects and empowers the feeling of space and depth. You are able to move very close to every element, then the 3D sound kicks in! You can hear the airship's engine and the crackling flames.<br/>The game is rounded down with particle systems for explosions, flames and smoke. Small squares are used to match the pixel look of the environment.</p>\n\n<p>University Project from 2017/18 - Game Art Class<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98a6519934e429e645da8f390fe0f021.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas B."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
