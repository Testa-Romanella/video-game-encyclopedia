Selflessly crawl the dungeon club and face scores of <br/>inebriated monstrosities ready to welcome your back after your holiday break. It's time to get to work!<br/><br/><h3>Hack and Slash in the Club</h3><br/><br/><br/>Rip through the crowd and bust up some bosses. Consume powers hidden in gemstones to improve and upgrade your bouncing skills. Stir them together in various ways and discover powerful new mixes to demolish the drunks of the dungeon.<h3>Twitch Integration</h3><br/>Customize each NecroBouncer run with Twitch integration. Vote for artifacts, additional mana and health potion spawns, or even appear in the game as one of its wasted enemies. Choose a side and keep the good vibes alive!<h3>What Doesn\u2019t Kill You Makes You Stronger</h3><br/><br/><br/>Return stronger, angrier, and more heavily armed after each defeat. Experiment with outfits (each with its own unique perks) devise clever strategies, upgrade powers and swirl them all together with hundreds of artifacts.
