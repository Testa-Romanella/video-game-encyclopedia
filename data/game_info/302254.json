My first finished game jam. I participated in 3 or 4 up until now and never finished a game. Is that what pride feels like ? I guess it does. Jokes aside, not a big game, but hopefully okay considering my experience.</p>\n<p>I unfortunately lost the first 24 hours by forgetting to read the limitation : 4 colors... I had made beautiful voxel models in order to make a game where, as a god, you'd have a limited set of tools and action per era, and then you'd have to wait for the world to evolve for a full era. The goal was to end up with a fully sandbox game or a survival game (don't let the planet perish, evolve basic species...). The world was grid based so as to have simple sets of rules to propagate the player's action.</p>\n<p>I almost ended up doing a gameboy-style shader for this project but I though \"meh, everyone does that, and they probably do it better than me\",\u00a0 so\u00a0I decided to use the limitation more creatively, and interpret the theme more freely (days limitation mechanic).</p>\n<p>As with all other jams, especially the last few I took seriously (mini jam 14 and 21) I learned a whole lot about game development and most importantly my engine of choice : Unity. My most important lesson this time around is when to stop making beautiful development. You can't start coding and developing ugly as it will slow you down in the end, but at some point you gotta say \"ok, I think this is a solid-enough basis, let's build off that and not make modular reusable code/assets from now on\".</p>\n<p>While the puzzle element is basic I feel like the core mechanics are good enough for an actual puzzle game. Adding more status (currently only shape, size, and black/white) and more limited transitions between those added states would make for a very fun puzzle game, especially if adding an achievment per level for beating a set number of actions.</p>\n<p>I personally don't intend on building upon this, but if you do like the concept, please feel free to, just credit me ;)</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Code/Graphics/Winning fanfare music : Me<br/>Sounds : Creative Commons sounds from\u00a0http://soundbible.com<br/>The music was created using\u00a0https://www.beepbox.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b9c0397ca3d3f95e025e9075984d39a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevilBlackDeath"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
