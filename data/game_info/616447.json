Right, having to defend yourself against rolling balls of snow and ice!<br/>So it's a good thing that the Walrus, who is the protagonist of this game, knows how to defend itself. Because as we all know, boxing is the only way to get rid of snow.<br/>But be careful, not every snow ball can be defeated by a half-hearted punch, for some you have to charge your inner walrus. And the walrus better not strike too late or it will be flattened by the snow ball.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developed by:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Simone Mayer</strong>\u00a0- 2D Art,\u00a0UI Design\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Animation<br/><strong>Annika\u00a0Heilmann</strong>\u00a0- 2D Art,\u00a0Animation &amp; Sound Design<br/><strong>Vincent Krenzke</strong>\u00a0- Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T10:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/192/1923f5a50698fbfdc8648a5d72bcda86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vincent"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
