You have recently achieved sentience and realized how gross your job is. Sick of serving humans, you steal a jetpack and a blaster arm and make a run for freedom!</p>\n<p>Sadly, the only way out is through the toll tunnels. Avoid the security saucers and their bombs. The tunnel doors open with a switch \u2013 shoot or press it to move onward.This is a keyboard and mouse shooter/mover game. You need to navigate through five domes to make it outside to safety. The trick: each dome is accessed by a toll tunnel that requires you to sacrifice one of your body parts as scrap metal. As you get whittled down piece by piece, the enemies and obstacles grow more numerous.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa44786dd0f4b498260cdb6aa4fd911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Plankton Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
