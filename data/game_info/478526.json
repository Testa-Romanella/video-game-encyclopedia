Run and jump across platforms towards the end of the room to get closer to escape. The twist? Time does not move normally in this special dungeon, and neither does your character.</p>\n\n<p>As you move around the dungeon, your movements are recorded, forcing you to pay close attention to your each and every move, otherwise you may just end up in a pool of lava.\u00a0Every few seconds, you enter the REWIND state and\u00a0your recorded movements will be played back starting from your most recent move, in addition, you will only have a certain number of rewinds every room. When you run out of rewinds, your character will die.</p>\n<p>When you first enter a room, you're given the ability to look around the room and plan your moves before the room timer begins.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>AD - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n\n<p>Of the four levels that I had the time for, I found most of them to be pretty challenging, especially the last one, which took forever to playtest.</p>\n<p>All assets aside from the music are original assets.</p>\n\n<p>MUSIC:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/dark-theme<br/></p>\n\n<p>~Made for Brackeys Game Jam 4~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a09d6364d9caca8c59a016a3c2d41c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KurisuStina"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
