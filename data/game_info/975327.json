Part tavern, part brothel, Labyrinthe is a venue for the seedy demon world to come together and revel in their own debauchery. <br/><br/>Owned and empowered by the nefarious imp, Luro, the dungeon itself is partly alive. Labyrinthe hears your thoughts and desires\u2026 Its walls shift and its rooms reform to suit your needs. Needless to say, the cocky, dick-dragging Drake has spent many a night plundering its depths.<br/><br/>But now, a strange, malevolent power has begun to seep through its stony walls. The black poison is infecting the dungeon's demonic patrons, wiping their minds and amplifying their savage natures, turning them away from debauchery to brutality.<br/><br/>Luro is all for a little chaos, but chaos he can control... Unable to contend with these violent mutations, he enlists Drake as his personal bodyguard to see him safely into the depths of the dungeon to find the source of the infectious evil.<br/><br/>Of course,  Luro has his own designs for his muscular companion... He may be trying to stop a murderous, demonic outbreak, but why not have a little fun along the way? He will ensure his handsome bodyguard gets worked to the fullest extent of his ability.<br/><br/><strong>Drake's Dungeon</strong> features guest appearances by Deimos (Class Comics) and Derek (Crown\u2019s Reverie) alongside new and familiar faces. Each hunk will find themselves getting entangled in Luro\u2019s schemes. Between the imp\u2019s lusty manipulations and the dungeon\u2019s potent danger, how will any of these brave hunks ever make it out on top?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T05:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb36c8251a38dc3f3d9efd752df0bc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 476, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hotchaWorks"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["hotchaWorks"], "esrb_rating": null}
