Race around a track, go through mountains, come out the other side and take on massive jumps as you speed through checkpoints.</p>\n<p>Gamewebsite:\u00a0https://sites.google.com/view/wreckracereloaded/home</p>\n<p>Trello Board:\u00a0https://trello.com/b/lHUgUHRn/wreckracereloadedvr2021</p>\n<p>Currently made to play on Rift or Quest, I'll be adding other platforms soon. Leave a comment with your platform and I'll priortise it.</p>\n<p>Cannons will shoot at you as you move around the track, the final score is a combination of checkpoint times (vs a target time per checkpoint) + damage dealt to Cannons - damage taken to the car.</p>\n\n<p>Possible scores +90 to -90 for checkpoint times over 9 checkpoints | +100 for damage to Cannons, each cannon has 4 damage tiers each with +5 points | -100 points for damage to car, 0 points until 30 damage, then 30 points at damage tier 1, +30 at damage tier 2 (60 points damage), +30 tier 3 and +10 tier 4 (full damage at 100 points damage).</p>\n\n<p>All feedback will help me to improve this game as I move to include new tracks and things like a steering wheel you can turn in VR. At the moment steering is either via grab and placing your hand on the steering wheel, or via the analogue stick on the controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feedback form here:</p>\n<p>I have recently upgraded to the new Action Based Unity Input System, this will let me hook up other VR Hardware types and also a steering wheel (I\u00a0have a Logitech G25 to test with).</p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>14 of the 16 music tracks are from the Free Music Archive: https://freemusicarchive.org/, the remaining two are thanks to BenSound: www.bensound.com</p>\n<p>1: Seth Power - Who | 2: Sebon Track#77 | 3: Marc Burt Caledinoa (Edit) | 4: Ketsa Worked-Out | 5: Josh Woodward Private Hurricane | 6:Josh Woodward I want To Destroy Something Beautiful | \u00a07: Jono bacon Free Software Song2 | 8: Jason Shaw WHEELS | 9: Jason Shaw MOUNTAIN SUN | 10: Jhazzar The Last Ones | 11: Jhazzar Siesta | 12: Black Agnes Tooms | 13: Audiobinger I\u00a0Used To Love Hiphop | 14: Audiobinger Desperados | 15: Bensound Hipjazz | 16 Bensound allthat\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c4780cb2307dd19136410a5e1a6d5d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kr4yZ33"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
