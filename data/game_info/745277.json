After hiding in a secret bunker for 33 years, you've finally come out to see what's left of the planet.  The apocalypse had been caused by humans.  It started when robots became smart enough to realize how destructive the human race was to its own environment.  When robots tried to reason with humans, they declared war instead of listening to them.  Quickly realizing that the war could not be won, because of the robots' intelligence, the humans decided to blow up the Earth.  If they couldn't win, they would at least bring everyone with them... Classic human behavior.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>5TR3-4M1 in the game</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After 33 years of waiting, you are finally going to discover the \"New World\".\u00a0\u00a0You descend a high cliff, only to find your energy beginning to drop at an alarming rate, and the\u00a0<strong><em>Stream</em></strong>\u00a0of debris and\u00a0rocks has never actually stopped.\u00a0As that was not enough, a massive volcanic eruption began to fill the valley you are in.  You'll need to get back to the bunker quickly before your energy runs out! So keep an eye on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, also, the lava would kill you instantly.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>* All assets and code are created by the team from scratch.</em></p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Maya Abdel Ahad (https://mayaabdelahad.itch.io/) - Game Designer/Art</p>\n<p>Marc-Olivier Lamothe (https://slampeetam.itch.io/) - Game Designer/Art</p>\n<p>Vincent Roy (https://lordoffiles.itch.io/) - Programmer</p>\n<p>Charlie Beaulieu (https://excel1vmn.itch.io/) - Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T12:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb01d79d9a42d7a1737a365c5d4e8f64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mayaabdelahad"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
