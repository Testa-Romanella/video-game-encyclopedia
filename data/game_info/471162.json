When the map appears,\u00a0tap anywhere to move. When the \"fight\" button appears, click it to open a fight. When enemies are attacking, drag your shield anywhere on the screen to not take damage. To attack, slide your finger across the screen in order to mimic a sword's motion. Make sure to always target your card with the camera. Levelling up will open up new fights.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Claudio Visentin: Programming, design,\u00a0</li><li>Shaun Gillen: Art, design</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Original Release Date:\u00a0</strong>December 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T02:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba9857cdf564f8fd11743c25e3ac440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Claudio Visentin"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
