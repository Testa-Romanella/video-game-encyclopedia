I plan to use the given art to create new themes as well. I am excited about the possibilities using the given hallways, and other terrain as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Making the player death effect more interesting: I saw this one in the modification list and it really interests me!\u00a0I enjoyed working with particles for the double jump effect and would like another opportunity to potentially work with particles among other techniques.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 New game music: I've been wanting to make new game music for one of the projects and now seems like the time to do it! I have access to GarageBand, and other\u00a0 music making software, so I will use that to create a new, unique soundtrack for our little astronaut to jam to.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Created By: Erin Sawyer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T15:33:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0e4a76371c5ef1a1fa1ba77d9995f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Erinsa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
