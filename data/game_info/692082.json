We are in! The goal is to try and tame coronaviruses (Covid 19). They have mutated into macro viruses during an experiment on an island within a specified time.<br/><br/>As always, a rogue state experimented with the coronaviruses; unfortunately, the experiment got out of control. The viruses have mutated into macro viruses and have changed their shape. You have 90 seconds to improve the situation. You have a turbo space glider at your disposal, equipped with a laser-plasma cannon.<br/><br/>The island atoll is three by 3 kilometers in size, and you have the space glider with an unlimited shot laser-plasma cannon. The newly developed plasma laser vortex has a penetration range of 1,000 meters. Most viruses have mutated, some still have the typical corona shape, some have reached an intermediate stage, and are highly explosive. If these are hit, they are all shredded in a 400-meter range. You can recognize them by their size, as they are something smaller and with a reddish color!<br/><br/>Coronavirus 15 points per shot. Two hits are required. A double shot earns you additional points 5, triples 10, ultra 20. So with one shot, you shoot 2, 3, 4, or more on a line, but it doesn't have to be a shot!<br/><br/>The explosive virus can be shredded within a 400-meter radius, and there are many points; the disadvantage is that you can do fewer doubles, triples, etc...<br/><br/>If the explosive viruses lie next to each other at perfect intervals, a chain reaction can sometimes develop, and you can score many points.<br/><br/>The key functions in the CoronaKO:<br/><br/></p>\n\n<li>Quick start and recognition of the hardware</li><li>Modifiable graphic details</li><li>Wind, water, refraction, reflection</li><li>Different Corona fours</li><li>Laser-Plasma cannon</li><li>Turbo space glider</li><li>and much more<br/>\n<p>Other features and specifications:</p>\n</li><li>Low CPU and RAM utilization</li><li>Very small, under 2 MB</li><li>WASD control or arrow keys</li><li>Look = mouse / shot = left mouse button</li>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T09:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74e/74ea4c61974cb8abd64d63ee21cd7fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nenad Hrg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
