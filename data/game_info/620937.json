This was axed in favour of implementing the Pulse Attack, which was something we wanted from the beginning but only figured out a possible solution in the final hours (before this just a simple touch of the wire would kill the enemies).</p>\n<p>A More Dynamic Wire - The initial idea was to have the wire grow and shrink depending on how far the players were from each other, but that feature was sinking into too much of our time, so it was axed in favour of just giving them a good length of wire to begin with and leave it at that length.</p>\n<p>Power Indicator - There was a Lightning Symbol that would appear under the Battery when it was Sig or Null's turn to pass on the Pulse Attack. This was how we found out about the bug described in the next section, but in our attempt of fixing said bug, we completely lost all files to do with this power indicator. It looked really nice too :(</p>\n\r\nBugs That We're Aware Of\r\n<p>At a certain point it becomes possible for either Sig or Null to trigger the Pulse Attack, regardless if it's their turn or not. We were scrambling for a solution in the final hour, but could not solve it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f598ea76844d41d25f72e37d4c68509.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Greenlord Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
