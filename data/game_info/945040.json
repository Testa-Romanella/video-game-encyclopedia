You can wishlist it here\n<br/><br/>\n\nYou're on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a dozen times over. You can't let that happen. Don't forget, the fate of the world rests on your shoulders.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're not going to listen to him, are you? We're supposed to save princesses, not slay them...\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeatures\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li> A princess. She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.\n<br/>\n</li><li> No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror. She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.\n<br/>\n</li><li> Don't even think about trying to romance her. It won't end well for you.\n<br/>\n</li><li> Hopefully you won't die. But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!\n<br/>\n</li><li> Time loops No time loops. Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't \"loop,\" whatever that's supposed to mean.\n<br/>\n</li><li> A branching narrative where what you say and what you believe determines both your build and how the story unfolds.\n<br/>\n</li><li> A new roleplaying experience from the creators of Scarlet Hollow.\n<br/>\n</li><li> Fully voice-acted by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSlay the Princess is a choice-driven psychological horror visual novel/dating sim with dramatic branching, light RPG elements, and hand-penciled art.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T05:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1ae55dab9b848f23568684ec505c4d78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Black Tabby Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Black Tabby Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
