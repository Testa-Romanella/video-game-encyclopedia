Sending visitors to jail, inadvertently zapping them to smithereens, or letting them go on their merry way are all part of the job. But be careful: who you let through the castle gates will determine the kingdom's fate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>See the Sprawl and its fantastical &amp; quirky citizens through a royal wedding to one of two kingdoms vying for an alliance, and a subsequent siege by whoever you've angered in the process. Your decisions can determine the fate of the city and its people!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Interrogate 100+ fully voiced characters in just the right way to earn a perfect score.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Spend your hard earned gold wisely on powering up your guardsman toolkit, and strategically deploy these to admit or deny the right people or...goblins?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Use your trusty Chronometer3000 to go back and get a higher score... but be careful not to break space and time in the process.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-04T22:49:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2269675a8e09060677c6583ae5012a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 479, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hilltop Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["tinyBuild", "Versus Evil"], "esrb_rating": null}
