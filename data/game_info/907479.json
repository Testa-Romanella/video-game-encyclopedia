They also do simulated conservation quests to help the animals. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe locations featured are Hawaii and the Mesoamerican Reef. In this 2D side-scroller, players walk, snorkel, and SCUBA dive to find crabs, whales, fish, dolphins and other animals.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nQuests include planting mangrove seedlings, stopping illegal fishing, slowing down speeding boats, cleaning polluted water, farming seaweed and listening for whales with a hydrophone.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers collect points for finding species. They can also take photos to store in the simulated photo album. Points are used to purchase quest-related tools in the simulated stores at each location. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers also collect information cards. The more times they find the same species, the more information is added to these cards - text, photos and videos about these species.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T05:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509a9b8fb7f72673197989d9077d8e7e.jpg", "website": "https://findthewhales.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thought Generation Society"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Thought Generation Society"], "esrb_rating": null}
