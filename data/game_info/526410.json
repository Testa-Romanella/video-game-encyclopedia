Will you manage to deal with the two levels of this 10 to 20 minutes long game? (could be a bit \u2014 or even, much \u2014 longer in case of Gameover).</p>\n<p>The game was made by C\u00e9cile Dumont (graphics, sounds) and Lo\u00efg Jezequel (programming, sounds, music). It is based on the Ebiten library.</p>\n<p>The provided video is a complete playthrough, just in case anyone needs it to have a glimpse of the full game.</p>\n<p>The Mac version is provided thanks to\u00a0Sinisterstuf, who gladly compiled it from the github sources.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Amel Bent for musical inspiration.</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> We strongly advise to download the game rather than playing the online version, as the later has no sounds and no music. We decided to provide this online version however, as we do understand that downloading a game is not always convenient.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7116d9e81cec0b633a91fd61686b0d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["loig", "Ccile"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
