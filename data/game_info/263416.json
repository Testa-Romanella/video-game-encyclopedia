Featuring an endless mode to test how far your skills will take you, and a versus mode to show your friends who's boss!</p>\n<p>- Notes from the developer -<br/></p>\n<p>This is the product of devtober 2018! I made this over the course of a month, starting October 1st and ending on Halloween.</p>\n<p>Originally, I had the idea to make a game with multiple levels, boss fights, etc, but I quickly realized that was too big of a scope. As such, I shrunk down my goals for devtober to function as a vertical slice of a full game that I plan to finish in the future. This demo contains an endless mode and a versus mode to show off the core mechanics and local multiplayer.</p>\n<p>No plans on when the full game will be released yet.
