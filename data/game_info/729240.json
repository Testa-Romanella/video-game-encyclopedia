It gives you the chance to take care of your own virtual, doodly fish pets, to see them grow and interact on real timescale!</p>\n\n<p>This prototype version contains up to 9 different kind of fishes, most of them based on their real version, but hand drawn in your new notebook aquarium! All the fishes mimic the lifecycle of non-drawing fishes by growing up, mating and interacting with other doodly fishes!</p>\n<p>This time, you start with 4 different pen colors for your fishes, which will allow you to breed in a hunt for the colors you'd like the most for every one of your inky friends!</p>\n<em>Psssst... I heard that sometimes a doodly mom\u00a0get give birth albino fishes. It'd be really cool to add white to your color aquarium color palette, right?</em>\n<p>Paperaquarium also makes a perfect companion to help you relax or even concentrate while working or studying so you can stay <em>in the zone</em>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ingame time based on real time: Fish tank fishes are animals that grow fast, but you'll need some patience since these doodly pets will take almost as much time as their real counterpart to grow! Also watch out for the day/night version of your aquarium!</li><li>Fish will continue to live, grow and evolve even if you're not present (Or your game is closed). Thats really cool, but don't forget to check on them from time to time, we don't want them to starve, right?</li><li>Color breeding: Starting with your little color pen palette, breed your fishes in search for your favorite colors!\u00a0Who said goldfishes can't be pink!?</li><li>Hand drawn notebook-asthetic, just like when you used to doodle some fishes on your math notebook and wished they could move (But now they can!)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>- How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Playing Paperquarium is pretty simple. Once you open the game you'll arrive on your notebook aquarium, where you'll fishes will live.\u00a0 You can drop some food for them by clicking anywhere in the aquarium.</li><li>By clicking on a fish, you'll show their info post-it, where you can check some more info about them and their status.
