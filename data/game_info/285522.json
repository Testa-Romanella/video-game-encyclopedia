It works, I promise.<br/></p>\n<p>First built in 2006 as part of a dev competition (we weren't calling them \"jams\" back then), Overseer Assault is the first complete game I ever made. Built in Game Maker 6, it lacks sound, proper graphics, and has some glaring faults, but is otherwise a fairly complete experience and a reasonably fun time around one computer. It has a tutorial, level editor, and animated sprites. Fun for all the family.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c61314f3c622a159cf508ddbb2d60b81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gazza_N"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
