While you do not have a proper jumpdrive (meaning you cannot escape), you can still \"flip\" into hyperspace and back.</p>\n<p>Note that while there are some asteroids, they serve more as a backdrop than as an obstacle or a goal. You cannot break them by shooting, but they cannot break you either if you slam into one.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made in 3 hours, with the exception of the main menu (which just lists the controls and a snip of the \"story\"). Font and certain UI elements are not my work, instead, they are part of the default Godot engine theme.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c48/c4898c47dc2b35790e0efa6595c5f702.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bojidar_bg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
