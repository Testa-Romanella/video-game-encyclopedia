I have played through all kinds such as Desktop Tower Defense, Element TD (Warcraft 3 mod) and, of course, Kingdom Rush.</p>\n<p>My initial idea with this game was to crash course myself into game development with Unity and since I really wanted to make a TD game I ended up buying some visual assets to make this project come true.</p>\n<p>This game (Version 1.6 at the time)\u00a0was developed under a month and I'm pretty happy with the result, and because of that I decided to share it. I've been able to test it a few times (with some help from some friends)\u00a0and fix a few major problems, but if you find any other issues don't hesitate to contact me! Feel free to leave some feedback too, I'd greatly appreciate!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0iwanPlays,\u00a0Nakhas,\u00a0Cyberios,\u00a0Lydmakeren,\u00a0qubodup,\u00a0Hanbaal, Erdie, DominikBraun, spring, otto-halm\u00e9n\u00a0and\u00a0Michel\u00a0Baradari\u00a0for their free sound assets.</p>\n<p>Art by Craftpix</p>\n<p>Developer: Victor R\u00e9gis</p>\n<p>TO DO list:</p>\n<p>- Implement better UI (I already have the UI elements, just need to figure out a nice way to display them)</p>\n<p>- Create more levels (takes some time, but I believe I'm going to release at least two more maps)</p>\n<p>- Add more enemy variety (I wanted to implement special enemies, but they demand a lot of work for little improvement in the game overall)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a70/a703b4cc8795e23e11a7b6fd832b2665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["victor.regis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
