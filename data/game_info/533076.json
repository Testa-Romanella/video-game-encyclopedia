He was raised with the expectations of excelling in magic and entering government, and he works hard to meet those expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Luna</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Luna is an ambitious person who dreams of running her own clothing business one day.\u00a0She's more accustomed to solo work than team projects, but she looks out for others all the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Charlotte is a spirited girl looking to bring change in the world through the study of magic. She's not the best at speaking, so she's the type to practice talking with her plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Will</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Will is trying to find his way in the world, but he's easily scared and hesitant to try new things. He's also not the biggest fan of bugs, and that's definitely an understatement.</p>\n<p><strong>Annie</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Annie had a lot of responsibility growing up, so she's a reliable older sister figure that many can count on. She\u00a0has a sunny personality and loves to lend a helping hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Nestor</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Nestor needs at least ten coffees a day to function. He's a little snarky and blunt and enjoys giving people a hard time, but is kind underneath that harsh exterior.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Brief swearing</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>\n<p>None of us specialize in programming, so there most likely will be bugs. Here's a list of known issues that we'll try to fix with later updates (keyword <em>try</em> because we can't program):</p>\n<ul><li>Portraits will not show when you load a save file made in the middle of a conversation with someone. Portraits will definitely show eventually, you just might end up carrying a conversation with someone who's not there for a while.</li><li>Objects will become interactable during the \"Yes\"/\"No\" menu choice. Clicking on other objects during this time probably won't break the game, but it'll just be a bit funky.</li></ul>\n<p>Hopefully these bugs don't detract too much from the experience and story!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20b018eeb1a69f38fb3f207f67a6c4c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Team Meringue"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
