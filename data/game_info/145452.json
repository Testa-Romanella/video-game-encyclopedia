It's not finished, and it's almost certainly not fun.</em></p><p>Everyone knows worlds which sit on top of turtles or elephants or trees. <br/><br/>You might have heard that some worlds don't ride on top of anything, they just roll around like a ball. <br/><br/>Now you can see for yourself how those ball-shaped worlds get made. <br/><br/>IN A NEW PART OF THE UNIVERSE, WHERE TIME AND SPACE HAVEN'T SETTLED DOWN YET... <br/><br/><br/>A \"God game\" which plays like an RTS up close, but builds up to something more like Tetris (with very, very large pieces). <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>HOW IT WENT DOWN </strong><br/><br/>The game is definitely not finished. The game ends before the player can connect worlds together to make a big Tetris-style monstrosity. <br/><br/>The initial entry version left in the development-mode \"press zoom to win\" button. This version removes the \"win\" shortcut.<br/><br/><strong>COMPATIBILITY </strong><br/><br/>Playing the original entry with Firefox crashed (decoding audio), but I've uploaded a new version that doesn't crash (just misses some audio instead).</p><p> Chrome should work. Safari too.</p><p>No idea about Internet Explorer or mobile devices.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01e7c124601b16a82d1ede7c8226352e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rjhunter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
