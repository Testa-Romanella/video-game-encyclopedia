Browser version coming soon!!!</p>\n<p>Sanie Dead is a game about the horrors of anxiety and overworking yourself, is almost poetic that our coder overworked himself a lot making this game.</p>\n<p>The game is a mix of visual novel and microgames and the entire experience is about 10 minutes long, the game focuses on its subject and art instead of so much on a complex gameplay.</p>\n<p>Made for Halloween but blew a little bit the deadline haha(by 5 hours to be exact).<br/></p>\n<p>The game will also have an art collection in Neonmob in a couple months in case you are a user of the platform and is interested.</p>\n<p>This is version 0.9, its an almost complete version of the game, we have a update planned to improve the audio and add some animations that we had to cut for this version, the new version and browser playable version will be coming on the next couple weeks.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, feel free to use the comment boards here to tell us, we will be reading every message we get!</p>\n<p>If you like our game and our storytelling, why not take a look at our first commercial endeavor?\u00a0 When the Winter Comes, a demo is available right here on itch.io, you can also support us with donations or in\u00a0patreon if you want to, you can get some high res game art,\u00a0your name on the credits of future games and the satisfaction of knowing you helped a very small studio keep its doors open, thanks a lot for your support!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T12:05:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/925841f51fa38d3f7a731500b3681f58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["White Lotus Digital"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
