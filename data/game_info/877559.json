After I made this game I managed to track down the original, its here...\u00a0https://joachim.itch.io/numbertron</p>\n<p>My game is probably quite different, but inspired by Numbertron.</p>\n<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of Kardinal Kid\u00a0is to move a little dog around around a 'maze' of numbers. If you play with hearts or diamonds switched on then you need to jump these objects to progress. Each level has a number of objects you must jump in order to get to the next level. After you have jumped to required amount you can allow yourself to die to move to the next level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hearts mode alone will be more of a challenge. You can make the game easier by playing with diamonds on. Or there is a casual mode with both hearts and diamonds turned off. Toggle the options and explore to so which game mode suites you!</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to escape the number maze. There are 2 screens of spectrum art that can be seen as you progress and get ultimately\u00a0escape.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game now includes music at the start too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26fba5d51ca55e723f46f7e7a84736b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J Bizzel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
