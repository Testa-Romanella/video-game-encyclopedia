Fight against other players in this free for all deathmatch.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGameplay Framework\r\n<p><strong>Overarching Goal - First Player to Get 10 Kills Wins!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Concept -\u00a0</strong>During the course of a game each player can go through three phases: Sniper, Assault, and Tactical. During each phase, players must use a certain weapon and get a certain number of kills with it in order to move onto the next phase and finish first.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGameplay Flow\r\n<p><strong>1st Phase </strong>- Sniper - Get Five Kills with a Sniper Rifle</p>\n<p>(Weapon Switches)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Phase</strong> - Assault - Get 3 Kills with a Assault Rifle</p>\n<p>(Weapon Switches)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Phase</strong> - Tactical - Get 2 Kills with a Pistol</p>\n<p>(Player with 10 kills wins!)</p>\n\r\nGameplay Intent\r\n<p>The idea behind switching the players weapons based on number of kills was to utilize the space in different ways. Snipers can find a good spot and locate enemies, however, while wielding a pistol you have to be more upfront and personal. As a player you have to constantly switch up your tactics if you want to come over top. It also becomes progressively harder to get your last kills, giving a chance for players who have fallen behind\u00a0to try to climb the leaderboard.\u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Shift - Sprint\u00a0</li><li>C - Crouch</li><li>R - Reload</li><li>Right Mouse Button - Aim (Only Sniper)\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Attributions to the Core Community Creators\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shift To Sprint By: FmTrick</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T02:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/58300707aedc71e80be3902b951e486c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sukhraj Johal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
