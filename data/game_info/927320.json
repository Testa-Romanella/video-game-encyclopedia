(It also has a time trial single player mode).</p>\n<p>*******</p>\r\nIMPORTANT\r\n<p>Keyboard and mouse are required to play as player 1. Other players may be added with controllers and other keyboards.</p>\n<p>*******</p>\n<p>This game was the first that I created in my journey to learning game development. It was developed to learn new skills in the Unity game engine. <br/></p>\r\nLEARNED SKILLS, briefly:\r\n<ul><li> Car mechanics with Unity's integrated wheel collider system to make vehicles.</li><li>Car destroying and life mechanics.</li><li>Camera system for multiplayer gamemode.</li><li>Objects interactions using Unity's integrated physics system.</li><li>Basic Blender modelling skills.\r\n </li><li>Shader creation with shader graph\r\n </li><li>Music and SFX creation.</li><li>Animation, sound effects, particle systems and screen shake to provide feedback to the player.</li><li>Keyboard and controller integration with Unity's input system. Local multiplayer with many controllers.</li><li>UI design with animations and SFX to provide feedback to the player.</li></ul>\r\nLEARNED SKILLS in more detail:<p>\n</p><ul><li><strong>Car mechanics</strong>:\u00a0an arcade style car controller has been programmed. By using Unity's integrated wheel colliders, and by applying torque forces, the car works as an arcade-y car.</li></ul>\n<p>The values of the motor/ break forces, mass of the car and steering angles, the controller can be modified.</p><p>\n</p><ul><li><strong>Car destroying and life mechanics</strong>: cars are destructible to encourage player interaction by hitting other cars. Environments also takes place in the interaction, as it can affect car life.</li></ul>\n<p>Also, a fast restart system has been created so each player can restart level. This has been implemented to encourage fast-paced gameplay so players don't play too conservative.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the level design is not too good, cars can get stuck in different places, so a fast restart system is crucial.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Camera system for multiplayer gamemode</strong>: a multiplayer camera has been implemented (similar to smash bros camera) that encapsulates all the players in the scene at all times, and works in 3D.</li></ul>\n<p>Also, camera animations have been implemented and changes between cameras.<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Objects interactions</strong>: by using Unity's integrated physics system,\u00a0the\u00a0objects on\u00a0the\u00a0scenarios\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0give\u00a0feedback\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0player.\u00a0 Trees play hit animations and sounds, and apples fall when they are hit by cars.<ul><li> Bushes play hit animations and sounds, and leaf particles are thrown.</li><li>Cars can damage other cars and break them when they hit them.</li><li>Trains can throw cars in the air and destroy cars immediately.</li><li>Tables and benches break and play sounds when hit.</li><li>People are thrown into the air\u00a0and play sounds when hit.</li><li>Mechanical bridges open and close by using animations and open/close cycles can be easily controlled on the editor.<br/>\n</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Basic Blender modelling skills</strong>:\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0models\u00a0in the game\u00a0have been created in Blender. Also, by using post-processing stack, the visuals of the game have been updated to fit the tone.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Shader creation with shader graph</strong>: a toon water shader has been created with basic shader graph nodes as color, time, vertex position, voronoi...</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Music and SFX creation</strong>:\u00a0the\u00a0music has been\u00a0created\u00a0in\u00a0Reaper\u00a0by\u00a0using virtual\u00a0instruments.\u00a0SFX\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0created with online\u00a0tools\u00a0and by mixing free SFX.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Animation, sound effects, particle systems and screen shake</strong>: to provide feedback to the player, there are more of these elements are placed in many places of the game.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Keyboard and controller integration with Unity's input system. Local multiplayer with many controllers</strong>: the\u00a0game\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0single-player\u00a0or\u00a0multiplayer\u00a0modes,\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0done\u00a0with Unity's\u00a0input\u00a0system.\r\n    </li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>UI design with animations and SFX to provide feedback to the player</strong>: the main menu has been designed with basic animations and sounds to provide some kind of feedback to the player while navigating through them.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T13:12:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47047eb559429e3b7afefb9bbdca141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["enekoatxa"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
