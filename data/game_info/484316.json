The top number is the total points in that row/column. The bottom number is the bomb count in that row/column.</li></ul><ul><li>Proceed by elimination to find the cards most likely to give you high numbers.</li></ul><ul><li>Tap a selected card again to flip it, or use the FLIP button.</li></ul><ul><li>The first card you flip will be your starting score, and the next cards will multiply your score by <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong>. A <strong>bomb</strong> will drop your score to zero and end the game.</li></ul><ul><li>To win a game, flip over all the <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> cards.</li></ul><ul><li>When you win, the level increases by 1. It decreases by 1 when you lose.</li></ul><ul><li>The level determines the amount of points, but also the number of bombs. Higher levels offer higher rewards, but a higher risk as well.</li></ul><ul><li>The four numbered buttons allow you to make notes on each card to help determine their value. The larger pencil button toggles all the notes on a card. Use notes to your advantage!</li></ul>\n<p>I do NOT claim to own this game's base concept. Thanks a bunch to Gamefreak/Pok\u00e9mon for coming up with such an amazing and addicting puzzle game concept.</p>\n<p>Also thanks to all the people who already made clones of Voltorb Flip, who inspired me to make my own. Most notably: thanks to ianjsikes for making FLIP OUT (Voltorb Flip clone for PICO-8) here on itch!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a52fe0f7c407dbe7bf1eabf7cece0da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Herald"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
