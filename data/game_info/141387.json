The twist is that the game has real-time weather reflection and lighting which effects on game-play. Watch your way through narrow corridors and try to pick all special items. I get stars based on how good your time was. The game requires an internet connection for full functionality (weather effects, analytics and multiplayer).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f9ba16c83e78a7635198f1a09f7c60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrickha"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
