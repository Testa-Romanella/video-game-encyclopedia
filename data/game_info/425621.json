Each neighbor has a different personality, and would love to meet you! Check the forest, the beach, just about anywhere.

I used this game as my excuse to learn both!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>This game is a prototype and contains some weird texture clipping in parts of the water. That is because of the world-curving shader and I couldn't quite get everything to play nicely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb1cb828cf70b9cd4360a2bf6b589afd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pencil Row Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
