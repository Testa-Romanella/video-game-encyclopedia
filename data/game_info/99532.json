Even if you succeed, you can return at any time to challenge your previous best time!</p>\n<p>Sneak is a 2D stealth platformer where you need to either carefully time your approach to the guards' and searchlights' patterns, or - if you're <em>really</em> good at it - use your reflexes to rush through everything lightning-quick before you even get noticed. Searchlights and guards both have graze periods representing the guards' reaction speed; move fast enough and you won't get caught. Staying a short while at the far end of a flashlight will even cause the guard to delay a bit to see if there is someone hiding in the shadows, letting you manipulate patrol paths ever so slightly!</p>\n<p>My first game jam game ever, made in 72 hours. The theme was 'time'. No epic boss battle, but at least there's two playable characters!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/2806b5dd107a77e4a09b3cfa5da33e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
