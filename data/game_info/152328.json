Coming into this we knew little about Game Design, yet we think that actually we\u2019ve come out with something not half bad. It\u2019s perhaps not at a competition winning standard, but we\u2019re still very pleased that we actually managed to produce something in the time allotted.<br/></p>\n<p>Essentially, our game is a 2D space shooter in which you pilot a spaceship and kill enemies, with the twist that anything you do slowly drains you of energy. We implemented waves of enemies that would follow you and fire various weapons at you before you face a final boss (yes it\u2019s a little clich\u00e9, but we couldn\u2019t resist).</p>\n<p><strong>There are 3 control modes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation and WASD control movement relative to that.</li><li>Keyboard Controls - Where the A and D controls rotation and WSQE control movement relative to that.</li><li>Absolute Controls - Where the mouse controls rotation, but the ship moves according to the WASD keys absolutely (so W is always up).</li></ul>\n<p>The balance of the game is not entirely perfect, and it is lacking polish in some areas (such as the obvious omittance of an animation when a laser beam hit\u2019s something), but overall we\u2019re very pleased to say that it is our first game.</p>\n<p>We hope you have fun playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e3495f195f7aac8a43e0c9532060a2d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RKDelta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
