{"id": 55333, "slug": "ancient-domains-of-mystery", "name": "Ancient Domains of Mystery", "name_original": "Ancient Domains of Mystery", "description": "<p>Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM) is a roguelike video game, designed and developed by Thomas Biskup, which was first released in 1994. The player&#39;s goal is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia.<br />\nLike the original roguelike games, Ancient Domains of Mystery uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. A later version added the option to play with sound, tile-based graphics, and an overworld map. Most dungeons are procedurally generated, but once the game generates a dungeon, it does not change even if the player exits and re-enters it. (The Infinite Dungeon is an exception, however.)<br />\nBiskup ceased development of the game for nine years, but revisited it in 2012. He also resumed work on a sequel, Ancient Domains of Mystery II. Biskup first made an updated version of ADOM available to sponsors of his crowdfunding campaign. Later versions, beginning with v1.15.2.r60, he released on the Web and through digital distribution services.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:42:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3edc8be687416bc93d8833050f1b6e32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Zeno Rogue", "Lucas Dieguez", "Krzysztof Dycha", "Thomas Biskup", "Jochen Terstiege"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Thomas Biskup"], "esrb_rating": null}
