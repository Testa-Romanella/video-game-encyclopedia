{"id": 82177, "slug": "fibbles", "name": "Fibbles", "name_original": "Fibbles", "description": "Fibbles is a fun, endless, extremely addictive 3D game where you tap two bubbles (Fibbles) in the Fibonacci sequence.  Your oxygen supply will be quickly decreasing as more and more Fibbles fill up the 3D room.  By popping two Fibbles, you gain a little oxygen to help keep you alive.  Because it is 3D, moving around the room may give you a better view of the floating Fibbles and help you to find the oxygen tanks.<br/><br/>You will quickly learn the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,etc.) to be able to pop Fibbles at rapid speeds.  Each scene consists of 17 levels.  Each level will add more and more combinations of numbered Fibbles to choose from. As you progress to the next scene, the Fibbles will float and spin around with increasing speed.  This challenging game will have you addicted from the first two taps!  How many levels and scenes can you complete?<br/><br/>Tips:<br/>1. Lightly tap the Fibbles (to avoid moving around the room).<br/>2. Try to tap an oxygen tank before moving to the next level.<br/>3. Swipe left or right to move around the room to get a better view of Fibbles and oxygen tanks.<br/>4. Watch the Fibonacci sequence at the bottom of the screen to find Fibbles next to one another.<br/>5. Use both hands to move around and tap Fibbles.<br/><br/>Please send feedback or requests to fibbles@spiralinnovations.com.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T08:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37c1ff84c9a7a64528fde5c91dcbafe9.jpg", "website": "http://facebook.com/fibblesapp", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Olea"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["David Olea"], "esrb_rating": null}
