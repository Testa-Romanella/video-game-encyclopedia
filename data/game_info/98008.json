A first-person object collection and puzzle-solving horror game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Original description from my 2012 deviantART upload:</em></p>\n<p>This is my first full game and I made it almost completely by myself! It's also the first time I've worked on a 3D game, using the Unreal Development Kit.<br/>Some of the textures and models were taken from the UDK, and the sounds are all from freesound.org, though I remixed some of them.</p>\n<p>Regarding the game itself: This is a single player first person horror game inspired by the likes of Slender and the SCP series of games. It's set in a nightmare landscape and tells a short story.<br/>You will probably need some patience to be able to play this as part of the game is being lost in unfamiliar surroundings and finding out puzzle solutions. <br/><strong>Please have sound turned on while playing, it is actually necessary to complete the game!</strong></p>\n<p>I've learned a lot during the making of this game and worked hard to make it the best it can be with the possibilities I had.<br/></p>\n<p>The game has been tested quite thoroughly, but I can't guarantee it's completely free of bugs of course. <br/>Being a solo project, it's not very optimised and will sadly not run well on older systems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f2624fccb1cb251efd8b9b3967cded4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cubehero"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
