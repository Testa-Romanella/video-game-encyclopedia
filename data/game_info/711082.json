Humans better watch out! Rawr!<h3>Story</h3><br/>It\u2019s been a few weeks since Judgement Day \u2014 when dragons covered the world\u2019s skies. Humankind has been trying to adapt to a new daily life. But far beyond the skies above, the situation in the sea of stars has grown intense.<br/><br/>The dragons were split in half in their opinion on how to deal with humankind and in the confusion, Iris, dragon queen of the Sea and Water factions, descends to Earth, claiming the seas and barring all humans from entering them. With summer resorts and fishing shut down and even people in some countries unable to travel outside their borders, things looked bleak.<br/><br/>Days later, the dragon girl Dorami convinces Takeru, Haru and Suzuya to go to the beach for a vacation. What awaits Haru and the others as they approach the territory of the sea dragons? But for now, they\u2019ll just have a barbecue. Maybe even split a watermelon.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Art by Takano Yuki (NEKO-NIN series, Da Capo)<br/></li><li>English and traditional Chinese language options<br/></li><li>Japanese voice acting<br/></li><li>Extras gallery for CGs/OP Movie/Favorited voice lines<br/></li><li>Engaging story continuing on from the last volume<br/></li><li>Hours of content to read<br/></li><li>Kinetic story<br/></li><li>More NEET dragon girls</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T03:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/488f61bff7d0746c6d153f9be8c38ac3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whirlpool"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
