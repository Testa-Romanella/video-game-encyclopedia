Wooly Bloom was created in a 48-hour\u00a0GameJam where it took first place, but because we had so much fun we added a day of polishing on top! We\u00a0recommend playing this game with a controller/game pad but you can also use Keyboard &amp; mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Big Special Thanks to Artist\u00a0Karina Klintz (https://karina_klnz.artstation.com/) and Programmer Marten Kahl (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marten-kahl-090969172/) for contributing to this project and working with us, it was a pleasure! <br/><br/>The game is not just cozy and peaceful - but completely kid-friendly!
