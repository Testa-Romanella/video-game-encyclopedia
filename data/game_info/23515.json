Yep, \"epicist\" most definitely is a real word. Absolutely it is.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCommand your troops, don't take any grief back, try to do more damage to your enemies than to yourself. That's all we ask trooper, all we ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFEATURES:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSingle player campaign mode that introduces new concepts as you play - no boring tutorial campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSkirmish mode with up to six players - any combo of local friends or AI's on a wide range of maps for infinite replay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRandom map generator. The weird USP here being that it makes actually playable maps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnline co-operative play. Team up with a friend over teh interwebs to beat a pair of AI's on various set piece challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnline PVP. Mash your opponents, increase your rating, brag about it to everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTurn-based. This is not a real-time game. You play in turns, so you have to win by being a better tactician, not by clicking faster than the other guy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSee you in there soldier, bag 'em and tag 'em.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e4/0e495a972ce4b582f8dce8f8151eebda.jpeg", "website": "https://www.rubicondev.com/elwg/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 504, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Rubicon Development", "Rubicon"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rubicon Mobile", "Rubicon Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
