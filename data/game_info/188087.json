I don't think this is actually that fun of a game if I'm honest, but forcing myself to actually finish something was a great experience! \u00a0Thanks for checking it out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe8bf5ffff3789156d01ade2e0d6b22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drew_G"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
