I actually did it in a course, and it's missing a few improvements, so I'll try to bring it next updates so that it's at least stable (probably <em>between 1-2 updates</em>, I don't want to dwell too much on this, I need to do more than this, LOL).\u00a0 </p>\n<p>In any case, this is definitely a <em>trial version</em> and it doesn't have much, so don't expect much from <strong>a simple game of shooting with a spaceship and earning points</strong> and that's it. That is all. <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, by the way.
