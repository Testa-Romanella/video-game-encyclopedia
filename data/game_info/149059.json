And every other Goblin in the place... Best be sure to take care of them first.  </p>\n<p>Goblin Gold Mine is a multiplayer archery game where up to 12 players are dumped in a battle ground to see who gets to 5 kills first, but be careful! When you die, your kills gets reset to 0. Nada. Zip. You'll have to climb that ladder all over.</p>\n<p> Be the first to claim victory and the gold shall be yours!*<br/></p>\n<p>This game uses Unity's included networking, and therefore I have to charge for it.  Sorry, but if I get too many people on at once, either I pay more or you get kicked.  The price is currently only $2, but will be going up when final release rocks around. So get in quick!</p>\n<p>Please also note that because this is a Beta, I haven't fully implemented some features.  <strong>You will need to press Alt + F4 (or Cmd + Q for Macs) to quit!!</strong></p>\n<p>*gold not included in this build of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f770ba73f5f85e0e868539b7507db25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FFS"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
