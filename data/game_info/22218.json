Every time you play, it\u2019s a different experience generated and managed by a digital game master. You never know which monsters, potions, spells, and equipment you will encounter along the way, and it\u2019s up to you to make the most of it. <br/><br/>Sometimes, you\u2019ll charge into battle, wielding powerful weapons and armor, while other times you\u2019ll execute a carefully planned sequence of spells to annihilate your foes. <br/><br/>The object of the game is always the same: Reach the bottom level of the dungeon, retrieve the Lyre of Electra, and return to the surface. One of the charms of Minotaur\u2019s Maze is the surprising variety of situations you\u2019ll find yourself in. No two games are ever the same. <br/><br/><strong>Minotaur\u2019s Maze was designed for VR from the start.</strong><br/><br/>It\u2019s streamlined \u2014 complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to learn in a few minutes. It feels good to play for 20-40 minute sessions (about how long we like to wear an HMD), and you can probably beat it in a few hours \u2014 once you \u201cget gud\". <br/><br/>No nausea! We specifically used a third person perspective of a minature world because it eliminates gross artificial movement, awkward teleporting mechanics, and other problematic issues with VR. <br/><br/>Multi-Input Device. You can play with hand controls or a gamepad, using a VR HMD or a standard monitor or TV, depending on what you prefer. <br/><br/>3D Audio. The sounds of the dungeon are positioned using binaural 3D, to create a totally immersive experience.<br/><br/>This is a game that works in VR - because it was designed for VR - from day one.<br/><br/><br/>UPDATES:<br/>Apr 14, 2017 - 0.13, Made bugfixes based on user feedback.
