I experimented with the terrain editor making various mountains and hills. I also changed the textures to fit the winter theme. I also made some bushes around the map and some nice trees around the map.</p>\n<p>To play this game, all you need to use is WASD for movement and point your camera with your mouse for the direction you would like to move. Be sure to not fall off the edge of the map, as you will fall into the unity void. Also if you are noticing you are not moving on the screen left click with your mouse on the screen to let your character move.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e1eb1646a86915a87fdf3a37653c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ReeceTheDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
