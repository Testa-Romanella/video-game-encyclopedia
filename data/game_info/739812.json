You are Samual, a simple farmer that lives in a small abandoned town called First Valley. You live there with your daughter Sam who is the light of your world. One day you are attacked and your daughter is taken away from you!</p>\n<p>You are now on a grand adventure to save your daughter. While you are on this journey you will explore a vast a diverse universe, make new friends (and enemies) , and hopefully find some Gem Worms!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>Some of the biggest inspiration for this game are as Lisa the Painful RPG, Earth bound, Undertale, and other games like those. Just like a lot of kids growing up I wanted to make video games. It was only till a few years ago that I realized great game can be made by small teams or even by one person. So this has been a passion project I have been working on the past 3 years or so. If you would like to try it out before you want to back the project and see what it is about. There is a link above with the download for the demo. The demo is the first 20% of the game for free! The demo will stay available even after the game launches. Do note that the game is still in development and may still have issues when you play the demo. If you find any glitches or misspellings, do not hesitate to reach out and let me know.</p>\n\r\nLets meet some Characters!\r\n\r\n\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Samual-</p>\n<p>Samual is the main protagonist in this great adventure. He might not look like much, talk much, fight well, or dress cool. But!!!..........</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Ace Stud-</p>\n<p>Samual's new best friend and the best pilot you will ever meet. And watch out! This stud might hit you with his hot flinger guns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Barrel Elf-</p>\n<p>A strong foe that is pretty well protected by that barrel. never leave home with out your knife kids.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Doug-</p>\n<p>A Doug has got to dig!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>Cromp-</p>\n<p>Cromp is not a rich or a poor kid. Somewhere right in the middle. Cromp finds it hard to fit in the play ground and at the dinner table. But that won't bring him down! Cromp is super passionate about two \u00a0things. Making people smile and slamming away on the bonker drums. he practices every moment he is not a school or being pestered by his 23 siblings. One day he wants to start a band at try to make people smile all over the universe. His dad laughs at him and just wants him to join the family business of snark shaving. But nothing will stomp on this Cromps dreams. He is going to keep grinding and get better every day. He hopes to one day to make you and everyone else out there smile.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Most RPG's either are isometric of they are platformers. at the very begging of making this game I knew I wanted to be able to have both in my game. For games that have just one of these I still think are great, but having both adds a nice bit of variety and is an integral part to the story.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0This game has turn based combat! (Wow what a revolutional FeAtUrE!) Most combat situations will change fight to fight, depending on location and who you fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>After every fight you will be given the option to either Spare or Finish your enemies.</p>\n<p>Depending on what you do will change the world around you in a variety of ways. Just because you think it is the right decision, doesn't mean it was a good one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<strong><strong>\n\r\nTeam\r\n\r\n<p>Right now there is only one person working the game......me (Ronald Kinzer) aka Gordy Games.</p>\n<p>I am not apposed to eventually working with other people to work on the game. I am just waiting to see what the funds look like before I start hiring people. There are some people I have already have in mind have spoken to that I would love to hopefully bring onto a team.</p>\n<p>To say I have done everything on the game would be a lie. I have \u00a0had some help from close friends help me with some art and music.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>\u00a0Baxter \"BmSonic\" McRoberts-</p>\n<p>Song: bax is feeling / other various music advice\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cub Art and Design-</p>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><p><strong><strong><strong>Cover art.<br/></strong></strong></strong></p>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T04:56:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/90331d255eef6c4de58a153c26786604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gorrdy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
