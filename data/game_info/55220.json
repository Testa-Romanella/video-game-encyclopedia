{"id": 55220, "slug": "dizzy", "name": "Dizzy", "name_original": "Dizzy", "description": "<p>The Dizzy series of computer games, published by Codemasters, was one of the most successful European computer game brands of the late 1980s. The games featured a central figure: an intelligent egg-like creature called Dizzy. The games would typically involve Dizzy trying to save his friends and family, the Yolkfolk, often from the schemes of his nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks.</p>\n<p>Most of the games in the series were platform games, with an emphasis on puzzle solving, similar to graphic adventures. Dizzy would roam around various fairytale-like locations, collecting objects, interacting with other characters, and solving logical puzzles. Rather than jumping in the conventional platform-game way, Dizzy would somersault and roll around the landscape; hence the name \"Dizzy\". The eight games which follow this style, usually referred to as the arcade adventures, are considered the 'core' games in the series; however, several spin-off titles were released, including Fast Food, Kwik Snax and Dizzy Down the Rapids.</p>\n<p>Four games in the series were included in the Top 50 best games of all time in a special issue of Your Sinclair magazine in 2004.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7fa3468c87388f082570dc9bfaf61fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
