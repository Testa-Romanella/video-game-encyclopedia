TRY PHOSPHORUS VERSION: \u2500\u25bahttp://phosphorus.github.io/#74221074\u25c4\u2500 S/X - throttle || arrows - roll/pitch || A/D - yaw || C - inside view space - decrease speed || R - missile || W - show/hide wheels slide to rotate camera (only outside the plane) To TAKE OFF EASILY press S and then DOWN ARROW Note: 2nd airstrip is far forward, use minimap (these white dots on the bottom of screen) and land if possible Thumbnail created by @Tildo Thanks to @sticku for introduction to the matrix rotation. v2.8 - 25th May - more realistic physics, runway filled in. v2.7 - 6th May - plane under water becomes blue, small bug fixed v2.6 - 18th April - ...RIVER!!! :D see it on right side from the plane v2.5 - 13th December - Wings also collides with mountains, improved physics v2.4 - 11th December - FILLED MOUNTAINS! Also a little improved control and changed vector graphics so now it looks well on phosporus too. v2.3 - 19th October - different hill heights, rocket can break rocks v2.2 - 25th September - better looking and working rocket, hud in place is rotating (inside view) v2.1 - 24th September - contrasting plane color, transparent windows in plane, repaired glitches (physics, shadows) - as many as I saw, tell me if I missed any of tchem, head moving inside plane v2.0 - 20th September - \"glitching?\" inside view, press 'C' - note: this update took me more than the rest of this project :O v1.9 - 7th September - new physics - gliding / rudder v1.8 - 6th September - missile - R to fire, some glitches repaired v1.7 - 5th September - space helps slow down, another airstrip, upgraded fire (with sorting), simple minimap v1.6 - 5th September - improved physics and crashing system, simple fire, again small bug repaired with culling v1.5 - 4th September - wheels (press W), culling for plane added, for hills repaired, air density gets lower when going higher v1.4 - 3rd September - physics on rocks improved, repeatable world generator, face culling v1.3 - 2nd September - rudder control, upgraded physics, graphics v1.2 - 1st September - moveable wings, possible to roll-over v1.1 - 31st August - release version, plane with physics and shadow, hills, sun, fog effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b84cf982d4d59dafbba8983c758a4d4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GottaGoFast64"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
