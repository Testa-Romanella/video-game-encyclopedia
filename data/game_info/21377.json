On its way to an island marked on the map, his plane crashes, but the brave traveler survives. He wakes up to find himself in a giant maze that he must escape from to reach the treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605 GAMEPLAY \u2605 <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour task will be to help the nice and unlucky character find a way out of this difficult situation by guiding him through the maze and, hopefully, taking him to the treasure chest. To do that, you will need all your concentration, logic, memory and patience. It\u2019s a long and treacherous journey through a labyrinth where you will need to find keys to exit doors. You will encounter all kinds of obstacles, such as stones, plants, rivers, portals, crates and much more. You will also need to find many items that will help you overcome these obstacles. <br/>\r\nEach labyrinth is a unique exciting puzzle where you can easily get lost. However, if you find yourself in a dead end with no way out, you can always restart the game and try again. Sometimes even the weather will be a problem, making it hard for Mr. Fatty Maze to navigate through the maze in mist, during a blizzard, storm or night time. <br/>\r\nThe game offers an exciting atmosphere, colorful graphics and animations, great music and sound effects, adventures in locations covered with jungle, ice and sand, over 50 types of levels, over 25 types of game items and obstacles and an amazingly beautiful and mysterious world! But the most important feature is the main character who changes depending on the maze conditions. <br/>\r\nYou will be surprised to see how much better your memory and ability to solve logic puzzles will improve after beating the game! <br/>\r\nThe game has no level time limitations, but the faster and more efficiently you beat a level, the more points you will get to compare your score with that of your friends. <br/>\r\nThe game was created both for adults and their kids! <br/>\r\nThe level editor to share after the game is released.
