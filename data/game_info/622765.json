However, a broken walkie talkie informs them that a few humans are still alive and there's still hope for mankind survival.</p>\n<p>The player will switch between both characters, roaming through different paths and solving varied challenges, not only trying to find the other survivors but also uncovering, mystery by mystery, what truly happened. With their own special abilities, the characters will have to show their bravery and intelligence and unknowingly cooperate for their own salvation.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T04:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e64174e96784699043d4bb2745a1b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndreMoutinho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
