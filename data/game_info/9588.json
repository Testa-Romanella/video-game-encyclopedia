You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans.

Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign.<br/><br/><strong>Innovative command system: </strong>You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions.

Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although \"no plan survives contact with the enemy\".<br/><br/><strong>Officer progression: </strong>Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player.

Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if it\u2019s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early.<br/><br/><strong>Advanced Artificial Intelligence: </strong>You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. <br/><br/><strong>Terrain matters: </strong>Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields \u2013 everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. <br/><br/><strong>Beautiful maps: </strong>We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes.
