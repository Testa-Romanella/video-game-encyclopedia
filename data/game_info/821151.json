Some elements in the scene may help you (or maybe hinder) your way to the goal. Take a good look at the room and choose the best way to escape\u00a0 from it. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2699\ufe0f The mechanics/puzzles implemented are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\ud83d\udd04 Gravity Change:\u00a0</strong>You may not be able to go to\u00a0Platform 9\u00be at King's Cross Station if you hit a wall with enough resolution. However, gravity may change, allowing you to walk on a different side of the dice. This will also affect some objects on the scene.</li><li><strong>\ud83e\uddca Block:\u00a0</strong>Move it around the map by pushing or carrying it to activate other mechanisms, build stairs, block undesired events... There are two types of blocks:<ul><li><strong>\ud83c\udd93 Free: </strong>You can move it in any dimension,\u00a0 no rules, only the gravity law.</li><li><strong>\ud83d\udd12 Side-Locked:\u00a0</strong>You can only interact with these when the current side you're standing on is the one indicated by the value in the block itself.</li></ul></li><li><strong>\ud83d\udd18 Button</strong>: It needs to be pressed by a block, and it enables/disables some other mechanism in the room.</li><li><strong>\ud83d\udd25 Fire Torch:\u00a0</strong>You may find some torches spread around the map. It is said that if you light them all, something will happen.</li><li><strong>\ud83d\udca8 Air Streams: </strong>Some industrial fans produce\u00a0enough air to extinguish the fire from your torch. You may need to turn it off or take a detour if you want to get to the other side with some fire in your torch.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T06:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/687/68774ccff08a1383d3f7f9773d4d2eb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bernatmago", "josepdecid"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
