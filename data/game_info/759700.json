All you need to know is that you need to press and hold space to jump, and it is an endless runner style game that gets a bit harder incrementally. Although the project itself is very simple, this took me 7 months to devise and complete as I never made a game on unity before nor have I coded in C# before.</p>\n<p>Credit to SNK for some of the assets (Please do not sue me) and Oliver R for the music composition used in the main menu.
