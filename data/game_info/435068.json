Earth can still be saved but is heading to where it can no longer sustain life. It is your task to try and recover and Keep Earth Alive. At your disposal is several tools that will help you with this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Gardening but with Nukes</strong></p>\r\nInstructions\r\nGAIA PROTOCOL OBJECTIVE\r\n<ul><li>Earth is a nuclear wasteland, ravaged by war and is heading towards a point of where life can no longer be sustained.</li><li>Objective is to reach 100 Homeostasis of Earth.</li><li>If Homeostasis hits 0 then Earth has gone past the point of no return, and you game over.</li><li>If your Energy hits 0 you game over.</li></ul>\r\nCAMERA MOVEMENT\r\n<ul><li>You can control the Camera by using either WASD or Arrow Keys</li><li>You can change the Zoom of the Camera by using Q/E or Page Up/Page Down keys.</li></ul>\r\nTOOLS\r\n<ul><li>Power Plant: Generates Energy but causes Homeostasis to decay.</li><li>Atmospheric Plant: Takes energy but improves Homeostasis. Will cause atmosphere to stabilize and introduce back Clouds.</li><li>Water Plant: Generates Energy more efficiently but needs Water to be present in tile.</li><li>Scrubber: Turns Wasteland into Barren land, Barren can become Restored land if Clouds rain on it.</li><li>Fusion Plant: Highly advanced and efficient Energy production, can only be built on Restored land or land with a functioning Biosphere</li><li>Biomass Generator: Will create functioning Biosphere in Restored tiles. Biosphere tiles improve Earth's Homeostasis</li><li>Terraformer: Will raise Mountains around it.</li><li>Nuke: Will obliterate almost anything in the area of the blast.</li></ul>\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n<ul><li>Start by getting your energy source built up, I recommend building two power generators and one atmospheric plant.</li><li>Humans are hiding in shelters in the ruins of old world's larger cities.</li><li>When earth becomes stable enough the Humans will return out of these ruins and start settling earth again.</li><li>When this happens the Humans will start producing pollution again so be ready to deal with that.</li><li>Pollution spawned by the Human settlements will cause your work to be destroyed.</li></ul>\r\nNOTE\r\n<p>There's a known bug where Y coordinate when clicking on map might be a bit off. Sorry I couldn't fix it in time!<br/>Game was developed on Linux, with Visual Studio Code, C++, SFML and a lot of gusto.
