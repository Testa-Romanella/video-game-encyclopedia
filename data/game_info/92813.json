For the test assignment, you have been challenged to ransack a castle, the surrounding area and even the Bank of Kerovnia itself of all valuables. Are you up to it? Frankly we doubt it.<br/></p>\n<p>Magnetic Scrolls was a British video game developer active between 1984 and 1990. A pioneer of audio-visually elaborate text adventure games. It was one of the two largest and most acclaimed interactive fiction developers of the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The original game has been remastered and improved by Stand Games (with <br/>permission) and adapted for modern PCs and mobiles, with a vastly improved UI.<br/></p>\n<p>Features include:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Touch-Text Commands<br/>Tap \"links\" in the text to perform commands without typing.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Game specific word suggestion<br/>Tap suggested words from the <em>word bar </em>during input to save time.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sidebar Inventory<br/>All your things are conveniently listed in a sidebar. Drag and drop to use them or to apply them to things in the main text.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Dynamic Map<br/>No need to draw out the map, we do it for you. As you explore the game, the map page will expand. Tap any previous room on the map to \"fast-goto\" that location.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Quickly navigate with a handy compass gadget. It shows the available exits at all times, simply tap to move.</li></ul>\n<p>The new facilities make the original game fun and entertaining to play on modern devices. No more dead ends; the remaster has multi-level undo, save/load game and automatic undo from dying!</p>\n<p>There's also the original artwork, the animated artwork and new music from the original artist John Malloy (thanks John!).<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Find out more at http://strandgames.com</p>\n<p>See also:<br/>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guild_of_Thieves<br/>http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=bu2v2j5sqpf4usex<br/>http://msmemorial.if-legends.org/games.htm/guild.php</p>\n<p>System Requirements</p>\n<ul><li>Windows Vista or later.</li><li>Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) or later.</li><li>Recent\r\n 64bit Linux desktop (Ubuntu 16.04+, Fedora 25+, Debian 8+, Suse Leap \r\n42.2+, CentOS7, MiNT 18.1+, ElementaryOS 0.41, Manjaro 17.1 and similiar)</li></ul>\r\nSupport the Remastering Project\r\n<p>After fees, we get only about \u00a31 from each sale.
