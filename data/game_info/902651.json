Certainly more of a proof of concept than a finished game!</p>\n<p>To win, you need to complete 3 laps before any of the other vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>--Controls--</strong></p>\n<ul><li>AD, Left/Right Arrows, or Left Joystick L/R - Steer (relative to car's perspective)</li><li>S, Down Arrow, Joystick Down - Brake/Reverse</li><li>R - Reset Game</li><li>Escape - Quit Game</li><li>You don't need to hold forward \ud83d\ude09</li></ul>\n\n<p>The biggest inspiration for this was Lego Stunt Rally, which I loved as a kid. I wanted it to have a simple control scheme like Stunt Rally, however I made this in a different way. Whereas SR effectively steers for you and you mostly just need to control your speed, mine is the opposite. I opted to have the game \"hold down the forward button for you\", as I find that this works well in Mario Kart 8, but you are in charge of steering. Player and AI cars have the same movement capabilities, so the best way to win is optimise your steering and take corners tightly.</p>\n<p>I used the following tools while making this:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity - Game creation</li><li>Notepad++ - Programming</li><li>Wwise - Audio implementation</li><li>MagicaVoxel - 3D modelling and texturing</li><li>Cubase - Sound design<br/>\n</li><li>Blender - 3D mesh optimisation (to fix lighting and collision issues from meshes exported from MagicaVoxel)</li></ul>\n<p>I'm willing to hear feedback if you have any thoughts. I can't say for certain whether or not I'll expand on this project but I enjoyed making it, so time will tell!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T11:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d55/d55948b50af55a6a501650736f4e2d04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt J Hart"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
