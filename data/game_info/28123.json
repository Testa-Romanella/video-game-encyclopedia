The first is, in fact, a giant cannon that can launch projectiles through space, and which has allowed them to initiate a space programme which is, to say the least, incredible. The second is the development of a cloning machine that enables them to send explorers into the most hazardous situations without worrying too much about the potentially lethal risks. <br/>Armed with this innovative technological arsenal, the Lethis Academy of Space Sciences then decided to send a crack team to find mysterious artefacts on each of the planets in the solar system. These are the interplanetary adventures you will experience.Features<ul><li>Embark on the craziest exploration mission of your life<br/></li><li>Explore six unique planets<br/></li><li>Play five unforgettable explorers<br/></li><li>Hundreds of choices with their own illustrations!<br/></li><li>A new and original soundtrack with over 50 tracks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c8/9c8a9c551eb33c4a11f36cead019a018.jpg", "website": "http://www.lethisdd.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 34, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triskell Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital", "Triskell Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
