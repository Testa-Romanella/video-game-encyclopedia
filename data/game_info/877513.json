It also uses a machine-language subroutine made by Darren Atkinson to refresh the entire background from array of strings in the BASIC program.  Thanks to Greg Dionne for his insights into keyboard polling to allow for smooth non-stop input.</p>\n<p>Just in case you can't read the characters in the chunky Semigraphics-6 font of the MC-10, the controls are WASD. The pixel resolution of the screen is 64 X 48, and there is not provision for regular text being displayed.\u00a0 So unfortunately, the letters and numbers have to be rendered in the blocky pixels.\u00a0 It takes a little getting used to, but with a little time you will be recognizing the letters and numbers in their glorious 3X3 font.\u00a0 It's just one of the limitations we users of this quirky 8-bit micro are used to.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T15:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8f6ed81a62fd85f04d1daaf18194cf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jgerrie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
