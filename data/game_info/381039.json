From that point on, the project became a personal hobby, being independently developed solely for the passion of game development and video games. The game is nearing its completion in terms of the full version, but I figured it's time I could really use some feedback for the premise and quality of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T04:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba2324d80069e1de78b7702de75474f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oztech9"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
