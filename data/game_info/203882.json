Up is north, right is east, down is south, and left is west. If you fail, your spouse will love you a little less as represented by a heart disappearing. Fail four times and you will get divorced.<br/><br/>Also, bumping into the wrong flag will result in your spouse loving you less.<br/><br/>Keep the passion alive in your marriage as long as possible. Avoid that black cat!<br/><br/>Donations are nice, but not required.\u00a0Thanks. :-)<br/></p><p>Follow me on Twitter for more information:\u00a0https://twitter.com/derekrumpler</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c27169eefacc9a607b8677092dc48d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["derekrumplerjams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
