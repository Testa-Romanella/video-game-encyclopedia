The researcher will test your intelligence though various puzzle experiments that get harder and incorporate more elements as they go on. Will you be able to solve them all?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will be thrown into a simple puzzle game that involves moving blocks, levers, pressure plates, and other mechanics as you attempt to reach the exit of each level. Each level has a timer that keeps track of the time it takes for you to solve it and the game will save the 10 highest times for each level, so you can try to beat your quickest times.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T02:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b49593f3d745ef09d16a102cf494c6b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlagenShiki"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlagenShiki"], "esrb_rating": null}
