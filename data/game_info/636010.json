In this exhibition, you will find three ways of looking at cups: ceramic analysis, forming techniques, and 3D visualization.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This exhibition was first shared as a live event by the Tracing the Potter's Wheel project, travelling to Heraklion Archaeological Museum (Crete, Greece) and the Dutch Institute at Athens (Athens, Greece) in 2019. The material and multimedia displays have been recreated digitally so that it can be available more widely. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T07:48:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/cccbbb846a7d69316b60f5e910f85723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImmersiveHeritage"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
