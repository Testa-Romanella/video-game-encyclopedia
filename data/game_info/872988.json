{"id": 872988, "slug": "squirrel-day-alpha-05", "name": "Squirrel Day (Alpha 0.5)", "name_original": "Squirrel Day (Alpha 0.5)", "description": "<p>Squirrel Day is a VR Squirrel Game about climbing, collecting, and exploring. Collect the nuts in each level. Use trigger to grab branches. This is an Alpha prototype build showcasing physics climbing system (Gorilla Tag style locomotion) and testing tree polycount, collectible placement, and other prototype ideas (Frogger style level, The Robers backyard). <strong>Currently only works with Oculus HMDs. Tested on Quest 2 and Quest Pro using Link Cable and Air Link. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Env1: Return to Main is under playscape. Nuts are far apart on multiple (lower poly) trees, making this a longer level, requiring a lot of climbing to complete. <br/></p>\n<p>Env2: Return to Main is on playscape. Nuts are all on a single tree in the middle, and can be collected much faster.<br/></p>\n<p>Env3: Return to Main is on starting tree and nut tree across the street. Ground is lava, so seek checkpoints. All collectibles are in tree across the street. Cross street on power lines.<br/></p>\n<p>Env4: Return to Main is at the beginning and Past road, before river. This level is not complete and was more of a concept to try out. May not be possible to finish, and you may get knocked out of world if you get stuck on a vehicle.</p>\n<p>Env5: Return to Main is right in the middle of the yard.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T04:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/ceae260ff4c77851ff63988fae336dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GraniteTopGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
