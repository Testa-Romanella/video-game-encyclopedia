I recommend this game to anyone who likes a fun/hard racing game.<br/><br/>AppAdvice: If racing large trucks with gigantic tires is your thing, MonsterTruck Rally for the iPhone and iPod touch is sure to please.<br/><br/>TouchReviews: The 3D graphics are stunning and offers high quality gameplay. It also as all the right sound effects with brakes screeching and the trucks engine sounds.<br/><br/>AppSafari:  ...Monster Truck Rally is definitely a fun monster truck racing game\u2026The graphics of the game are pretty good- I appreciate the truck graphics themselves much more than the course graphics, though. The sounds and music are completely appropriate for a monster truck game- rock music, loud engines, etc. I really like the 3 different viewing options..<br/><br/>AppSmile: MonsterTruck Rally is a new racing title that had us muddying up our iPhone screens in no time flat.\u2026Graphically, MonsterTruck Rally is impressive.  The tracks are very well designed, all sporting unique environments.  The trucks look huge and imposing with 3D flare.  Our favorite aspect of the game was how the trucks interact with the surroundings.  Launching of jumps or hitting obsticals can create some serious air-time. Landing back on the ground will throw the track into a bounce fest.  We loved these physics based visuals.<br/><br/>AppVersity: When I first entered the Career mode, the first thing I noticed was the amount of polish that the developers have put into the game. The 3D environment and cars look beautiful as you race down the track. The wheels turn like they should, and objects on the track do not allow the truck to simply pass through them. The cockpit view is very similar to that of Real Racing\u2019s<br/><br/>TheAppera: \u2026This makes this game very nice, both graphically and in gameplay. One can truly appreciate this game as pioneering a new genre of racers on the iPhone. <br/><br/>****************************************<br/><br/><br/>Choose your Monster Truck between Total Destroyer,Monster Crusher,T-Rex Butcher,Sasquatch and Black Mamba!<br/>Make the others eat your dust!
