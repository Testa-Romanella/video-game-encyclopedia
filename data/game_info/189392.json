Small as you may be, this doesn't discourage you from dreaming to be a bigger droplet.\u00a0 As you consume those that stand in your way, you watch your self grow. But don't let your ego blind you, as there are always others out there, bigger and better than you, waiting to grow by consuming you. </p>\r\nHow To Play \r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Movement</strong>: The player follows a the mouse courser.\u00a0 Just move the mouse to get the player to move.</li><li><strong>Change Colors</strong>: Left click will change the player color to white, and right clicking will change the player color to black.</li></ul>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>Players consume other circles that are smaller than themselves. If the circle is the same color as the player circle, then the player will grow slightly. If they are opposite colors, then they will shrink slightly. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Consuming a circle, regardless of color, will add progress to the level bar at the bottom of the screen. The higher the level you reach, the more enemy circles that will spawn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c2/2c2b1409e9affd1bf4395e9177f33938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ManBeardGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
