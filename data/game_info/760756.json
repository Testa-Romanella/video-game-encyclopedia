Expect many glitches that can ruin games and unfair scores.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>On the board, there are many types of spots you can land on, which are</p>\n<p>\"Good\" spots, which grant you 5 pepperonis.</p>\n<p>\"Bad\" spots, which remove you 5 pepperonis.</p>\n<p>\"Time Travel\" spots, which make you progress to the next step of the giant pizza board's decomposition.</p>\n<p>\"Golden Hat\" spots, which grant you a Golden Hat if you have at least 50 pepperonis.<br/></p>\n<p>Golden Hat spots are only available when the Pizza board is completely decomposed and moist. However you will still be able to see where they'll appear on the board before you reach the decomposed stage.</p>\n<p>Golden Hats let you win the game if you have more of them than other players.<br/></p>\n<p>After one round, you'll play one of four mini-games to win pepperonis (up to 10 of them). The better you do at the mini-games, the more pepperonis!<br/></p>\n<p>After 10 rounds, the game ends and the winner takes all!</p>\n\n<p><em>It is recommended to play with real players rather than the bots, as they're not particularily good at the minigames...</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>Game made by <strong>Mr. Sauceman </strong>for the Pizza Tower Calzone Game Jam<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Captain Spaghet.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T05:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f90/f903397de55b62ceacd77d5a15d6a1cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Sauceman"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
