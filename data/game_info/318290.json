The species has been infected with a currently un-named disease that can completely mutate the Stalker into unimaginable creatures.<br/>This is part of the theme for the game, that being evolution and how corruption can kill a society over time, making it into a cult-like civilisation.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the development, we have a discord server!
