You can play a \"solo\" game (vs an AI-driven car) or multiplayer, but the tactic is only one: fast in the straight, careful in turns!<br/>The basic requirement for any AR experience is the ability to create<br/>and track a correspondence between the real-world space the user<br/>inhabits and a virtual space where you can model visual content - the<br/>track.<br/><br/>To experience the best from slotc.AR, follow these simple hints:<br/><br/>- World tracking involves image analysis, which requires a clear image.<br/>Ensure lighting conditions are sufficient and stable (low reflection),<br/>and try to select surfaces with enough visible details.<br/>- Allow time for plane detection to produce clear results. Plane<br/>detection results vary over time: as the plane remains in the scene over<br/>time, slotc.AR refines its estimate of position and extent.<br/><br/>In order to successfully play multi-player races, the process is a bit<br/>more involved: starting from iOS 12, an AR experience can be shared<br/>between multiple devices. The steps are listed below:<br/><br/>1. Run the app on the master device. You can look around the local<br/>environment, and tap to place the starting piece. 2. Run the app on a<br/>second device. On both device screens, a message indicates that they<br/>have automatically joined a shared session. 3. The other device displays<br/>a message indicating that it has received the map. Wait until the track<br/>is shown on the second device, or tap the \u2277 button on the master device.<br/>Make sure the other device is in an area that the first device visited<br/>before sending the map, or has a similar view of the surrounding<br/>environment. When that process succeeds, both devices show virtual<br/>content at the same real-world positions, the track can be completed,<br/>and the race started.<br/><br/>The connection between peers player is automatic: as soon as one of the<br/>player correctly maps the environment and place the first piece of the<br/>track, he acquires \"master\" status. The master builds the track, chooses<br/>race type, and governs the flow of the game (he can start another race<br/>on the same track, change track/location...).<br/><br/>Up to eight players can share the AR experience: two compete, the others<br/>are spectators; when the race ends, and a new one is triggered, a<br/>spectator can take over the previous player and substitute him. You can<br/>organise a tournament, with multiple races on same or different track.<br/><br/>Good luck and... good racing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T04:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eefb49aca974e169512dafc800db772_DtIVYMq.jpg", "website": "https://www.bonamsoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
