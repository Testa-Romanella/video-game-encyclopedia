{"id": 855974, "slug": "lost-traveler", "name": "Lost Traveler", "name_original": "Lost Traveler", "description": "<p>Lost Traveler is a game about, well... a lost traveler. <br/></p>\n<p>It was inspired by Slay The Spire and Inscryption with an additional feature where you can carry as many cards in your hand as you have fingers (some events can make you lose 1).</p>\n<p>When it's your turn, you draw 3 cards, with 3 cards you usually need to figure out how to counter the opponent which is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>During a battle you should be able to move the cards around with the mouse's middle stick. this gave me the most problems out of everything in this game.</p>Inbattle info<p> The enemy is about to attack and inflicts direct damage to the player for the amount displayed.</p><p> The enemy is about to defend itself this turn, this means it'll be harder to break the enemy. You will also not be able to hurt the enemy until its defences are down.</p><p> The enemy will restore its health, the amount is again dependent on the number.</p><p>The enemy will poison the protag. It'll last the amount of turns marked right next to the icon. Poison makes the player lose 2 HP, so if you get 15 poison, you'll get 30 HP worth of damage done to you across 15 turns.</p><p>In order to stun the monster, you must strike it this amount of time with any weapon. For example, if you see this icon with a 2 next to it, that means you must hurt the enemy twice, easy right? This is why you want to stock up on low cost weapons.<br/></p><p>In order to stun the monster, you must deal this amount of damage in a single blow. This is why axes are actually useful because they deal the most damage in the game. For example, if you see this icon with a 16 next to it, that means you must use any weapon that deals atleast 16 points of damage. The wooden pike is enough for this example BTW.</p>All you have to do to stun the enemy is to simply attack and that's all it takes to break him. This value runs along the HP of the enemy, so simply use all your weapons at once this turn and it'll eventually prevent the enemy from attacking. For example, if you see this icon with the number 35 next to it, that means you must deal 35 damage this turn, it's as simple as that.<br/>\n<p><strong>Please read before starting!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It was made specifically for the accessibility jam especially the jam's theme hand tremors + the optional theme \"Chilled\", so this game plays a lot slower than my other games.<br/></p>\n<p>To perform any action in Lost Traveler, you must click the card/icon/whatever and hold it for 1 second. Though once clicked, it stays clicked (even if the cursor moves away) until the player releases the mouse button or enter. This is my way to verify if someone misclicked and make it easy for him to validate his choice. I also made sure to be very lenient with what can be clicked, the cards are huge for example. <br/></p>\n<p>Enter, Left mouse button and Right mouse button all work! You also select things with the mouse's cursor!</p>\n<p><strong>This was made in 7 days (Didn't really work on this for 3 days) and with a game engine that is prone to glitches for things that are more complex, so bugs are to be expected.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Also HTML5 sucks, if text doesn't display correctly in your browser and the text goes outside the cards, there's nothing I can do about it, this is a fault of your browser. Switch to the latest version of Firefox.<br/></p>\n<p>Some missing content:</p>\n<p>An Inscryption-esque token system with ally characters that would both act as meat shields and fight for you. I didn't have enough time to finish this up. This is also what the icon with the 2 men is for.</p>\n<p>There are magic weapons coded ingame, but they're inaccessible.</p><p>I planned to add relics ingame.</p><p>Oh yeah the tutorial is not actually a tutorial, I didn't have enough time to finish it.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm just letting ya know because past this jam I don't think I want to update this anymore, so LMK if you want me to keep working on this game.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Sky background by <strong>Bart</strong> from opengameart.org</li><li>Enemy sprites by <strong>DiCocco</strong> from opengameart.org</li><li>Game Over screen by <strong>Justin Nichol </strong>from opengameart.org</li><li>Battle music by <strong>Matthew Pablo</strong> from opengameart.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:50:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa7142a83169285e5cdad3e2bc49bcb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CyberRobotnix"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
