For single-player, you can play a mode called Progressive, in which you start small and with no upgrades and abilities, but after you collect coins in each round, you can visit\u00a0 the Shop and buy upgrades from the 80+ items available in the skill tree and become bigger and stronger over time!</p>\n<p>There is also an Arcade mode in which you don't have the persistent upgrades but instead there are temporary buffs and debuffs falling from time to time, and you have to try to get or avoid them in order to save your HPs to reach the highest score!</p>\n<p>\u00a0In two-player, you can either try to beat your high score with a friend in Co-op mode, or battle each other to see who's the better player in Versus mode.</p>\n<p>The game currently is in development stage and needs many improvements before being released in the store, however I'll be glad if you play this game and let me know what you think about it in the comments or reaching me at hess.gha@gmail.com.
