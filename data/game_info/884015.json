This is the tradition, the tradition of every child who lives in the midst of war, who places so much hope in his favela ball.</em></p>\n<p><em>The strength of hope transformed this child, who now, with his ball, has the power to change, take your ball and end the war.</em></p>\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<p><em>The football tradition, the favela tradition, the tradition of hope that things will get better, this war has to end.</em></p>\n<p><em>Shanty Town Ball is a very special game, which sheds light on a very important topic, present in communities in the state of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, where I live, </em><em>and unfortunately in many places around the world.</em></p>\n<p><em>The war that kills innocent people and puts an end to so many dreams, the reality of these communities most of the time is a war climate, but hope never dies,\u00a0  </em><em>and in Brazil, known as the country of football, it's no wonder that we have thousands of children who dream of becoming soccer players, which is why the Shanty Town Ball also\u00a0  </em><em>addresses this topic of hope that children living in difficult situations in Brazil place in the soccer ball, in the chance to change their lives, not just for their children\u00a0  </em><em>or their parents . also, they often tighten their pockets but run after that dream that in many cases, the father or mother also had as a child, but did not succeed\u00a0</em><em>conclude. Anyway, the Shanty Town Ball brings a boy and a ball, which together have the ability to end the war in their community, the power is activated when the boy </em><em>jumps on top of the ball, then we have the drones of the green and blue industries that they dispute the coins and are at war, and in the middle of that there is our boy who dreams of being </em><em>a soccer player, the mission is to end the war, how? This answer I leave for you to discover. In addition to coins, we also have hearts that appear randomly,\u00a0  </em><em>here is a tip, to increase the player's blood, these hearts appear in specific places, such as in front of the school, in front of the hospital, etc.\u00a0</em><em>light on the need to have a hospital, school, among others, in the life of each child so that he can survive, I even thought of some updates for the future, where\u00a0  </em><em>our boy (player) could \"enter\" these places and have more adventures .</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many ideas come to mind for this game, I intend to add many things, always passing on a positive message, more adventures, but effects, powers, enemies, try to turn into a game all the barriers that try to prevent children from fulfilling their dreams, to they might face in the game and somehow enable them to face it in real life. Bringing up the need for more schools in the favelas, hospitals, sports, creating a true favela game, full of adventures and challenges, just like in real life, around the tradition of football and the hope that never dies.</p>\n\n<p>Credit Assets:</p>\n<p>#City of action pack</p>\n<p>https://anokolisa.itch.io/action</p>\n<p>#legacy vania pack village</p>\n<p>https://anokolisa.itch.io/legacy-vania-pack-vilage</p>\n<p>#The boy</p>\n<p>https://www.gameart2d.com/the-boy---free-sprites.html</p>\n<p># particle pack</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack</p>\n<p>#GUI</p>\n<p>https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-jungle-cartoon-gui</p>\n<p># animated explosion</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-animated-explosion-sprite-pack/</p>\n<p>#GrafitPixel</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-graffiti-constructor-pixel-art/</p>\n<p>#Drone</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-drones-pack-pixel-art/?num=1&amp;count=8&amp;sq=drone...</p>\n<p>#Missile</p>\n<p>https://kenney.nl/assets/tower-defense-top-down</p>\n<p>#Coin</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-game-coins-sprite-sheets/</p>\n<p>#Heart</p>\n<p>https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-underwater-world-2d-game-objects/</p>\n<p>#Side A side B industrial</p>\n<p>https://ollieberzs.itch.io/industrial-pack</p>\n<p>$Fonts</p>\n<p>https://ggbot.itch.io/kaph-font</p>\n<p>https://emhuo.itch.io/peaberry-pixel-font</p>\n<p>#Background music</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/midnight-explosion</p>\n<p># Sounds sfx</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/50-cc0-sci-fi-sfx</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/synthesized-explosion</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-0</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/bowling-ball-rolling</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/victory-victory-victory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad2/ad2bc3a2eba189152c866d19a0c04c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Miqu\u00e9ias Santos"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
