You are a newborn blob at the base of the great tree. You must climb to prove your worth, under the eyes of the goddesses. Collect parts of other animals, combining them in your own body to become the optimal creature!<br/><br/>Miscreation is a game about customizing a creature. Start as a small, defenseless blob. Grow legs, arms, a tail, a new head, wings and some big, nasty teeth - become your enemy's nightmare or a cute, cuddly creature. Thousands of possible combinations!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay takes place in a side-scrolling platformer world. Optimize your 8 body parts for characteristics like speed, defense or air time to get through each new environment. The only way to keep up with the competition is to evolve!<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the end of each stage of your journey, you\u2019ll be challenged by the guardian boss, which must be overcome to move on. Defeating your enemies has benefits, though: either regular enemies or bosses may drop parts for your evolves. Other evolve parts are found hidden around the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Miscreation\u2019s unique evolve mechanic is based on classic games like the E.V.O.: The Search for Eden (1992).<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T02:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9121a360353253a191f5290bcb8411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chronicle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chronicle"], "esrb_rating": null}
