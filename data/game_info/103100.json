Decided to go with Jojo's Bizarre Adventure for source material because I like JJBA, and I figure if I ain't allowed to monetize it no matter what, I may as well do something fun, you know?</p><p>\r\n\tV0.07\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA small overworld room has been built, it's not as decorated as I'd like it, but that should come SOONISH. I want this to feel like it was actually taken from a full game, even though it isn't. For now it's just an empty room where you as Jonathan can talk to (and then fight) Dio. Give it a shot!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tNext update: Probably a pause menu.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tV0.05\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAdded ACT and MERCY menu functionality, the bad news is I couldn't think of a way to defeat Dio in a pacifist run, so MERCY is pretty much just for fun, there is SOMETHING to do in the ACT menu though\u2026<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tV0.04\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDio can now die.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tV0.03\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGame is playable, you can die, Dio cannot. ACT, ITEM, and MERCY menus do not work yet.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43ef9011fe8960094e65f751e5452e6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Waldmann"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
