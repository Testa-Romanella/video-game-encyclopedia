With the theme of <strong>Out of Control</strong>, I decided to make a game about a fluttery, unpredictable moth that wants to meet her beloved lamp.</p>\n<p>The moth is constantly moving in random, out of control directions, and will be drawn towards any light sources. Along with a variety of other obstacles that both Moth and Candle have to avoid makes this short experience challenging &amp; unpredictable.</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at making a game with the Unity Game Engine! It's also a very different style of game than I would normally consider if it weren't for the theme.</p>\n\r\nCredits &amp; Thanks\r\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong> Most audio was found on http://freesound.org/</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong> Most images were found on Google Image Search (with \"Labeled for Free Use\" filter turned on). Some images from http://opengameart.org/. Pixel art was made by me.</p>\n<p>Thanks to...</p>\n<p><strong>Mark Brown</strong> for creating Game Maker's Toolkit and hosting these jams (and for allowing a 30 minute late submission period)</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly, Alex, Zach, and Sam</strong> for feedback, reviewing, and brainstorming ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>@kingscrown</strong> on the GMTK Discord for solving a programming issue I had. This game wouldn't have been completed without them.</p>\n<p><strong>Rick &amp; Nina</strong> from gamedev.tv for the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D course, which I completed in just over a month in preparation for this jam. I knew nothing at all about Unity before taking that course.</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong>, for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4ce22ff34dbdfe92bdcb3ad5d92c59b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["damon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
