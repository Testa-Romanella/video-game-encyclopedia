This is a <strong>super-short</strong> narrative adventure about kindness and bullying, inspired by the track \"Creature Lives\" off Mastodon's 2011 album\u00a0<em>The Hunter</em>. As such, the game's palette uses colors plucked from the album art of said album. The game is made in Bitsy, which is a <strong>really</strong> cool tool.</p>\n<p>Enjoy this quick jaunt into fandom!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e1478608e32f733eb8d2a33a69491e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cian Rice"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
