Milla possesses students and kills one of them by pretending to be that person. Michel and his friends must gather evidence, argue, and find out who is possessed by Mira.<h3> How to play the game</h3>As the game progresses and the story progresses, someone will die. Examine that person's body and the objects around them to collect evidence. Michel has a symptom called \"Memorize\", so you can check the evidence at any time by recalling it.<br/><br/>Once you've finished collecting evidence, it's time to start the \"discussion\" to find out who is possessed by the murderous ghost, Milla. Use the memorize you have collected to advance the discussion and find out who the killer is.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T03:21:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b83/b83d36b5795af4f6ec2ce8b7175a910d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Reijo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reijo"], "esrb_rating": null}
