The game state consists of a 2D grid spanning the  entire game window and all entities that are currently within the window.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nPseudo Physics Engine\r\n<p>The driving force of the simulation is the 2D grid. Each  entity updates it's own state through the state of the grid, i.e., a falling block will check the immediate space below to determine  it's next action. That is why I have opted to call this 'Pseudo physics'  rather than 'Real physics'.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nEntities\r\n<p>There are three (3) different entities available in the simulation each with their own rules.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nSand\r\n<p>Has gravity. Forms a pyramid shape with other sand entities. Sinks in water.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nStone\r\n<p>Stationary.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nWater\r\n<p>Has gravity.
