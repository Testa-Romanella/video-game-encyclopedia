As the player you interact with countless barkeepers with the sole intention of getting drunk and not having to attend the birthday of another wrinkly relative that tends to poke your cheeks a bit too harshly every time she sees you (yes even now that you are an adult. Terrible, am I right?). The more alcohol you drink the worse it gets (see what I did there?) and controlling your character becomes harder progressively. Who knows? You may even begin to hallucinate. Some drinks will make you drunk faster than others. Just apply some common sense to figure out what drink has more alcohol than the other one.</p>\n<p>Drinking actual alcohol while playing the game is strongly advised. To make it more immersive of course. Not to distract you from possible flaws in the writing and the game itself. Please drink responsibly and respect the legal drinking age in your country.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nW, A, S, DMovement<br/>A,DSelect drinkEInteractEsc\u00a0Open/Close options<br/>\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\nCEO, ProgrammingJunberGraphicsSturoDesign, MarketingHisfantorStory, DesignBelphegorMusicSteamdragon\r\n<p><strong>Have fun, lowercase_games</strong>\r\nTwitter\u00a0Reddit\u00a0Instagram\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a6b948e2123a9d42871f170b6fd95d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lowercase_games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
