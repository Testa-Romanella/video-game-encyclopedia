The keyboard will be handicapped in future releases.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Third alpha of this conceptual project. (far from being finished though)</p>\n<p>- 26 levels.<br/>- 3 basic visual styles.<br/>- 20 different obstacles.</p>\n<p>Main ideas to achieve:</p>\n<p>- Difficulty must rise. Also for the level length.<br/>- Secrets.<br/>- More music related to the different styles.<br/>- Many more obstacles and level variety.<br/>- Sound effects.</p>\n<p>I have some very interesting ideas I wan't to try in future updates, but if you have also please leave a comment. Is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Please consider support the project if you ejoyed it.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>Music:</p><p><em>Sunshower</em> by LATASHA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:02:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e43167d92631a93daad48423fdde63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["edupo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
