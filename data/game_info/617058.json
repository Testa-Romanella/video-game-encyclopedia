Play by yourself or with friend as a pair of spellcasting siblings against a colorful cast of foes. Individually, their magic is strong, but together, they dish out double the trouble!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, watch out! Not all spells synergize. Only with your powers <strong>joined together</strong> can you defeat the enemy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Single Player:</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse - Choose card</li></ul>\n<p>Two Players:</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong><strong>Player 1</strong><strong>Player 2</strong>Choose left cardALeft arrow key<br/>Choose middle cardW or SUp or Down arrow keyChoose right cardDRight arrow key\r\n\n<p><strong>Credits (follow us on Twitter!):</strong></p>\n<p>Andrew So (Programmer)</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/lainwave<br/></p>\n<p>Sarinda Samarasinghe (Programmer and Sound)</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ucf_esketit<br/></p>\n<p>Joyce Hu (Art and Graphic Design)</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/joylychi<br/></p>\n<p>Alice Chen (Art)</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/alcie20<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to SilvaGunner for the music, and to those checking our game out as well!
