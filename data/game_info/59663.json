For the first time ever a game uses laser scan data not only as base for modelling, but actually as part of the graphics thanks to state of the art technologies that allows to render millions of points in real time. The point cloud data combined with conventional polygonal meshes and latest shading techniques provide the perfect environment for the accurate yet fun focused vehicle physics.<br/><br/><strong>GAME MODES</strong><br/><ul><li>Time Attack<br/></li><li>Arcade (AI vs)<br/></li><li>Multiplayer</li></ul><br/><strong>RELEASE</strong><br/>I'm working full time on this project and targeting Q2 2018 for Early Access release.<br/><br/>I'll release a playable demo for free so the ppl can give it a go and share their thoughts at the same time a crowdfunding campaign takes off, somewhere around May/June.<br/>That means the development will be tied to the campaign success and if it fails that will be it. Last time I failed the campaign but I kept on and developed Tokyo Warfare, basically with my scarce savings to show the Community I can develop what I promise, yet, doing so without a proper funding wears you completelly so won\u00b4t happen again.<br/><br/>Please join and share if you like the project. <br/><br/>Best.<br/><br/>Pablo.<br/><br/>Clip Music: GRGE<br/>Vehicle physics core: Ravel Tammeleht", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a8e194d011d001fb7031c5a820c7c25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pablo Vidaurre Sanz"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pablo Vidaurre Sanz"], "esrb_rating": null}
