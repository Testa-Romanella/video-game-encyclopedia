The player moves along a randomly generated map, beating levels, collecting gifts from elves, and buying upgrades at elven shops. The final level is a high score mode, where children will respawn until the player runs out of gifts, and the objective is to obtain the highest amount of points possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>RETRO: We mixed low-quality assets with finely-designed arts assets to remind of the past where resources were scarce, fitting with the retro theme. Some music assets also use a retro style. Furthermore, the verse from which we based the theme of our game is from a song written in 1934, which is very much retro. This goes without accounting for the genre of the game: roguelike, which debuted in the 1980s, fitting perfectly with the retro period</p>\n<p>BLINDNESS: Map nodes that haven't been explored yet are shadowed out, hence blindness.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0Sassou#6815,\u00a0anise#5360 (Elaine Chen)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0ammsapphire#0474 (Ammara Khalid)</p>\n<p>Composer: Mai-chan#1867 (Miles \"Chuunibyou\" Yalzin)</p>\n<p>Link to Source Code:\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/MGuo763/KuriusHacksCE2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T04:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d5611809900c1be051a7cd1a4a3c6fe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A-Jar-Of-Peanuts"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
