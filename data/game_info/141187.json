{"id": 141187, "slug": "general-princess", "name": "General Princess", "name_original": "General Princess", "description": "<p>Sick and tired of being the victim of frequent kidnappings, Princess Plumcot of the Palmtree Province decides that the best offense is a powerful defense!</p>\n<p>As a Captain under her command in the Palmtree Defense Squad, work to fend off the Saur Corps and make sure that Plumcot never gets kidnapped again.</p>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t find the exact quote now, but\u00a0<em>General Princess</em>\u00a0was inspired by Anita Sarkeesian mentioning how she\u2019d like to see a game where a princess rescues herself. This isn\u2019t that exact idea made manifest; rather, here, the princess attempts to prevent the need to be rescued in the first place.</p>\n<p>Work on this game started in late 2016 and had originally been planned to be that year\u2019s Holiday Card, but due to health problems, I postponed the whole project until 2017. When I picked up work again, the biggest change I made was the addition of Princess Sayre.</p>\n<p>As with the previous Holiday Cards, I decided to make this game featuring a whole new genre (tower defense) and game engine (GameMaker), rather than retread what I had done before. Learning the ins and outs of GameMaker proved to be frustrating at times, and yet it wound up impressing me with its versatility and ease of use. There are some wonky aspects to this game, but I think I did the best I could with my limited time and resources.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy this long overdue third Holiday Card. Happy Holidays!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Defend the Palmtree Province with up to five unit types!</li><li>At least as many Saur Corps unit types to battle!</li><li>Another mediocre original soundtrack by R.
