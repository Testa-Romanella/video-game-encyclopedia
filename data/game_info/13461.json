This is the fifth main installment in Capcom\u2019s acclaimed franchise Resident Evil.  <br />\nThe story follows Chris Redfield, the protagonist of the original Resident Evil, and his partner Sheva Alomar. As the members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, they are tasked to intercept an illegal bioweapon trade in Kijuju, Africa. Upon arrival, they find out that Kijuju is infected by Las Plagas, parasites that turn its carriers into zombie-like creatures.   <br />\nThe game is notable for being a departure from the series survival horror roots towards more action-oriented gameplay style. The other significant innovation in the series brought with Resident Evil 5 is cooperative multiplayer for two players. There are many situations during the game that requires two players cooperation therefore if in singleplayer the second characters is controlled by AI.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2009-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/974/974342a3959981a17bdbbff2fd7f97b0.jpg", "website": "http://www.residentevil.com/5/", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 273, "owned": 4869, "beaten": 1591, "toplay": 144, "dropped": 317, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 604, "ratings_count": 1542, "suggestions_count": 684, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 1552, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A", "Mercenary Technology"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
