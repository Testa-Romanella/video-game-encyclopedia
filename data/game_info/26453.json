Choose your favorite \n      team and basketbrawl across the globe to become the undisputed World \n      Champions. Play on your own or with a friend, and see if you can beat \n      the leaders of the HoopWorld global ranking. Are you ready?\n    </p><p>\n      Long ago, a lost civilization called the Elders, who worshipped the \n      magical power of Nature, built a network of sacred temples around the \n      world. Millennia have since passed, and the temples lie in ruins. But \n      their energy still resonates from the land, attracting adventurers from \n      distant lands. Drawn by the unknown force, friends have begun to rebuild \n      the ruins into ball courts, knowing only that they must relive the \n      time-honored test of spirit of the Elders: the game now known as \n      basketball.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
