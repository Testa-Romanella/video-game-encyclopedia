{"id": 167210, "slug": "one-swing-wonder", "name": "One Swing Wonder", "name_original": "One Swing Wonder", "description": "<p>One Swing Wonder was made in two days by a single developer for the Unreal Engine Feb 2016 game jam.</p><p>What Is It ?</p><p>One Swing Wonder is a physics mini-golf game taken up a notch. Fantastical world, weird puzzles, difficult shots, and the best part it...the only way to progress is a hole in one.</p><p>The game is feature complete, but it's missing a final polish pass for audio/UI, which I'm unable to do this weekend due to other obligations. It does have a complete course (Front and Back 9, 18 total holes) and I'd love to see your scores </p><p>What Are The Controls ?</p><p>Mouse Controls most of the action. Pan around with the mouse to aim, click once to enter fire mode. A power bar will appear on your screen, when the power bar is at a level you would like, click again to hit the ball.</p><p>THE LOOK DIRECTION OF THE MOUSE/CAMERA ALTERS HOW YOU HIT THE BALL! Looking up hits up. This is needed for several shots.</p><p>P/Escape - In game menu.</p><p>AFTER HITTING THE BALL:<br/>T - Abandons your current ball and Gets you a new ball. If one of your non-controlled balls hit the cup, you still get credit (it's still a hole in one)! So don't hesitate to fire off as many shots as you'd like.<br/>Space Bar - Bunny hop after hitting the ball. Allows you to clear other balls that may be in your way/help on some shots (note that hopping with the ball is not necessary for any shot).</p><p>Any Known Issues ?</p><p>Normal physics bugs. Ball sometimes explodes/jumps for no reason, clipping can be a problem at high speeds.<br/>The main menu indicates that the number is your best number. It isn't, it's the last number you got. I may fix this if I can find time before the deadline.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/882/882e0e2ec23eecd72315fcf75e692560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crackpotgumption"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
