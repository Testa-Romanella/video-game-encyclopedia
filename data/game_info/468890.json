Well, in VoxChazz there's simply no time for that! In\u00a0contrast to classic chess, the intention of the game is to force you to make mistakes. Both players have just 6 seconds to move a piece. By capturing opponent's piece you get certain amount of points (the king can be captured as well). First player to get 30 points wins the game. There is also a combo increased by removing\u00a0 opponent's pieces which\u00a0multiplies newly obtained points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a9ac28c863752010c01204d0d785ec2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlockMaster320"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
