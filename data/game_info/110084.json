Enemies spawn from random locations outside the screen area, making the center of the screen your friend. This puts more pressure on players to utilize the entire screen in their playing style (rather than hanging out at the bottom/back of the play field which is typical in many other shooters), making the smart use of hard braking, Nitros, etc. key.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0<em>Drive to Hell</em> also uses grounded vehicles rather than aerial, so you will have to take water obstacles, walls, etc. into consideration as well as your vehicle choice \u2014 trucks and armored cars aren't impeded by liquids (the hovercraft actually gains speed!) but they will have tougher time dodging enemy fire.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Each vehicle has a unique appearance and set of stats determining firing power, special attack duration, health, and size as well as its own personal special attack that works either offensively or defensively. This allows you to choose the perfect one for your play style, whether it's flying around the screen quickly in a fragile indy car or bulldozing through foes with a huge armored car.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0You can listen to the soundtrack or download the Digital Album here on our BandCamp page.You'll have the option to\u00a0immediately download of 8-track album in the high-quality format of your choice (MP3, FLAC, and more), plus unlimited mobile access using the free Bandcamp listening app.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48b212dbd9af54955881bcfe92ef8ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghost Crab Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
