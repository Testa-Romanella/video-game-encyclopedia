As many believed his abilities to be a gift, he felt it to only be a burden as he saw far beyond his own time and long before it but could do nothing to prevent anything from happening. Many of his predictions are now controversially famous for being as accurate as they are without any explanation to how he made them. Nostradamus kept his all his major predictions in a book and kept it locked away in the hopes that they would never come true nor fall in the wrong hands, this book was called the Nostradamacon.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Legends of Time is a multiplayer couch hack and slash where you cooperatively work with friends to take on a world of enemies. As the game progresses you will unlock more characters and weapons to add to your arsenal. When you get tired of playing co-op take to the arena and fight head to head in free for all or team based in a number of different game modes!</p><p><strong>Development</strong><br/>This game has been in and out of production for about a year as we started working on it at the beginning of 2015, due to lack of experience and ability to complete the original concept we decided to put the game on hold until we thought we could deliver what we wanted to do. Since then, it has had time to develop and grow it to a much more solid game that we are excited to bring to all the couch gamers out there!<br/>We plan to release the game onto Steams Early Access so that we can have you' the player assist us in making our game great!</p><p>We ultimately hope to bring the full build of Legends of Time to you via Steam in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94a23cfd036a4622ec956a56d9874cf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 439, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AstroBearGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
