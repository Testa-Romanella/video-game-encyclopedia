Very well thought out and quick to play. I have been looking for a good golf game that has a fun solo mode and this is it!\"<br/>/ Bradley W.<br/><br/>\"What a great bunch of engineering. The stroke is cool. The clubs play true. As does the wind. Only sad part is nobody seems to know it exists. If you play golf in real life you'll enjoy this expressly for the controls and purity of play...\"<br/>/ Drew D.<br/><br/>\"Best golf game out there! It's the only not to be pay to win trash. No micro transaction, just courses to buy. No chests to unblock. Also more realistic, you can choose the clubs and you don't magically know where it will land, and you also don't play a stupid timing game to play. Just feels like golf. Kudos on making this game.\"<br/>/ Tiago S.<br/><br/>\"Lots of fun and as challenging to play as actual golf. I'm enjoying the simplicity and colors of the polygon graphics...\"<br/>/ Richard D.<br/><br/>\"Brilliant game, probably the closest game to a simulation. No pay to win aspects and really bright future for mobile golf games\"<br/>/ Daniel D.<br/><br/><br/>+++ Get in touch +++<br/><br/>Discord: https://discord.gg/3NHxcTdT5B<br/><br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/golfdreamsofficial", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T07:57:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed46099aaa5bd54d533a94d3f9c03423_U53jBaa.jpg", "website": "https://ratherunique.se", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rather Unique"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Rather Unique"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
