The growling voice of The Power sounds astonished by her straightforward, unusual request, and throws her in the depths of The Pit, the infamous underground levels of The Tower. She must now face grave dangers unknown to her kind, with the promise of the greatest reward of all \u2014 pure, unfiltered knowledge.</em><br/><br/>This is a turn-based game!<br/><br/>Use the ARROW KEYS\u00a0or WASD to move to an adjacent tile or attack an enemy on an adjacent tile.
