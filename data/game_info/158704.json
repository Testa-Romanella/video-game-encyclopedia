The statues represent my physical presence at those key moments, signifiers that allow me to access those memories in vivid detail.</p>\n<p>The easiest part of this project was the core mechanic of throwing projectiles based on a controllable force variable. The hardest part that\u00a0I ended up scrapping was creating a predictive arc for that projectile. The second hardest part was conveying the realism of the statue poses; positioning the individual fingers and the natural curves of the body was much more than just modeling and rigging a proportional human body. This was also one of the more enjoyable tasks. It was cathartic to organize and construct visceral moments of my life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1f6abe8350543a3d7c7eb035f8882f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChitLaamTam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
