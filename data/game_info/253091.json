This is great for seeing your positioning and what holes were there.<br/><br/><strong>Customize your settings.</strong> You can adjust where the shooter is and if they should move. Both normal and righty modes are supported.<br/><br/>With TendyTrainer, you'll never be limited by ice time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f82832bf4dbae351f703cd5e933600d.jpg", "website": "http://www.tendytrainer.ca/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TendyTrainer", "Owen Smallwood", "Duncan Boyes"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Owen Smallwood", "Duncan Boyes"], "esrb_rating": null}
