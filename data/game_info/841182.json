Coco is able to shoot platforms to jump on while Effie switches her own gravity to run on the ceiling. Furthermore, finding Co-Efficiency Orbs allow the two to switch places with each other in order to complete their goal\u2014meet each other with all 3 stars. <br/></p>\n<p>Players will play through 3 themed worlds\u2014not including the tutorial\u2014for a total of 23 levels.   Levels consist of tricky jumps, proper chronology, and careful placement in order to complete each with all three stars: one for the minimum amount of platforms shot, one for the minimum amount of gravity inversions, and finally the third for collecting the star in the level. </p>\n<p>This project was made over a single semester by the following as part of a school project. However, we are all very proud of our game and how it turned out!
