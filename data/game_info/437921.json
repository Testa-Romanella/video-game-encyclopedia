You can move as many times as your reflection did, but beware! If you do <strong>not mirror your reflection's position</strong> by the end of this phase, your <strong>achieved points for that round will be halved</strong>!</p>\n<p>Lastly, both your and your reflection's round score (the points achieved that round) will be added to the total score and the dance begins anew.<br/><br/>NOTE: This prototype is quite luck-dependent and not fair, but I hope you can see some potential in it :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c486bff6efd321ae561c888d1e395c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thecreator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
