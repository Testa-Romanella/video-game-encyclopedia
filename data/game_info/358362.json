Every night, they see visions of a great city overrun with maddeningly unknowable machines and technology. This nightmare has been slowly eating away at their sanity, to the point where it's become a crisis. Now you, Dr. Muntz,\u00a0have begun suffering from this nightmare. You have seen your patients slowly be driven insane by it, and you aren't about to give up easy. You're going to grab a gun, find the source of this damn nightmare, and put a bullet in its head.\u00a0Because guns solve all of our problems!</p>\n<p>This game was created using GB Studio, meaning it can be played on the Nintendo Game Boy (assuming you have the hardware, which I don't)!
