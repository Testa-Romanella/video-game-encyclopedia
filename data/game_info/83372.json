In this fun action-physics game you need to guide your rocket around to each waypoint, then land it again to complete the level.  Keep an eye on your fuel supply as you zoom around the objectives to become the best rocket pilot on earth!<br/><br/>This game is part of Game The News; a project to turn news and current events into games.  This particular game took 5 days to create and was inspired by the news that commercial space company, SpaceX's Grasshopper rocket had successfully taken-off and landed, a major milestone in the commercial space race.
