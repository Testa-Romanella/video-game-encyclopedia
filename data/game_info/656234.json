Deploy your minions to eliminate the nuisance!</p>\n<p>This game is my first ever game jam submission that actually feels somewhat complete! The jam in question:\u00a0Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2 - itch.io</p>\n<p>This game makes use of Unity's new Machine Learning Agents toolkit to fly the hero ship around, while the player's job is to destroy the hero ship quickly and efficiently.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow To Play<p>In its present form, the game is just about obtaining a high score and beating this boss. In a later form, there would be consequences and the hero AI would attack the player's mothership while it is not preoccupied, and there would certainly be story elements introduced.</p><p>The hero operates using a trained machine learning algorithm, and as such has mostly unpredictable behaviour. It will try not to touch any of the minions where it can, and will also attempt to dodge the projectiles where it can. Your job is simply to deploy minions to do as much damage as possible to the hero in the shortest amount of time.</p>Controls\r\n<p>If you need to, the help menu is under the blue icon in the top right corner of the game window. Otherwise, here is the help text quoted down below:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\"You</strong>, my lord, are the grand and exalted head of your great intergalactic empire!</p>\n<p>An annoying hero is determined to catch up to our great vessel, and we must not let that happen!\u00a0</p>\n<p>To deploy our ships:</p>\n<p>1. Choose a ship (<strong>Click</strong> the ship icon, or press <strong>Q/W/E/R</strong>)</p>\n<p>2. Deploy the ship from its bay! (<strong>Click </strong>the bay number, or press <strong>1,2,3,4</strong>)</p>\n<p>If our troops make it through, they will plunder the world and earn you extra $$!\"</p>Minions<p>To unlock more minions with your hard-earned money, you can open the \"Evil shop of evil\" and purchase new ships when you have the funds!</p><p>Minion Types:</p><ul><li>Kamikaze:\u00a0The kamikaze ship is expendable and will fly itself towards the hero's ship. The ship will crash into the hero all for the sake of our cause! If the hero dodges the ship, we allow the pilot to land and pay us some membership fees on a regular basis.</li><li>Shooter:\u00a0The shooter will fly straight ahead with deadly purpose! They aren't the most steady of pilots, but\u00a0if the shooter gets the hero in their sights, the shooter will fire until it has no more ammunition to burn! If the shooter escapes, it will go on to plunder - I mean TAX your citizens for more money every second.</li><li>Turret:\u00a0\u00a0The turret is placed on the ground, so our hero won't collide with it, but it will turn and shoot at the hero rapidly! It just needs to reload between bursts.</li><li>Bomber:\u00a0Slow and massive, but they have a lot more durability and will make a lot more money if they make it through to the other side! The bomber drops bombs that float in mid-air as some kind of \"air\"-mine.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Almost Everything:\u00a0Bitshaper, aka:\u00a0me!</p>\r\n3rd Party Credits\r\nTextures\r\n<ul><li>Explosion PNG - https://pngimg.com/image/15359</li><li>Explosion PNG - https://pngimg.com/image/15358</li><li>Explosion PNG - https://pngimg.com/image/15357</li></ul>\r\nSounds\r\n<p>Sourced from https://freesound.org/</p>\n<ul><li>Ringing bell - happy.wav domrodrig</li><li>propulsion jet engine mycompasstv</li><li>Lazer shot -2 colorsCrimsonTears</li></ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>YouTube Free Music Audio Library</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeMusicAudioLibraryNow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108f81987a35510dd45b8a618846dc3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitshaper"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
