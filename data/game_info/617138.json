BUT the octopus has three eyes, and you can poke them to press keys. The octopus is kindly willing to readjust its position in order to change which key is activated when its eyes are poked.</p>\n<p>Solve the puzzles to back up your files before it\u00a0gets ink all over your hard drive.</p>\n<p>This fits the theme of \"Joined Together\" because the player only has three buttons and needs to bind multiple controls to the same button to solve the puzzles.</p>\n<p>We used a custom C++ engine for this game that we made from scratch!</p>\n<p>All assets and code are original.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 How to Play \u2014</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can bind each eye to any control(s). Right click an eye, then click a control on the left to bind them together. Then, click the eye to execute that control.</p>\n<p>If you die, press the restart button at the bottom right to try again.</p>\n<p>If you bind more than one control to an eye, they will be executed in the order you bound them. This is important for level 2 onward!</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2014 Known Issues \u2014</strong></p>\n<p>The controls for dashing have a small hitbox, you have to click where it says \"dash\" rather than the square itself!</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><em>Created by 2FoamBoards and TheSunCat for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam.
