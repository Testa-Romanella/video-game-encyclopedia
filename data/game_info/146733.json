But I was pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Frontier</strong> is a slow-paced tank game in which you progress in a sidescrolling manner. Your goal as a tank commander is to advance a certain amount of meters and clear out everything in your way.\u00a0 The catch is: the more bullets you have in stock, whe weaker they are. If you do yor job right, everybody can get home for christmas. Just don't lose to many men on the way.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy it, please rate at https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/fast-frontier<br/></p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>- Explosion Animation does not want to play anymore.
