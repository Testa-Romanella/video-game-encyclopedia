{"id": 827394, "slug": "beautiful-reflections", "name": "Beautiful Reflections", "name_original": "Beautiful Reflections", "description": "<p>Beautiful Reflections is a first-person, musical puzzle experience about following your senses. Players are guided by their ears through a sparse, uninhabited island, tasked with finding simple alignment of melody, harmony and rhythm and timbre through experimentation and exploration.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game about listening and reflecting upon your surroundings - and, ultimately, taking your time. This is a short game that should take no more than 1-3 hours to fully experience, depending on the player\u2019s ability to resolve musical/sonic puzzles. It is designed to be completable by players of all abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is not designed to be an intense experience, and while it may have a dynamic aesthetic at points, it does not contain any time-critical puzzles or action sequences.</p>\n<p>This game is visually minimalist and should perform well on a wide range of systems without issue. Best played with a good pair of headphones and a comfortable controller.</p>\n<p>Created by:<br/></p>\n<p>Sam Jones - Concept, Audio, Code, Puzzle Design</p>\n<p>Jani-Petteri Sevon - Art, Level Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1ebd5b957ee75554e959f905709448c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Jones"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
