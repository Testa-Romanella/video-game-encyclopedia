This particular mechanic is very interesting, since it allows to see how a robust wooden door that blocks the path on the present, is rotten in the future and presents no obstacle.</p>\n<p>I tried to convert this mechanic into 2D, but since the change of perspective didn't allow the player to use a timepiece in front of the screen, I decided to create an arrow that, upon impact, it allows the player to peek into the other timeline without the enemies noticing.</p>\n<p>This lets you sneak passed guards and syncing your movement so you go unnoticed.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I had many ideas for puzzles, but unfortunately, creating a stable system took most of the time. There are just 3 levels, which aren't really that much of a challenge. However, I'm looking forward hearing your opinion! I had a blast designing this little tech demo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67ffe8ca794a7f1772967dfcc2a49824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Catsoft Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
