THINK. ACT. (and since it's a very political game, VOTE accordingly.\u00a0 Not in the game jam, but in real life. That's much more important in my opinion.) <br/></p>\n<p>I learned a lot from this project. I know that some coding issues remain (lots of unnecessary dependencies, but I only had two and a half days to finish for the jam, so there was no other way) and that I should really get around to recording my piano with a proper PC connection\u00a0and not a camera on a chair next to me.\u00a0 Anyway, I had a lot of fun and I hope you will have fun too playing my game. I also forgot to mention that the car sprites and the road sprites are also not my work but were downloaded from opengameart.org. <br/></p>\n<p>As always I am grateful for any helpful feedback you could give me.</p>\n<p>The game is best played with a 1920x1080 resolution (my monitor). Unfortunately, I didn't have time to test it with other resolutions, so I apologize for any inconveniences that might result from this.</p>\n<p>I emphasized the theatrical input a lot. I hope that works in a game environment.</p>\n<p>Have fun and contact me for discussions about environmental protection, literature or gaming if you want to!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/364/3642d8e8604cdfc4193b49ddf2eeb465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
