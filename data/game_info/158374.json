Get good and get paid! No, really!\r\n<p>With over 10,000 unique levels and 4 bosses governing each one with their own set of weapons, every new attempt will be a new experience.\u00a0<br/>RSV2 was made for instant drop-in-and-play action; there's nothing between you and the core experience. It's a distilled and efficient platforming playground with infinitely increasing difficult, multiple playable characters, boss battles, powerups, and probably lots and lots (and lots) of dying.</p>\n<p>But if you manage to get great at it, you can win real money! Check out the developer page for the details: www.autonomic.int.com<br/></p>\n<p>Doc DuBrane is gearing up once again to save Nucleusport.
