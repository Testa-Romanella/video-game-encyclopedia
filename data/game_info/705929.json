After all,\u00a0 there wasn't a manual when you found it in a dungeon. Now, the guardian demons protecting the cannon have been summoned, and you must defeat them all.\u00a0Experiment and build different spells to see what works (and what doesn't).</p>\n<p>Combine different spell groups, and release the spell to create a variety of effects. Progressing through each level will increase the length of the spell you can create, unlocking more spells for you to discover, starting from a spell length of 3.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move: Left Click</li><li>Spell Parts:<ul><li>Group 1: W, A, S, D</li><li>Group 2: 3, 4, 5, E, R, T</li><li>Group 3: F, G, X, C, V</li><li>Group 4: Caps, Shift, Z,\u00a0Ctrl, Alt</li><li>Group 5: `, 1, 2, 3, Tab, Q</li></ul></li><li>Release spell: Spacebar</li><li>Pause:\u00a0 Esc</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Current Spells (If you don't want to experiment):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Small AOE: 111</li><li>Ranged Scatter Shot: 3333</li><li>Self-Destruct: 4343</li><li>Small Heal: 54515\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Creating a spell that doesn't exist will still have some effect, but will also hurt you.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fantasy Monster(Wizard) DEMO<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/fantasy-monster-wi...</li></ul></li><li>Dungeon Ground Texture<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/floors/dungeon-groun...</li></ul></li><li>Rocks FREE Pack<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/rocks-free-pack-98219</li></ul></li><li>MOBA Game Barbarian mage<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/moba-game-...</li></ul></li><li>Current Key Down Code, by User DeloitteCam<ul><li>https://forum.unity.com/threads/find-out-which-key-was-pressed.385250/</li></ul></li><li>Enemy Facing Targets</li><li>Third Person Camera</li><li>Enemy Projectiles</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7efb7f436fd46e0945f1b5992483e8e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["big-jungus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
