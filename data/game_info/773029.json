The theme was pollution, and I made a stargazing simulator about light pollution ^^ Explore a campground and night and try to find the darkest spot, so you can see the most stars in the sky.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - WASD + Mouse</p>\n<p>Interact - E</p>\n<p>Stargaze - R</p>\n<p>Pause - Esc</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>I know it's annoying to have to download stuff, and I really tried to make this for WebGL, but there were tons of issues, it was performing way worse, and overall in the end I just decided to only make an exe build - I hope you'll still take the time to download it and give it a go! This is my first ever 3D\u00a0game, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, so yeah I'd appreciate it if you gave it a go uwu</p>\n\n<p>I had some more ideas that I didn't have time to implement during the jam, but I'll try to get an updated FINAL version online as soon as possible :D stay tuned and thanks for playing &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28fa2534281a191266b466b77f8a9d58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrTheKunzer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
