It is written in Zig and obviously highly inspired by the great Factorio and shapez.io. </p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to complete levels by producing the required items. Everything will start with a Miner which extracts Items that are transported on Belts to a Hub. On their way items may be transformed using machines.</p>\r\nInput\r\n<p>You will need both keyboard and mouse to play the game.</p>\n<strong>Placement</strong>\r\nLeft Mouse Button + Drag\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Destroying</strong>\r\nRight Mouse Button<br/><em>Note: You can hold to destroy multiple buildings of the same type.</em>\n<strong>Movement</strong>\r\nArrow Keys<br/><em>or</em><br/>Middle Mouse Button + Drag\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Inventory</strong>\n<strong>Open:</strong> Hold\u00a0Z<br/>\n<strong>Switch Building:</strong>\r\nLeft Arrow\r\n/\r\nRight Arrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItems\r\n<p>Items consist of four parts coming from one of the base items or being empty. The base items ring, square, and plus can be found on the map, ready to be extracted by miners.</p>\r\nBuildings\r\nBelt\r\n<p>Place <strong>belts</strong> by left-click dragging from the start to the destination position. You may move while placing to get belts that are longer.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Belts are homogeneous, meaning all items on a belt have to be of the same type.</em></p>\r\nMiner\r\n<p><strong>Miners</strong> excavate base items from the ground.</p>\n<p>They can only be <strong>placed on item patches</strong> on the map. Like belts you need to left-click drag them into the desired output direction</p>\r\nCutter\r\n<p><strong>Cutters</strong> split items horizontally into a left and right half.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Depending on the direction they are facing, <strong>the left half will not always be on the left</strong> and vice versa from the cameras point of view.</em></p>\n<p>Place them by left-click dragging into the output direction.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: Cutters jam if you don't take both outputs!</em></p>\r\nMerger\r\n<p><strong>Mergers</strong> are the opposite of cutters. They take a <em>valid left</em> and <em>valid right half</em> putting them back together into one output item.</p>\n<p>A <em>valid half</em> is a non-empty half where the other side is empty.</p>\n<p>Placing mergers works just like with cutters.</p>\r\nRotator\r\n<p><strong>Rotators</strong> rotate items clockwise. </p>\n<p>You can place them just like belts in a row of up to three to get all the possible rotations.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: Rotators may be filled and thereby jam connected buildings.</em></p>\r\nHub\r\n<p>The <strong>Hub</strong> is the central building where you can see the current challenge and also complete it by routing the required item into the hub.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Hubs are the only buildings without orientation.</em><br/><em>Note: There can be multiple hubs. </em></p>\r\n\r\nLevels\r\n<p>There are 11 levels in the game to teach you all the mechanics. After that you will get random challenges where you have to produce a certain item at a certain rate (2/s - 10/s).</p>\r\n\r\nRoadmap after Game Jam\r\n<p>There are several really important quality of life features I would like to implement in the future</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI: Lamps on buildings indicating activity/being jammed</li>\n<li>UI: Show input and output positions when hovering over buildings</li>\n<li>Tunnels are actually the last building missing in the inventory</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T04:51:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b665ef9cc3f61af3d7d6d629580a95d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["quic5"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
