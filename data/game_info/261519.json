Your mission: to help ordinary citizens prevail against evil. You'll probably screw it up... Yep, you screwed it up. Oh well, it's the thought that counts.<br/><br/>People like to joke about how some loser actually make things worse, but for loser, anything worth doing is worth doing in a way that makes everyone around him completely miserable. Each small level has a loser-type problem, such as a bank robbery, and it's your job to figure out what to tap, and in what order, to, hhhh, save the day... sort of. Though on the (very) easy side, loser's cheeky sense of humor and deliberately absurd style makes us hope we see a bigger adventure in the future.<br/><br/>Are you ready? We\u2019ll see it!. Good luck and have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd7cb28b1afd5c478188e9a14c7e0a5_mazHeZL.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Longwei Yang"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Longwei Yang"], "esrb_rating": null}
