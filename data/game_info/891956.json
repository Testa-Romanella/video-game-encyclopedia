The game is played online, so players can compete against friends or strangers from around the world. Each player is given a character to control, and the goal is to move around the game area and collect marshmallows. As the game progresses, the area becomes more crowded and it becomes harder to collect marshmallows. The game can be played with up to four players, making it a great party game.
