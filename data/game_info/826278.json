I never found the time to write books and by not having any artistic drawing talens what so ever it seemed hopeless. But in Spring 2022 I rediscovered the medium of visual novels and after some technical research I found the proper tools for me to create the necessary art for expressing my ideas.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently I'm doing this in my spare time between my rl job and other obligations of life, but I wouldn't mind if some day I'd be able to reduce my job hours to pour more time into this project, as this is a dream waiting to be realized for a long time.\r\n</p>\n<p>Feel free to contact me any time. I try to be available on a regular basis but depending on rl job projects it's possible that I'm out of the country and off grid from time to time. But I try to plan ahead for those and in case there's a longer planned absence I'll post that ahead of time.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The plan</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Currently I'm releasing a prologue chapter for the first book. It's a proof of concept to see if it works as I'd like to have it and to see how the general reception is.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>After that I'm planning to release the game chapter wise. But I won't even try to make any promises on a timeline yet. I've still a lot to learn working with 3D tools.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Also there will be at least 2 versions, maybe later a 3rd.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>1st -\u00a0 the main story purely from the perspective of the main protagonist.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0you will only see and learn what he sees and influence his path ahead\r\n</p>\n<p>2nd - basically the same story but in addition with many more scenes for the other\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0characters, expanding on the story and putting things into context.\r\n</p>\n<p>3rd - well maybe a spicier version ;)\r\n</p>\n<p>As of now the idea is to release version 1 and 2 for free. Maybe later the 3rd or an extended for low budget on steam.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want to support the project feel free to visit my patreon of buymecoffe page ;) Or check out the soon comming merch. I already sell some posters and large scale prints at some local conventions but I'll put up some online soon as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>Well I guess I've taken enough of your time already.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot and if you like what I'm doing spread the word ;)\r\n</p>\n<p>And constructive feedback is always welcome. But please, just keep it civilized :)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Support Links</strong><br/>https://www.patreon.com/forgottenlectures<br/>https://www.buymeacoffee.com/forgottenl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3a/d3a289ce9420b7acb134474e8791c387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Forgotten Lectures"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
