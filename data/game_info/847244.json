What are they doing there? Why don't they run away? We will have to meet them in person to understand (<em>if anyone dares to enter that unexplored territory</em>).<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Also</strong> </p>\n<p>Any fanart, critique, bug report, correction or contribution is more  than welcome.  It could be part of future content featured in new  updates!<br/>This is my second attempt to make a VN, quite similar to my first work in concept, with a totally different aproach. The story is way simplier and \"jam-friendly.\" So I hope you enjoy it!<br/>I'm still struggling writting in english and programming, but this is just the beggining!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong> </p>\n<p>Produced, directed, written and programmed by: <em>SWKsoft</em><br/>Sprites by: <em>SWKsoft</em><br/>Script Correction by:\u00a0 Kopadot<br/>Game Engine: <em>Renpy</em><br/>Other Software used: <em>Aseprite,\u00a0 Audacity</em><br/>Backgrounds taken from: <em>Pexels, Pixabay</em><br/>Cool webpages used: <em>Google Docs, Google Sheets</em><em>, Convertio</em><br/>Music by: <em>TAM Music Factory</em><em>, Presence of Music</em><br/>Sound taken from: <em>TAM Music Factory</em><em>, Freesound</em><br/>Font:<em> Squarewave (by jeti)</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong> (cool people)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My frens :) | Lemma Soft Forums | r/RenPy | Renpy Tom | Tom Fulp | Daniel Heiman | Dwayne Douglas Johnson (The Rock) | Ryukishi07 | ZUN | Johann Sebastian Bach | Kikiyama | Toby Fox | Jonathan Banks | Hyogo Onimushi | David Capello | Tim Follin Kotoyama |\r\nZeil Learnings\u00a0 | RenPyXavi | Elitist LLama\u00a0 | Nobou Uematsu\u00a0 | CDLP\r\n| TADA\r\n| Dan Salvato\r\n| Yoshimune Kouki | Linus Tech Tips | Vinesauce Joel\r\n| VimislikArt\r\n<br/>\u2026 And you! <br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T13:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2a833bb193815e935ec47d012e42402.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SWKsoft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
