You'll have to manage your crew carefully to get out of this dangerous situation and maybe find love in the process.</p>\n<p>Loosely inspired in the Star Trek tv-series, the story has elements of romance and adventure and 3 characters: the male captain, a female human ensign and a female robot lieutenant. In some endings there's a chance of a NSFW narrative scene (you can configure if you want to see that content). The game also has 3 levels of difficulty: depending on the one you choose, you'll have more or less days to fix your ship and escape, and access to some hints about the ship's systems.</p>\r\nThe Characters\r\n\n<p>You. A young capitan fulfilling his dream of going to the final frontier. The fascination and love for space runs in his family for generations. He has a strong sense of duty and leadership abilities. But maybe he has some difficult decisions to make. How will that affect him?</p>\n\n<p>Alice, a determined young ensign, funny and strong-willed. She is passionate about space and... just about everything. Really.\u00a0Somewhat rebellious and impulsive, she nevertheless devotes herself to her duties.</p>\n\n<p>M.A.R.I.A., a female robot, devoted to help and protect human beings, who is struggling to find her own purpose in life and certain feelings too human for her programming.<br/></p>\r\nMaking-of\r\n<p>The main purpose of making this game was to test, demonstrate and promote the capabilities of a collaborative system implemented in the Spanish Renpy Community in Discord, where you can sell and buy services with a virtual currency. The main background, the sprites, most of the music and the writing of a scene, have been commissioned with this system.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Writing: Mario Matalla and Ertal</li><li>Sprites: Ladifishy</li><li>Background: Decadenttia</li><li>Music: Ceb and Mario Matalla</li><li>Coding and Design: Mario Matalla</li><li>Betatesters: Selzis, Decadenttia</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b87fa1f5e287244809af448a02ac75f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matalla Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
