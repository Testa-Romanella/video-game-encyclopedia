Nearly a decade later, I released Corporate Fury: Capitalist Corruption Edition for Windows. It's completely free, as opposed to the usual free-to-play bullshit we see these days. I like to think of it as my personal hate letter to the corrupt form of global capitalism that helps enslave most of us, so please enjoy it in your spare time as you continue to throw most of your waking life away in service to a grotesque hierarchy of wealth!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a labor of love, and is packed full of secrets and references, with a main loop that primarily involves fighting one-on-one matches to earn credits and claw your way up the corporate ladder. There are plenty of rough edges, this free Windows release is largely unsupported (thanks to job, health, and family distractions), and getting it working nicely with your input device of choice may require a bit of config file editing. See the included ReadMe.txt for details there.</p>\n<p>You can get a look at the game in motion (showcasing some of the new Windows port features) here:\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can also find more info on Corporate Fury and my many other games/projects on my personal web site and Twitter:</p>\n<p>http://www.richwhitehouse.com/<br/>http://www.twitter.com/DickWhitehouse</p>\n<p>Note that the screenshots provided here are from the iOS version.\u00a0The\u00a0Windows version is the same thing, but at higher resolution and without the touch overlay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c69440b6bde3a07b46d2076c725f660b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rich Whitehouse"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
