All in all, I am happy with the result, but ashamed of the process.<br/><br/>It feels weird that this pile of code and assets held together with spit and prayers is actually my first \"released title\".<br/>Be advised; I am currently working on a lot cooler and less buggy games aimed to be released on both IOS, Android and PC, so if you like this project, feel free to follow my socials: VonRiddarn.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bb535910832181e09120f4154d3f43a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VonRiddarn"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
