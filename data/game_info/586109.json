Get to the top of the high mountain to become the ultimate rabbit. There are 3 levels, each with a unique twist with the carrots and food bags being hidden in random locations to make it just that little bit harder. You can also play with your friend split screen and race to 'The End' to see who can be come the King Rabbit and be first to the crown. In the first level you need to find 5 carrots to get past the gate into the farm, once in the farm you need to find 10 food bags, 3 of them need a key. After the farm you will need to avoid the dog and find fuel for the car. Once the fuel has been found drive the car to the base of the mountain and start the climb to become King Rabbit.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Key features</h3></strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Random spawn locations for hidden objects.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Split screen for 2 player.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>New challenges for each level.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T03:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a34fe33fcde634af7ee1c1dfeb2c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fraser.T"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Coding Cat"], "esrb_rating": null}
