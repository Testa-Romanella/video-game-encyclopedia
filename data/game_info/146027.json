Culture Glitch is the game we made in 48 hours during this Game Jam, where I was one of two developers.</p>\n<p> The idea of the game was to critic museums, and the (mostly \r\nintentional) lack of information linked to the expositions to fits to \r\narguments and political positions. We thought about a game showing this \r\nabsurdity of not learning, where we have more fun than learning at the \r\nmuseum. In this game, you learn more elements in the story by going in \r\n\"Glitches\" (here, the subject is the Woman\u2019s position in roman society \r\nwith a comparison with our society).</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game is in French only.\u00a0 You play it like a classical top-down platformer.</p>\n<p>As it was done for a french jam, the controls are adapted for AZERTY keyboards :</p>\n<p>- Z,Q,S,D or Arrow keys to move the character</p>\n<p>- E to interact<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed2eb69ffd01062914e6b77e8dff3422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["benoitbm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
