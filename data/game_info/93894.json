There is so much about Mass Effect that lends itself perfectly to the classic point and click genre, and we felt that trying to bring in some of the old LucasArts humour while poking fun at some of the tropes of the modern RPG was something that really helped blend the two together in a fun way that made our little fan-fiction \"demake\" the perfect homage to both. We hope you enjoy playing through this passion project as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p><p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p><ul><li>Over 1 hour of classic point and click gameplay</li><li>Animated intro</li><li>Built in hint system</li><li>Multiple animated endings</li><li>Paragon or Renegade choices!</li></ul><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Game Design, Creation, Art &amp; Animation - Lee Swain</p><p>Additional Design, Art &amp; Animation - Brett Pelaez</p><p>Written by - Lee Swain</p><p>Additional Art - Dan Liles</p><p><strong>VOICE ACTING (in order of importance)</strong></p><p>Brett Pelaez as Commander Shepard</p><p>Lauren Fernandes as Liara</p><p>Blake Swain as The Catalyst</p><p>Lee Swain as Reaper</p><p><strong>OTHER CREDITS</strong></p><p>\"Commander Shepard\" Title music</p><p>Miracle of Sound (Gavin Dunne)</p><p>MASS EFFECT \u00a9 2003-2017 EA International (Studio and Publishing) Ltd.
