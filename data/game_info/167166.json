You must commence in battle with a closet-dwelling monster and defeat it to save your daughter's life.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was a student project that I had 2 months to work on. This was my initial foray into game design and coding, as well. It was a huge, stressful learning experience.</p>\n<p>I am aware of some bugs that remain within the game, if I wasn't on a deadline the game wouldn't be up quite yet. I will, however, be releasing patches as often as possible. I'm actually hoping to get a day one patch uploaded.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, or would like to give me either positive or negative feedback, contact me at b.turcotte1993@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>It has arrived! I just released the first patch for Kindred Spirit. This patch addresses some issues with physics and collision, lag on player death, overlapping tutorial ui, and some minor tweaks elsewhere. I was bedridden with a terrible flu earlier this week, sorry it took so long to put this patch out.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/1482fecb59c355ec6ccac216a30089d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KimJongTheIllest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
