Forget all about having different options and weapons to choose from. Get ready to have your options already given to you and you have to choose the right one or you die. Once you pass the text adventure, get ready for something totally unexpected. Continue in the game by clicking the right answer with the mouse and the controls for the second part are pretty self explanatory. \u00a0Have fun and critism is greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee5b117fa0dd9c121b1c5fb1943543fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Boss Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
