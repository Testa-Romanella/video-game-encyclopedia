{"id": 795848, "slug": "snek-gba", "name": "Snek GBA", "name_original": "Snek GBA", "description": "<p>This is a Game Boy Advance\u00a0game I made back in 2018. It is written entirely in assembly language.</p>\n<p>It is\u00a0a very simple game in which\u00a0you guide Snek (the snake) on her quest to eat all of the eggs that keep mysteriously appearing, until she completely fills up the screen... or she bonks onto herself (or a wall).</p>\n<p>Please note that, unlike in many Snake games, Snek grows four segments rather\u00a0than one after eating an egg. Also, since this has been asked many times, egg colors mean nothing, it is just a bit of visual flavor.</p>\n<p>The game has different speed difficulties, including a TAS (Tool-assisted Speedrun) speed for anybody who feels up to creating an input replay file or some sort of AI that plays the game, I guess.</p>\n<p>The controls are very simple, you can use the D-Pad to select a speed setting and then press Start to get the game going. Once in-game, the D-Pad can be used to steer Snek, whilst the Start button can pause and resume the action.</p>\n<p>Beat the game and Snek will be awarded with the coveted egg medal, unlocking a new titlescreen for you to enjoy! You can press Select, once unlocked, to switch between the two versions of the titlescreen.</p>\n<p>A GBA emulator\u00a0or a way to run the game on original hardware is needed to play this game.</p>\n<p>The source code for this game, as well as the full credits list,\u00a0are available over on the game's GitHub page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T08:36:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3cf0fdd618fac99f86c1aa82c707a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leonarth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
