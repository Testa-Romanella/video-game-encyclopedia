I submitted this at the last possible second (OOPS) and didn't get a chance to bug test a lot... or balance the battles...\u00a0</p>\n<p>MAJOR BUG: Okay, so there's a puzzle with a scale and gems later on. There's a bug in the game that causes the scale to not return your gems. SO you HAVE to get it right the first time or it may hard lock your process. To bypass the puzzle, insert\u00a0EXACTLY 2 green gems, 3 red gems, and 3 blue gems into the scale. Don't hit RETURN ALL GEMS or you might be screwed and will need to reload. Sorry...</p>\n<p>MAJOR BUG: You won't be able to finish the game completely\u00a0because the branches block your way at the end. *shrugs* It's just one simple cutscene, you essentially completed the game at that point (possibly over 1 hour of play).</p>\n<p>1. In the \"chicken cave\" the spot where you teleport in is further in than intended. If you wish to return the previous room, you'll need to press the \"interact\" button on the second from bottom tile.</p>\n<p>2. The save points, the red pluses on the ground, don't animate. This makes them less\u00a0visible, but they work. If you open the menu, you can save anytime.</p>\n<p>3. The skill \"eavesdrop\" is unlocked from the start of the game when it was supposed unlocked later on. It doesn't work with any enemies within the cave, but it does work with the enemies you encounter once you leave the caverns.</p>\n<p>4. In some cutscenes, the player can walk around during pauses in the dialogue.</p>\n<p>5. Some NPCs change sprites based on what direction you interact with them.</p>\n<p>6. For the scale/gem puzzle, there are glittering gems you need to collect. Unfortunately, they don't animate and are hard to see.</p>\n<p>7. There's a shadow who just won't seem to go away when I told him to... jerk...</p>\n<p>(Note: I'm going to release a patch after the contest has ended. It'll clean up all the little hiccups and bugs that the game has.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/7199348a33af0dc74dfb78377d634736.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CommodoreGroovy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
