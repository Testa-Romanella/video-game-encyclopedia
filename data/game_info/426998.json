This game was made in 72 hours for the Score Space Jam #8. Feel free to leave your high-scores in the comments below! Just to note I am aware that initially the game pacing is very slow, and I wish I could go back and change that. Also, if you are on a device without a 16:9 aspect ratio\u00a0(like most Macs), press the grayed-out fullscreen button to enter fullscreen. Otherwise hit the blue one.</p>\n\n<p>Highest Score Known - 5272 by me</p>\n<p>DM me: BenBonk#8753 on discord if you have a higher score and I will update it!</p>\n\n<p>Programming and Art - BenBonk</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/BenBonk<br/></p>\n\n<p>Music - GizmoDude8128<br/></p>\n<p>Links:\u00a0https://smarturl.it/gizmodude8128</p>\n<p>Discord: GizmoDude8128#1528</p>\n<p>SFX -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style<br/></p>\n\n<p>Font - https://www.dafont.com/pixeled.font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/275e1e0dfdc3118086152e220c7086b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenBonk", "GizmoDude8128"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
