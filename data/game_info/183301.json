The control scheme is like something not used in games before it. Hard to control, even harder to master.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently with two game modes and a third on the way Drifty Tanks will forever be expanding, the two current game modes are the classic death match, and the short but sweet knock out.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Death match:\u00a0</strong>The objective of this game mode is pretty straightforward. Pick a map, and shoot your enemy until he's dead, first person to win 3 rounds is declared the winner. You'll see how thats easier said than done when you begin to draft in crazy ways while dodging bullets that your opponent somehow managed to aim in a somewhat accurate direction at you. Then you'll try to run in fear as you realized he reached a power up before you did, but it's too late and they annihilate you.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Knockout:</strong> Knockouts premises is simple, knock your enemy into the lava without getting knocked into the lava your self. This whole ideology goes away when the best control you \u00a0can manage over your tank is a circle, it's okay though because when you look at your enemy you see that he's doing wonky donuts in his tank as well.<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Planned Game Modes:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0<strong>Soccer:\u00a0</strong>Does running into a soccer ball with a tank you can't control really need an explanation? (The answer is yes but the game mode is in beta so we're gonna hold off on that for now)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -<strong> Single Player Deathmatch:\u00a0</strong>We currently have a semi-functioning AI that will shoot, dodge, and dash for those of you without someone to play with</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -<strong> Online Deathmatch:\u00a0</strong>Have you ever tried to make an online game? Do you know how difficult that is? We're working on it, it'll be done soon hopefully.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong>The controls for this game are simple.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Pink Tank: WASD to move, Space to shoot</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Blue Tank: Arrow Keys to move, right shift to shoot</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Our message to you:\u00a0</em></strong>Wow.
