You have to place colourful plants on small grey islands, gradually returning the colour to them. Place the plants and you collect points that can be used to place even more plants, while also repopulating the islands with cute alpacas.<br/>The game doesn't rush you, allowing you to take your time, review the results of your work and think calmly about your next move.<br/><br/><br/>As you score points, you get coins with which you can unlock new plant species that give you more points. This lets you fill up your islands with more variety!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T06:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c8fc3ec04e307156966e5f2231aafd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LostVolBytes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LostVolBytes"], "esrb_rating": null}
