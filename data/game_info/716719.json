{"id": 716719, "slug": "e-thon", "name": "E-THON", "name_original": "E-THON", "description": "<p>A spacecraft simulation prototype that implements a fully interactable holographic cockpit, quadtree-based planetary terrain generation, atmospheric rendering, and much more.\r\nSet in an infinite procedurally generated galaxy, the prototype allows you to jump between systems and travel at a high speed within a solar system. Up to any number of planets may generate in one system, and different star classes will give off different lighting at different intensities.</p>\n<p>The ship's systems include a Logarithmic Radar, which plots the location of every celestial body in the solar system, a system map with the ability to target a planet or star, a polarizing filter to allow for on-the-fly changes to how much light should make it through the cockpit window, a flight assist system that changes the flight model of the spacecraft from a simplified, point-and-fly system to a more complex but flexible one, and a hyperdrive and supercruise system combo that allows for jumps within the solar system and between solar systems.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>T</strong>:\u00a0<em>Turn the ship ON/OFF.</em> This cannot be done while in hyperspace or supercruise.</p>\n<p><strong>Right-Click:\u00a0</strong><em>Toggle Control Mode.\u00a0</em>Switches between a cursor to click on interactable cockpit items to a joystick to control the spacecraft.</p>\n<p><strong>W/S:</strong> <em>Change ship's throttle.</em> With Flight\u00a0Assist, this changes the target speed within the range of -1.5km/s and 1.5km/s. Without Flight Assist, this acts as pure acceleration.</p>\n<p><strong>A/D:</strong> <em>Strafe.\u00a0</em>With Flight\u00a0Assist, this accelerates the ship sideways until it reaches a safe limit and keeps its momentum relative to the direction the ship is facing even as you rotate it around. Without Flight Assist, this acts as pure acceleration.</p>\n<p><strong>R/F: </strong><em>Elevate.</em>\u00a0With Flight\u00a0Assist, this accelerates the ship vertically until it reaches a safe limit and keeps its momentum relative to the direction the ship is facing even as you rotate it around. Without Flight Assist, this acts as pure acceleration.</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse:\u00a0</strong><em>Rotate.\u00a0</em>With Flight Assist, the rotation gizmo indicates the speed of rotation. Centring the cursor will return the ship's angular momentum to zero. Without Flight Assist, beginning to turn adds a torque that needs to be counter-acted to stop the spin.</p>\n<p><strong>N:</strong>\u00a0<em>Enter System Map.\u00a0</em>Switches the radar from Logarithmic Map mode to System Map mode. In System Map mode, you can use the mouse to select a celestial body within the list and <strong>left-click</strong> to target it. This will give you information about its distance and show a direction line on the radar in Log Map mode. <strong>Right-clicking</strong> while in System Map mode returns you to Log Map mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Z</strong><strong>:</strong>\u00a0<em>Toggle Flight Assist.</em> This can also be done by clicking the FLIGHT ASSIST toggle in the cockpit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d6738b43a9777534d9bfeb39f1c1d4d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Francesco"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
