Go around and collect ores. Sell ores at the Space Station or use them to upgrade your ship. When you run out of asteroids to mine or just if you're looking for some new stuff, head to a warp point to travel to the next asteroid field. Be careful though, space has no brakes and there are dangers you can only find out there.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Menu Music:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/<br/>Warning Sound:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/878-Martian-Scanner.html<br/>Ship Damage Sound:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/336-Pin-Or-Ting-Metal-Plate.html<br/>Tractor Beam Sound:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1744-Shooting-Star.html<br/>Thrust Sound(Quiet):\u00a0https://soundbible.com/1492-Rocket-Thrusters.html<br/>Planet Texture Generator:\u00a0http://www.texturesforplanets.com/</p>\n<p>If I missed a credit tell me and I'll update it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T05:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bd41779e58c8299cf4fc4bb6145276f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gallone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
