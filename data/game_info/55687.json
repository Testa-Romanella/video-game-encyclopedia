A follow-up to 1986's Out Run, it was released as a dedicated game, as well as an upgrade kit for the original Out Run board.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, Turbo OutRun has players driving a Ferrari, this time a Ferrari F40. Players now traverse a set route across the entire continental United States from New York City to Los Angeles instead of the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a time limit, Turbo OutRun also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a Porsche 959. The \"Turbo\" in the title also plays a factor as players can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed. Various power-ups which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be chosen at various stages of the game.</p>\n<p>Ports of Turbo OutRun were released for personal computers, as well as Sega's own Mega Drive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T09:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b761b3065ee29e5ac1d4b3bb318d6091.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 7, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC", "Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
