You must operate four buttons to defend your ship from the oncoming hordes of enemies that await you. Each Button corresponds to a gun on the side of your ship, you must use these guns to destroy enemy's that you will be able to see on the screen in front of you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n            The only movement you have is being able to look around your ship, but you are not able to walk around it. The goal of the game is to survive for ten days until the company you work for is able to send help. Every day the enemies evolve and have a new ability - speed, higher spawn rates, etc. I hope you wish to try out Oceans of Emptiness and I bid you farewell.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T04:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a68/a68dd4634c5a3f61dff569d667992aad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chimera Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Chimera Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
