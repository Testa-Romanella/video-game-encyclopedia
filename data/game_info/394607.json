Too many wrong orders and you're out of business.</p>\n<p>Use Left, Right, A, or D to rotate the platform to redirect the fruit. Be careful, the platform resets every time a fruit is redirected ;D</p>\n<p>Esc to pause</p>\n<p>Customers who have waited too long will take away from your score. But a WRONG order will count against you.<br/><br/>The idea was to have a person batting the fruit into the smoothies for a storyline,\u00a0 but both artists I joined up with never participated in the project. So I, the programmer, got stuck with last minute art work to do. I'm not an artist, as you can tell. haha</p>\n<p>If anyone would like to update the art in this game, shoot me message! I'll more than likely take you up on the offer!<br/><br/>I want to complete this game to it's full design.<br/><br/>HAVE FUN!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5f7bf142f623e3e58d3bb216db6eee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kaideu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
