However, his prison is as tricky as the shifting sands of the desert... and there is the matter of his missing legs.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Should you be defeated, you will awaken on the same level, but it may no longer look familiar.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Rise Ankehotep, reclaim your canopic jars from the sons of Horus and crawl your way out of the pits of eternity!</em></p>\n<p>This game was made in a week for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2021 and the goal was to create an old-school, first person, grid-based, turn-based dungeon exploration game.</p>\n<p>Ankehotep's Prison is a maze that moves in three dimension, and every time you play, a new labyrinth will be generated. There is no game saving because there was not enough time to implement it, but if you die, you restart in the same level -- though it will look different!<br/></p>\n<p>The game can be played with the keyboard or a gamepad, which works really nice!<br/></p>\n<p>As\u00a0Ankehotep, you can not just move around the dungeon but you can crawl on the walls and ceiling and drop on unsuspecting enemies.<br/></p>\r\nControls<p><strong>PLEASE\u00a0NOTE:</strong>\u00a0The\u00a0tutorial\u00a0erroneously\u00a0says\u00a0that\u00a0rotation\u00a0is\u00a0Q\u00a0and\u00a0R,\u00a0it's\u00a0Q\u00a0and\u00a0E!\u00a0I'll\u00a0update the\u00a0game\u00a0after\u00a0the jam\u00a0judging\u00a0period.</p>\r\n\u00a0KeyboardGamepadMove and Strafe<br/>WASDLeft Stick<br/>Rotate left and right<br/>Q and E<br/>Right Stick<br/>Action<br/>SpaceAPlace Ankh<br/>ShiftXWaitTLeft Bumper<br/>ClimbLRight Bumper<br/>Let go and reorient to ground<br/>EnterY\r\nBugs\r\n<p>Since the game was done in a week there are still a few bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes, skeletons will walk on your square.
