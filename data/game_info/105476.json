I'm using this to showcase several design features that come with creating isometric perspectives in third-person scenarios. Hopefully this will be a nice small reference that you can use to discover what works and what doesn't work inside 3D spaces in all video games.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nWhat features does it have?\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following features are currently implemented:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Character controls\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>This just utilises the standard third-person character controller.</li>\n<li>Able to use keyboard or controller.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A simple environment to play around in\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Has a slope and a few platforms to jump across.</li>\n<li>I will put more scenarios in soon.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Teleporting when falling off the stage\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>This will be replaced by preventing the player from going off the map later.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nWhat will it eventually have?\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following will be implemented:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More scenarios</li>\n<li>Configurable camera angles</li>\n<li>A better mid-air control system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nWhat will you do with this?\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis is not going to be a full game (at least not as the moment). All the code is hosted on \r\n\tthis Github repository. You can freely use the code I write, and copy any examples I use for reference in your own games.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tPlease give feedback about what sections you think are good and bad. It'll be useful for people to play-test this and see what scenarios are better to the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI don't really know itch.io too well, so I hope there's a good way for you all to contact me about this. As a last effort, you can email me at \r\n\tbiendeos@gmail.com. I'll figure out a way to display this stuff. You can also help by writing issues on the Github repository.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c0561536f2ee6a16ae4d83b6949d758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Biendeo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
