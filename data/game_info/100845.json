{"id": 100845, "slug": "memo-cart", "name": "MEMO CART", "name_original": "MEMO CART", "description": "<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT: for many people using Windows, game won't work on Chrome, please try on Firefox or IE.</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is a \"path memory\" game. You drive a mine cart than make LEFT or RIGHT decisions over a series of intersections in a mysterious abandoned mine. One of the path is correct, one is incorrect. When you take the wrong turn, you fail and the game start over from the highest point reached. \u00a0The goal is to remember which is the right path to progress more and more intersections. (You can't observe which is the right turn at first, only way is to try it). You start at level 1 where there is only one intersection. When you reach the end, the cart will start <strong>over the same map</strong> but from an higher point. You will have to remember all path taken previous and it gets more and more complicated!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>LEFT arrow, RIGHT arrow (or Swipe on mobile): changing the direction</li><li>SPACE (or Tap&amp;Hold on mobile): brake. this is only useful if your cart goes very fast and you don't want it to go too crazy to see things</li></ul>\n<em>Important: Unfortunately my WebGL shader is a bit intensive to <strong>compile</strong> and might freeze forever on some machines (even tho it's performant enough to run).\u00a0Try LOW quality if this happen (it disables the normal lighting). if you are on Windows, it is preferable to use IE than Chrome. For some reason, Chrome on Windows appear to have issues compiling the shader. There are some issues on Android, I\u00a0have not tested a lot on iPhone but should work in LOW mode.</em>\n\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li><strong>16 unique biomes</strong> (some common, some rare)</li><li><strong>256 mines to explore</strong> (in Random Game mode) from 00 to FF (hexa)</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>Daily Challenge</strong> running a new map each day, unique per day.
