Windows 10 and all Microsoft products belong to Microsoft. This game is merely satire!)</p>\n<p>(Originally Created in 2015)</p><p>Explore Microsoft head offices in this cutting-edge, virtual environment experience! Narrated, directed, guided, designed, contrived, and schemed up by Microsoft Sam (Recasted Voice Actor).\r\n</p>\n<p>But remember, not everything is as it seems...\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was one of my first ever Unity games back in 2015. It's clearly unfinished and has no main menu, no loading screen, not even a watermark saying it is my game. However, I thought what it is, has some sense of humor in it, and wanted to share it with people. I do not own any of Microsoft's IP, nor do I own the songs Pink Fluffy Unicorn Dancing on Rainbows, or Darude Sandstorm. If there is an issue with the usage of anyone's IP in this game, I will take it down without hesitation. Again, this is a fan game purely made for satire and learning experiences. (I was 13 at the time of making it).\r\n</p>\n<p>Check out my previous games, and trailers on my website, GameJolt, social media, or Youtube!\r\n</p>\n<p>***\r\n</p>\n<p>*Join the GoB Discord server for special events!*\r\n</p>\n<p>GoB Official Discord Link: https://discord.gg/R6fERkE\r\n</p>\n<p>***\r\n</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates, videos, and games from Sayincraft Studios!\r\n</p>\n<p>Social Media and Stuff:\r\n</p>\n<p>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/sayincraft\r\n</p>\n<p>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sayincraft/#\r\n</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sayincraft\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.sayincraft.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>***\r\n</p>\n<p>Everybody needs a little CONSOLATION!\r\n</p>\n<p>#horror\u00a0#adventure\u00a0#pointnclick\u00a0#other\u00a0#fangame\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T11:05:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fa/6fa0fefff51bd0bc1fd7fde1daf904d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sayincraft Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
