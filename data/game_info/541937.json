A computer from the 80s. Very popular you know. Well I wanted to make a game back on the old C64 in the 80s, but, I couldn't get my head around the old assembly language, not clever enough you see. But now thanks to the wonderful programs at your disposal today. The real clever people, have made it easy, for the not so clever me, to finally make a game, of some sorts anyway.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the C64 and to arcade shooters like phoenix, galaxians, galaga, space invaders, that sort of thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry if you don't know of these games, I'm just so old.</p>\n<p>It's a full release, but still needs a little work doing, I'm getting there slowly. Please be patient and bare with me, I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>PC Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys - left and right</li><li>Z - Shoot</li><li>X - Shield</li><li>Esc - Quit Game</li><li>Alt+Enter - Toggle fullscreen</li></ul>\n<p>Controller and Gamepads supported.</p>\n<p>Having difficulty getting xbox controllers working at the moment, sorry for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T05:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db4/db410231fa0dc3e5ad39fade1fcceb56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Late teur t' gem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
