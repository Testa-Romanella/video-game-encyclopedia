So be nice! It is a bit buggy and has work to be done, but please enjoy!</p><p>EDIT: Once you are able to start choosing where you want to go, please DO NOT GO BACK TO THE BEDROOM. There is a bug where the exit door doesn't work. It should not be necessary to go back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T02:52:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f0256d847c9a80d462ced7566a03f2a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skett"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
