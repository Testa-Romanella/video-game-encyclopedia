By using an ability, you grant it an additional point.</p>\n<p>For example, the red ability starts out in its egg form, and to \"evolve\" it, or rotate it out, it will take exactly one point for it to rotate. Evolving the ability will give it a new ability, and when it reaches the butterfly form, it has its strongest ability and will de-evolve back into its egg form. The evolution path goes like this: Egg --&gt; Larva --&gt; Butterfly --&gt; Egg and repeats.</p>\n<p>To play the game, use QWE to use an ability. <strong>Red = Q | Blue = W | Green = E </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Press Escape to adjust the volume of the song.<br/></p>\n<p>Here are all of the abilities in a neat little table:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<br/><strong>Red</strong><strong>Blue</strong><strong>Green</strong><strong>Egg</strong><br/>Deals <strong>5 Damage</strong><br/>Inflicts a <strong>bleed debuff </strong>that <strong>ignores armor</strong> for <strong>2 turns</strong> dealing <strong>2 damage</strong><br/><strong>Increases</strong> your <strong>armor</strong> by <strong>2</strong><br/><strong>Larva</strong>\u00a0 Deals <strong>2 Damage</strong><br/><br/>Inflicts a <strong>bleed debuff </strong>that <strong>ignores armor</strong> for <strong>1 damage for 2 turns</strong><br/>Spews acid on the enemy <strong>reducing their armor</strong> by<strong> 2 for 2 turns</strong><br/><strong>Increases </strong>your <strong>armor </strong>and<strong> current health </strong>by<strong> 2</strong><br/><strong>Butterfly </strong><br/><strong>Reduces Enemy Armor </strong><br/>by<strong> 2</strong><br/>\u00a0<br/>Deals <strong>2 Damage</strong><br/>Heals you for <strong>4 Health </strong>on your <strong>next turn </strong>and heals <strong>2 for the next</strong><br/>Increases your armor by <strong>2</strong> &amp;<br/><br/>Heals you for <strong>2 Health </strong>on your <strong>next turn</strong> and <strong>1 health for the next</strong><br/>\n<p>Wondering what armor does?
