I recently created a 2D game on Unity that I'd love for you to try out. It's a <strong>space shooter</strong> game with a unique twist \u2013 everything is hand-drawn and looks like <strong>doodles</strong> on a notebook. It's a fun and quirky take on the classic space shooter genre that I think you'll enjoy.\r\n</p>\n<p>I put a lot of time and effort into designing every aspect of the game. I'm really proud of how it turned out, and I think you'll appreciate the attention to detail that went into making it.\r\n</p>\n<p>I'd really appreciate your <strong>feedback</strong> on the game. I'm always looking for ways to improve and make it even more fun and engaging for players. So if you have a chance to play it, please let me know what you think!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:45:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e05f5a67d7727a80366e19f6c0b92f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EREN ERDO\u011eAN"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
