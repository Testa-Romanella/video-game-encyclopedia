{"id": 47813, "slug": "slice-hd", "name": "Slice HD", "name_original": "Slice HD", "description": "Slice HD is a sinister puzzle game for your Android device. The goal of the game is to clear layers of very sharp blades to push the red button. Push all the buttons in order and you win. While trying to open the puzzle you must not touch the sharp edges of the blades or you will get SLICED. When this happens, blood spills from your finger(s) onto the glass and the puzzle will reset. The blades only move in specific patterns that you must intuit by touch. Often, you must use multiple fingers to hold blades open while you manipulate other blades with other fingers. This game is really about trying to figure out the hidden behaviours of the blades and moving the blades out of the way, carefully.<br/><br/>Great party game and a GREAT tablet game!  Supports Google Play Services with leader boards and achievements.<br/><br/>First 12 levels are free.<br/>The additional level packs are purchasable.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-24T07:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a8924445e0abc070d20bd9a4b8556a7.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Slice-the-Game/111319215611777", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["twitchgames", "SmallBall"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["edward Annunziata"], "esrb_rating": null}
