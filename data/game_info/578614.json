You can upgrade your towers in the Magical-science shop in the mainmenu (permanent upgrades) and within a game you have 2 possibilities to \u00a0upgrade your defenders. <br/>The defenders are magical creatures based on an unicorn-setting. <br/><br/>The game has a story-modus with 10 Levels and an endless mode with 4 level. It comes with a playable tutorial or you're just looking at the \"help\"-sheets. The tutorial is just based on the standard-tower-defense-things.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T05:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e97d49381e8d450b50462c12786c4680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsaVII"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
