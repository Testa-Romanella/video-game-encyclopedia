I find it frustrating when I keep getting stuck on a particular part *cough* 98% Super Level 1 *cough* but I can't stop playing it! Great rhythm game :) Aug 24, 2013 by XG4mer360 - United Kingdom<br/><br/>Audio Ninja is a highly addictive rhythm title that puts you in control of Ninjipu, a young ninja who is having trouble finding his own path. But when he is given an awesome pair of headphones by Bill Merchanto, a mysterious man from the future, he gains the power to defeat his enemies by following the rhythm! <br/><br/>Experience intense action by defeating hordes of clones created by Clone Evil, while your brain cells dance to the beat of outstanding soundtracks! <br/><br/>Have you noticed how, when you listen to music, you unconsciously follow the rhythm by moving your head, or even tapping your fingers on the table? <br/>This game takes advantage of the latter, allowing you to defeat Ninjipu\u2019s enemies while feeling the beat. You will be immersed in a cartoon-like environment with simple, yet beautiful, character design, along with funny and innovative animations, all driven by a very cool musical experience. <br/><br/><br/>Features: <br/>\u2022 4 Worlds with different environments and cool soundtracks. <br/>\u2022 62 Levels. <br/>\u2022 12 Super Levels. <br/>\u2022 Survival mode based on 3 world themes. <br/>\u2022 Alter time with faster, slower and even reversed gameplay! <br/>\u2022 Crush your enemies by using a tractor... among other power-ups brought by Bill from the future! (Which would be our present. Time travel is tricky that way.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T10:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed91639e0d7faf388065c79955b4e7bc.jpg", "website": "http://brainz.co/co-productions/audioninja/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["BRAINZ SAS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["BRAINZ SAS"], "esrb_rating": null}
