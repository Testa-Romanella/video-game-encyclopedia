This lets you to smash around the enemies, knocking them off. Also you can knock around the crates, to solve some of the puzzle this game provides</li><li>ESC for menu</li><li>Press space in boss cutscene to skip them</li></ul>\r\nDeveloper's ramblings\r\n\r\nIf you click on this, you will be taken to the bundle's page!\r\n<p>This game was made for the Care Package Budle, with the main theme of: Positivity.<br/>And with the fact that I'm not so good at storywritting &amp; my previous daydreaming experience of beating the cr*ap out of my anxiety &amp; stress and feeling better afterwards, I thought I'd fiddle around with this and make something simple that you can just zen out and enjoy to get your stress blasted off.</p>\n<p>In the end, I have made an action game where you... beat the cr*ap out of the negativities, as you can see. It's not exactly 200% fitting to the theme, but I do hope that they can get their stress off like I did!<br/></p>\n<p>This is my 1st time doing a commercial project. And because of that, I was very concerned when I first began this project... But fast forward to now, the project has ended already... Time flies, isn't it?<br/></p>\n<p>Also, I tried my best to test and hunt down the bugs... But if you happen to find a gamebreaking glitches or issues that went under my radar, then please let me know!<br/></p>\r\nExtra thanks\r\n<p>Much Kudos to the Care Package Bundle squad for making this bundle happen: JUSTCAMH, Kultisti, GubbyBee, Stopsignal, Thaniel, Sonicboomcolt, ClockMaker and Juanba; It was very fun working with those cool folks.<br/></p>\n<p>A lotta thanks to Tero Lindeman/kometbomb, for creating Klystrack (which were used to make the musics and sounds for now only this project, but also other projects too)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/31399dcc7d511aec6376579377844c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zik"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
