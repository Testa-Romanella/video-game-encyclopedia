Use the different strengths and weaknesses of your enemies to stay alive as long as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tControls:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WASD </strong>- Move<br/>\n<strong>Left Mouse </strong>- Attack<br/>\n<strong>Holding down Right Mouse</strong> - Activate Shift Mode<br/>\n<strong>Release Right Mouse</strong> - Shift into the new body\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdditional Shell Shift Gameplay Help:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tDestroy boxes and collect health packs or shift into enemies to gain back health.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are 3 different types of enemies. The Pyro, the Blade and the Sniper. Choose wisely. For example the Pyro is very effective against Blades.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tCorpses will decay after some time.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFrom Wave 9 on you will also encounter Elite versions of the characters. They deal more damage and have more health. You can also shift into their bodies and use their advanced strength for some time.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWave 10+ is a pretty solid performance for a new player.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>From Wave 14 on it will get tough with more and more enemies and randomization.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shell Shift is a prototype and was made as a student project</em><em> at the Cologne Game Lab. There is no further development planned. There might be some bugs or balancing problems.</em></p>\n<p>\r\n\tEnjoy anyway!</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCredits<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJonathan Mannshoven \r\n\t@Retrific - Programmer, Designer and Art Director <br/>\r\n\tTristan Hantschel \r\n\t@TristanArkham - Game Designer and Project Manager<br/>\r\n\tFabian Donner \r\n\t@Thunder_Draws - Artist, Character Design and Trailer<br/>\r\n\tCyrano Kaul @cythemusicguy - Artist &amp; Sound and Music Designer<br/>\r\n\tKurt Rexrodt - Artist, Environment Design and Background Artist</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d447993b68edb0a95d77fcf3da42cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retrific", "TristanArkham", "ThunderDraws"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
