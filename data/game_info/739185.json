I was hooked since then and so it came to my mind to make a fan remake of that great game.</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Except the intro full motion video from the original game, all assets and code has been created by myself. I started development at end of March 2022. Here you can play what i have achieved so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>You can play the first map of the game. Terminals and doors are triggered by walking against them. You do not need to press any use-key.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move = W, S, A, D</li><li>Shoot = Left Mouse</li><li>Grenade = Right Mouse</li><li>Switch Weapons = Mouse Wheel, Q, E</li><li>Jump = Space</li><li>Run = Left Shift</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>I made this game only for entertainment and programming education and it is not intended to be sold anywhere.
