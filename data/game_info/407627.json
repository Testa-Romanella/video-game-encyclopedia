Drag the items to the flowerpot and wait for the plant to grow. Items have to be given in the right order or it wont work.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>P.S: you have to wait about 1 minute for it to fully grow after you put sunlight in it.</p>\n<p>This is the first project that I have fully completed and can say that I am satisfied with the final project. I am not good at drawing so sorry for the lack of flowers on the plant. It is the first time I have used particle systems and audio sources in unity so its not perfect but hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/696292363252ea6bd506b37df2548638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Jayla_House"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
