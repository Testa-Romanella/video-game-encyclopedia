Energy supplies will come to our rescue which will allow us to withstand as many assaults as possible. The player wins when he destroys 100 meteorites and loses when he finishes the life indicator reaches 0. To shoot the lasers, just close the left hand, instead with the right we will aim at the meteorites.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c54/c54cfa4a8730f852c90d784a6b724275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Refref1990"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
