I have a dumb sense of humor that can seen throughout the stories, so I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions or comments about it, feel free to email me at projectcyoa@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Anyways, what is this? Life is a start to something, beginning as a seed, and becoming much larger than that, whether it be a spud golem, or a Christmas tree. I wanted to make a disconnected story that is still interesting to go throughout and find new secrets within them, which in some way makes them interconnected.\u00a0 I'm going to stop myself here, or else I might end up spoiling how the whole story works. Anyways, I'll stop myself here and give a shameful plug to my youtube development channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCARpjBkg__vuXMixb1L-JTg?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T05:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/175d58670a75502c7387ffbc2071f213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Project CYOA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
