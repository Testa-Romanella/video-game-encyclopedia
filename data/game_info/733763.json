It took about 2 years to make, and was entirely made using Gdevelop 5. I am also a small one man game dev, so it's not the best game out there. However, it is a lot better than a lot of other small games that I see.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a7bd46175c8f273c3158e83faba6d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stefano_Gaming"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
