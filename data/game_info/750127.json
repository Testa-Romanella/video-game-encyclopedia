The player must help the Striders regain control of the universe and save the world from an indolent life controlled by the Spuds. It is played by stepping on the dance pad, and the running mechanic consists of the player repeatedly stepping back and forth on the side arrows. The player must run fast enough to stay within the moving game level.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0the game is intended to be played with\u00a0<strong><em>dance pads</em></strong>\u00a0but\u00a0it is possible to play the game with a keyboard.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Made by:\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Ivar Nordvik Myrstad\u00a0<br/>Turid Cecilie Dahl</p>\n<p>Extra:\r\n<br/>\r\nOle Halvor Dahl - Music\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard to dance pad mapping:<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de366e2c1fa1bf55f5e515279e9d421a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ivarnm", "Turid Dahl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
