However, it has not been easy. I would have to get better at creating game art, learn how to design 2D levels, and learn how to create my own custom soundtrack and sound effects. I might also make a devlog on my progress creating the larger projects. To be completely honest, things have not been so easy in my personal life, and I have been taking game development tutorials on Udemy, which is why I had hardly created any ideas\u00a0for games these days. I am hoping I could release a larger project at the end or this year or if not, next year.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T09:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67fddd6ba33406420b4f8023f48678fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KRFGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
