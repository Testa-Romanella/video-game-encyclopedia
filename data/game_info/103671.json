Rom can be played in an Atari 2600 Emulator, such as Stella, or on Real Atari 2600 and 7800 systems if you have the means to put it on a cartridge. This game is free, as will all of my future Atari 2600 games, but a small donation is appreciated and helps me to create more Atari 2600 games.\u00a0</p><p>Description:<br/>Eat people to avoid starvation, but watch out for that pesky Coast Guard!</p><p>This game is still being developed. Updates will resume upon a certain amount of plays.</p><p> Controls and gameplay:<br/> In Hunger Shark you play as a shark with an insatiable appetite. <br/>- To move Hunger Shark, point the joystick in the direction you want him to move.<br/>- To eat people, Hunger Shark must sufficiently overlap them. Doing so gains you points, and replenishes a bit of your Hunger Bar.<br/>- If your Hunger Bar drains completely, you will die of starvation.</p><p>- After some time, when the water becomes blood red, the Coast Guard will send a patrol ship and shoot at you. </p><p>- Touching a squid collects it for later use. Using a squid, by pressing fire, will replenish your health completely, but will spray ink, thus turning Hunger Shark and the water black for a time. You can carry up to three squids at a time, but touching them will always yield 1000 bonus points.<br/>- Treasure is known to pop at the sea floor from time to time. It may not be nutritious, but it does yield 1000 bonus points.<br/>- Mines will periodically spawn near the bottom of the screen, so be on your guard!</p><p>- The game increases in difficulty slightly with each level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/720bae41d4d75977d21594ebaf16cd9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuckyCassette"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
