Drop mines with Z and X.  Wait until the viruses get close and detonate the mines with the same button.  Destroy multiple viruses to get score combos.  Z is the left paddle, X is the right.  Move back and forth with LEFT and RIGHT.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe viruses increase in number and speed after each wave, and you also recover some health.  Each new wave generates a new hexagram, and its explanation scrolls in the yellow area below the health structure.  These explanations are the result of your consultation with the oracle <em>I Ching</em> or <em>Book of Changes</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>\n<em>LEFT / RIGHT</em>: Move paddles<br/>\n<em>Z / X</em>: Drop and detonate mines<br/>\n<em>F11</em>: Fullscreen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/3491875d09fa93092313583db998c82a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ohsqueezy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
