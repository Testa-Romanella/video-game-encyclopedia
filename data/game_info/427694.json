The wine has hit the spot, but alas, the nap did not take its toll.<br/><br/>\tAfter some time one of the strong men pulled out a coin shaped cut of a branch, which had been prepared in advance, and loudly declared in a drunken bass: \u201cMy King, what are your orders?!\u201d The scene then was followed by a booming laugh.<br/>\tWhen the laughter had subsided, one of the participants took a second wooden coin and nibbled it as if it was made of gold. <br/>\t\u201cMy coins of the undead are stronger than yours!  My forces will bite into them, and they won\u2019t even get to the battle\u201d \u2013  he completed in a thoughtful tone.<br/>\t\u201cThen I will play as demons!\u201d \u2013  picked up the third. All three looked at each other laughing again.<br/>\t\u201cLet us play, let\u2019s battle, yes let\u2019s play\u201d \u2013  echoed laughter through the trees.<br/><br/>\tIt would have ended like this, just a joke, but the next day, without any arrangements, all three of them would bring along a couple of dozens of uneven round coin shaped tokens made from a chopped branch.<br/><br/>\tThey all set down around a stump and looked at each other, as if saying \u201cso, how are we even going to play this?\u201d. And then the Lord of Acorns, holding one of his tokens high, declared that his cavalry was advancing on the Undead. With these words, he slammed the token on the stump with such force that it let out a creak. <br/>        \u201cNow it is your turn of the \u201cUndead\u201d, or yours of the \u201cDemon\u201d, decide for yourself, I\u2019m not afraid of any of you...\u201d - declared the first player in a royal tone of utter importance, lifting his head up to emphasize his noble origin.<br/><br/>\tA month later, all the lumberjack brigades were already playing the wooden tokens. A little later, the fame of a peasants\u2019 small fun game reached the local guild master. There was only one problem \u2013 the status did not allow the upper classes to mess with the chopped branches. But defeating the hideous werewolves and demons using the Golden Templars is of course another matter entirely. Thus the first Post Scriptum CTG coins were cast.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T07:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd7b32c119c519b04a61d3de7cbe4887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alien Intelligence UAB"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alien Intelligence UAB"], "esrb_rating": null}
