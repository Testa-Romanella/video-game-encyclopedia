Use your arrows keys to move, space-bar to fire.  Rebels will fire on citizens unless no citizens exist, in which case they'll fire on you.  Knock down buildings with your ship, take out the Target building type and earn bonus cash.  As cash accumulates on each planets your ship will be upgraded to a more powerful weapon.  </p><p>Drop ships will deliver tanks and new soldiers, and a suppressive air force will be deployed on planets eventually.  Some planets will be completely occupied by rebels.  And, somewhere out there, waits the hive mother, weaving a web of resistance against your obvious superiority.  Kill 'em all.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fd77d404b175c96c5d01dc3d3a7ccd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bstuart"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
