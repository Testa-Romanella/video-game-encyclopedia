It can be completed in under 15 minutes but there is no need to hurry, take as much as you want.</p>\n\n<strong>FAQ:</strong>\n<p><strong>How do I play in fullscreen?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can press F1. Although fullscreen might look a bit blurry.</p>\n<p><strong>Which version should I play?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You should try the normal one. Borderless is for a bit more immersion.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Besides inputing your name at the start, the whole game can be played only with the mouse.</p>\n<p><strong>Linux? MacOS?</strong></p>\n<p>A: It should work on linux if you use something like Bottles/Crossover etc. MacOS? Yeah, ain't happening. Sorry.</p>\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Music by\u00a0White Bat Audio.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d86e91776033daa6cf814f97f19ddb84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Painite\u30c4"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
