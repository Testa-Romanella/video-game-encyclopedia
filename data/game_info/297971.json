{"id": 297971, "slug": "bitraid", "name": "Bitraid", "name_original": "Bitraid", "description": "<p>Bitraid is a top-down zombie survival game, made with Gamemaker Studio 2. Bitraid has you surviving through a maximum of 50 waves, to get money and try to compete on the leaderboard.<br/>The game has over 100 custom weapon skins, that you can buy/sell and unlock from crates. Currently the game only has 6 characters, but more are already planned to be added for the next update.<br/><br/>The game took me two months to make on my own, and is the second full game I have ever made. It's a huge improvement from my last attempt, with way less bugs, and way more content. <br/>You can help me improve the game, by downloading the game, playing it for a while, and pressing F12 in the game to open up a form with questions to answer. The answers I get to these questions will help me balance the game, fix bugs and add new features.<br/><br/>I would like to give a massive thank you to my community, for supporting the project. I hope you enjoy the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/060bdf5d22ce30d25cb12b987fa34e45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colorics"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
