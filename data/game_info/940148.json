You earn 10 points per block destroyed, and if you clear all the blocks,<br/>the field resets and the game continues.</p>\n<p>Control your paddle using the \"f\" key to move it left and the \"j\" key for right. Any other key will stop the paddle.</p>\n\n<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:<br/>====================<br/>Source code is in BOUNCE.DO.
