It's time to take matters \r\ninto your own hands!  Battle your way through hordes of enemies. Learn \r\nand use powerful magic spells.  Infiltrate the fortress to pass through \r\nthe gateway to the dark underworld.  Can you defeat the demon lord, \r\nKilgazar, and free the land from his grasp?\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKilgazar is a turn-based strategy roguelike that pits you against hordes\r\n of enemies. Designed to play like a board game, it features a \r\nstreamlined interface that makes the game deceptively simple to play \r\nwhile presenting a challenge to players. Blending strategy, planning, \r\nand a bit of luck, it takes more than sheer aggression to make it to the\r\n end and defeat the demon lord Kilgazar.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose to be a warrior, magician, rogue, or a team.</li>\n<li>Single player and hotseat multiplayer modes.</li>\n<li>Wield deadly weapons!</li>\n<li>Cast powerful magic spells!</li>\n<li>Face challenging enemies!</li>\n<li>Find treasure!</li>\n<li>Never the same game twice!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>System Requirements:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java 6 or newer (the Windows installer already comes with a private copy)</li>\n<li>OpenGL-capable graphics card</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Supported Operating Systems:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Windows Vista, 7, 8</li>\n<li>\r\n\tLinux (has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mac OS X support has been dropped.
