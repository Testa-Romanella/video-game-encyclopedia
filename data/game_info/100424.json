In this episode, a section of the game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4eaedeb30bc23d3e41f473003d89b526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stand Off Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
