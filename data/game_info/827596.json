After mastering the initial concept you then progressively unlock a number of \u00a0additional actions (Mirror, Sort, Etc) to aid in the design of your networks and allows large complex sequences to be altered with ease.</p><p>The levels are organised into a main branch, which will uncover more actions as you progress, and sub-branches which contain optional additional levels where you can practice techniques used in the level it branches off from.</p><p>There are currently 20 Levels &amp; 4 Actions, however the game is receiving constant updates and more content will be added soon.
