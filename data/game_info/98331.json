Can you make it to the end? If not, you can just build your own level using the built-in level builder. Do you hate the built-in level builder? Well then just open your level up in your favorite .txt editor and type away.</p>\n<p><strong>*** ABOUT ***</strong></p>\n<p>Capybara Capriole is a one-button Run-n-Jump game using exclusively text-based graphics and a 64x64 resolution (8x8 Text Characters). Levels are made up of a single line of text; the built-in level being made up of about 2,400 characters!<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game for #LOWREZJAM 2017, but the game is 100% finished. Some of the code will be recycled into my upcoming game \"Run-N-Jump-N-Jump-N-Run\", which will hopefully come out in September. \"Run-N-Jump-N-Jump-N-Run\" will have both capybaras &amp; horses, scrolling backgrounds, and 2-player versus racing levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>*** CONTROLS ***</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Space Bar is the only button used while playing a level</li><li>Use the cursor keys, Space Bar, and Esc to navigate the menu</li><li>ALT + ENTER toggles Full Screen</li></ul>\n<p><strong>*** LEVEL BUILDING ***</strong></p>\n<p>Level building is very easy to do, but since the game is so small, there is no in-game documentation. Here are the basics...</p>\n<ul><li>You can start creating a level by using the built-in level builder. Just type #'s for ground obstacles, $'s for a finish line and any other character for a sky obstacle. Then hit enter...</li><li>You'll be prompted to choose starting HP and a name for your level. Level names can only have a maximum of 7 characters.</li><li>If you want to edit your file further you can exit the program and open it up in a text editor like notepad (I use Notepad ++ personally). Saved levels also have further level building tips built into them.</li><li>Feel free to share your level in the comments section below!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>*** CREDITS ***</strong></p>\n<p>Everything was created by @MansterSoft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/457/4575eb00db84474e9fd2e37f6150b8ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MansterSoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
