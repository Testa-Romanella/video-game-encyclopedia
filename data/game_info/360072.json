The king has been cursed by the sky god for his narcissism, for he believes he controls the rain and thunder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the kings only kin, you set out for the heavens on your flying carpet\u00a0in an attempt to talk to the sun god, the highest god there is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You can play Above the Clouds with a friend or a family member if you like, I\u00a0find that the game becomes more interesting when you play it with two people.</p>\n<p>I made this for the GMTK Game Jam 2019. I started the game with the idea of making a platformer with a single platform. But after making some of the puzzles, I found them to be way too hard. Hence why I added in other platforms while keeping the focus on the single moving platform that is the flying carpet.</p>\n<p>Sadly I didn't have enough time to express the narrative I conjured, neither was I able to find time to make some nice ambient music for the game. Though the sound me whis- I mean the wind is nice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:29:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c2/5c2ad6cea356fcb2607cc014cbd9435c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saityavuz"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
