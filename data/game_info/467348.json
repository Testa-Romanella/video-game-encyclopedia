I have only been making games for 3 weeks and honestly struggled quite a bit with this one, but I'm really happy to have made something to submit for the GMTK Jam 2020.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Out of Control\", so we decided to make a game in which you don't control the hero character, but instead control the platforms which they use to navigate out of the dungeon. The Dungeon is of course called Control, and the Wizard is attempting to get out of it. <br/></p>\n<p>You control the platforms with different combinations of keys on the keypad, so the idea is that as the dungeon progresses it gets more and more challenging to move all the platforms at once and you lose control in the process.<br/></p>\n<p>Everything was made within the 48 hour limit, which is a fact which I'm delighted by. I'd love to revist this idea when I get a bit more experience making games and maybe add more levels or mechanics.</p>\n<p>The music was something annoying I made quickly in FL studio.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed the game I'd love some feedback!</p>\n<p>If you loved the art, please visit Robert's fantastic itch.io page https://0x72.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:09:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28addeee735cca2de268dccede6f1ca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Regoro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
