Will gatotkaca succeed in stopping Brajamusti?</p>\n\n<p>Brajamusti<br/></p>\n<p>In this game Gatotkaca can jump as high as the sky until it reaches the clouds because Gatotkaca is wearing an Antrakusomo Kotang shirt. Gatotkaca's supernatural powers are the magic of the soul that can penetrate the enemy's soul and destroy it from within.</p>\n\n<p>Brajamusti's Minion<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful with Brajamusti soldiers who block Gatotkaca from going to the Pringgodani kingdom. The soldiers carried large stones and threw them into the air to prevent the gatotkaca from flying.
