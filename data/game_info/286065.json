It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Ten is a very special age in our family. Why? It's a secret. You'll have to wait and find out!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I have a few things I need you to do for me before you get your presents. Do you promise you'll do them, no matter what I say?</em></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Yes, Mama</strong> is my first game! It's a short horror story made in RPG Maker VX Ace over the course of about four days. It\u00a0<strong>takes 5+ minutes to finish\u00a0</strong>and there are <strong>two endings</strong>. I made this game\u00a0mostly to learn how everything works, so the graphics and most of the sounds are the ones provided with RPG Maker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I tried my best to work out any weird bugs I\u00a0could find, but let me know if there are any I missed.</p>\n<p>Note: I <em>do not</em> expect anyone to pay for a game this short! But if you're interested in donating a dollar when you download it, I would love and appreciate you forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36bdae09361de04004d5d6fc6c395d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mirlambda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
