This strange house is the last place he was seen - perhaps there will be clues inside to what befell him? there aren't, I didn't implement them in time. <em>Venture forth and find out!</em></p>\n<p><strong>The goal:</strong> For now, the goal is to discover as many rooms as you can before someone returns to the house. After this happens, get back to the entrance and make your escape. Yes, this is a placeholder objective but without it I'd be <em>reeaally</em> stretching the definition of \"game\"</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nPlanned features implemented:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>generic interaction system where the player can trigger nearby interactable objects they're (vaguely) looking at - used for doors and a few objects I managed to place in time.</li><li>Room tiles that are added to the house when a door is opened;\u00a0link together and rotate to fit. This took most of the time.</li><li>Deck of premade rooms with unique sprites and objects to be drawn from (well kind of. I made the deck, but only a few rooms have unique contents and/or floor sprites)</li></ul>\r\nFeatures planned but not implemented:\r\n<ul><li>Items and inventory system (so close!)</li><li>point and click interactions using said items (see above)</li><li>branching endings (let's be honest that was a silly goal and not achievable in a week unless I made a text adventure)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T13:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8303ad06009e2440bac05c8d014ee163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HexaDexterous"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
