{"id": 61404, "slug": "triptrip", "name": "TripTrip", "name_original": "TripTrip", "description": "TripTrip is an autoscrolling, color-matching action game. Your objective is to navigate The Ball to the end of each level. To do that, you must navigate around and over obstacles while matching The Ball's color to the color of the floor beneath it. Along the way you'll battle bosses, gain new powers, and discover secrets.Color-changing Action!The main obstacle you face is the color of the floor as you roll through each level. You can change among four colors. You have a split second to switch colors as you move between two differently colored tiles.Vertical!The Ball can jump! Not only is the floor dangerous because of colors, it can sometimes be dangerous because it isn't there! The Ball must collect \"J Powerups\" along the way to enable it to jump over gaps in the floor.Bosses!As you make your way through the 20+ levels, you will encounter a boss at the end of each world. The bosses all have their own tricks and abilities - it'll take some skill and cunning to defeat each one.Difficulties!We're not going to sugarcoat it - this game is not easy....unless you set it to Easy Mode! It's a good way to learn how to play the game, but you won't be able to discover certain secrets if you play the whole thing on Easy Mode. Beyond that, if you want to be a super cool guy or you really hate using Continues, Hard Mode is for you!Music!The game features a catchy, authentic retro soundtrack with 16 tracks. You won't be able to stop whistlin' these tunez.Controls!You can use either a keyboard or a controller to play the game. You can also rebind each key/button. WASD and arrow key fans rejoice!Unlockables!There are secrets available for fulfilling certain conditions as you complete the game. That's all we have to say about that here.Note about Color BlindnessIf you experience any form of color blindness, you should carefully consider the trailer and screenshots on this page before purchasing the game. Color matching is a core aspect of the game, and there is no color-blind-friendly mode at this time. We may consider adding one in the future if we get enough requests.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/1073286cfacb3255a844f0b65e507025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["About Airplane"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["About Airplane"], "esrb_rating": null}
