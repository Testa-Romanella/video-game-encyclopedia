Before you is a table and you can choose to visit 3 worlds. The first is a climbing challenge: climb walls, buildings, boats, even clouds! Teleport to the second world: a monster shooter game. Get them before they get you, and climb the mountain to teleport to the third world: a stairway through the sky: can you make it across? From there, go to the endscene, in space.</p>\n<p>Our first game. Let us know what you think! Thanks.</p>\n<p>For PC. Requires: VR and a VIVE. Though it should work with Mixed Reality Headsets.</p>\n<p>Works with OpenVR, not Oculus (at this time). We are experimenting with putting the Oculus headset feature in, check out Kezaria (one scene) at:</p>\n<p>https://accidentalwizardry.itch.io/kezaria-for-oculus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/242/242fda88bb5564f7b07e1f3d0d24b822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Accidental Wizardry Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
