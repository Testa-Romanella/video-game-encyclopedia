Its simple game where you have many unique types of slimes that move around on their own or you can play with them. You\u00a0merge two identical slimes to advance them to the next type, thats how you advance trough the game.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are 11 types total and you can only create the most basic one, so it will take some time to reach the last type.</strong></p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Grab, hold and throw slimes</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Merge two identical slimes by holding them and releasing them as they touch</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Spawn new basic slime when big yellow bar\u00a0is full</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Toggle UI (To hide it so it does not block view - Recommended)</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"S\" Button (in-game)\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Toggle spawning of slimes (So you dont accidentally spawn new ones when you don\u00b4t want it, it can be annoying)</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\"A\" Button (keyboard)\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Spawns all the different slime types all at once (Intended for debug or if you just want to see all the types without the wait)</em>\n</strong></p>\n<strong>Slime Types</strong>\n<p><strong>Just to tease you, here are the names of all the slime types, going in order from the most basic to the last (top to bottom).\u00a0Of course every slime type\u00a0is completely unique in their behaviour and visuals!\u00a0Its just the names though, so you\u00b4ll have to find out what they do yourself!\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Green Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Blue Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Red Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Pink Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Gravity Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Antigravity Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Burst Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Chaos Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Blackend Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>* Comet Slime</em>\n</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>* Star Slime</strong></em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T08:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a40bde323e3e0cb9633be7aca7cf773.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vergon Forge"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
