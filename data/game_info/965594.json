It takes 4-12 hours to complete all levels.<br/>\r\nQ: Are the questions computer-generated?<br/>\r\nA: Yes, but all levels have been manually selected, eliminating questions that rely too heavily on enumeration. Almost every step in each level can be logically deduced.<br/>\r\nQ: Why are there settings like \"being your own offspring and parent\" and \"your parents being your offspring\"?<br/>\r\nA: These settings add new reasoning clues for sex-linked inheritance questions.<br/>\r\nQ: Any suggestions?<br/>\r\nA: Make good use of the annotation button, especially the \"0\" and \"1\" buttons provided in sex-linked inheritance questions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T02:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b04/b0404346636176b42bc4487049dd6a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnesiumteng Machine"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Magnesiumteng Machine"], "esrb_rating": null}
