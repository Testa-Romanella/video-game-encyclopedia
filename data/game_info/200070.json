{"id": 200070, "slug": "biome", "name": "Biome", "name_original": "Biome", "description": "<p>Biome is a turn-based strategy game for two players based on Conway's Game of Life. <br/> <br/>The game is played on a grid with empty spaces (white tiles) and blooming spaces (green tiles). Each player controls a set of geomancers (red/blue circles) that can manipulate the terrain around them. <br/> <br/>If a geomancer is standing on a tile when it blooms, the geomancer goes \"KABLOOM!\" and is removed from the game. You win by eliminating all of your opponent's geomancers. <br/> <br/> <br/><strong>[Controls] </strong><br/></p><ul><li>Click on a geomancer unit to select it. </li></ul><ul><li> Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move a selected unit. Each unit can only move a limited number of spaces per turn. </li></ul><ul><li> After you have moved a unit, click on the highlighted tiles to flip them. Each unit can only flip a limited number of tiles per turn. </li></ul><ul><li> While moving a unit, click outside the grid to end the movement phase early and switch into flipping mode. </li></ul><ul><li> Deselect all units and click outside the grid to end your turn early. </li></ul><p> <br/> <br/><strong>[More Info] </strong><br/></p><ul><li>At the beginning of your turn, all your units will level up. A unit's current level is indicated by the number of dots on it. </li></ul><ul><li> A unit's level determines the number of tiles it can move, and its range of influence. </li></ul><ul><li> A unit can only flip tiles within its range of influence, and it *can't* flip tiles that are inside the range of an enemy unit. </li></ul><ul><li> At the end of each turn, the \"Game of Life\" rules will be applied to the grid X times, where X is equal to the combined levels of all units in the game. See the next section for details. </li></ul><ul><li> Green tiles block movement, and can be used to create walls. </li></ul><ul><li> The tiles with a tiny dot in the middle are spawners. To capture a spawner, it must be within range of one of your units and *not* inside the range of any enemy units. </li></ul><ul><li> At the beginning of each turn, a spawner will generate a new unit for the player that controls it. Spawners will not generate a unit if they are occupied or blooming. </li></ul><p> <br/> <br/><strong>[Game of Life Rules] </strong><br/> <br/>- An empty tile will only bloom if exactly 3 of its neighboring tiles are blooming. <br/> <br/>- A blooming tile will only remain in bloom if 2 or 3 of its neighboring tiles are blooming. <br/> <br/> <strong><br/>[Game of Life Reference] </strong><br/> <br/>http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ <br/> <br/>http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/ <br/> <br/>http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85dd112d7cebd5417b2409c11ec0eea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dreamlogician"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
