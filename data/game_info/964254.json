Complete quests that shape their personalities, impact their wellbeing, and decide the fate of their community. Ensure the survival of your populace in a grim fantasy world inspired by Slavic folklore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Erect palisades, develop structures, and grow your gord from a humble settlement to a formidable fortress. However, expansion won\u2019t be easy! Your population is constantly at risk from enemy tribes, gruesome monsters, and mysterious powers that lurk in the surrounding woods. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The versatile quests in Gord will have you venturing beyond the walls of your settlement, either to prevent calamity from happening or to address a personal matter of one of your subjects. The Scenario\u2019s main objectives will guide your journey, while side quests and random encounters will dispatch you into the wilderness to hunt down legendary creatures, uncover secrets of the Ancients, or vanquish a nasty scourge. Expect the unexpected.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Set the stage by choosing from a wide range of Scenario options, and try to emerge victorious. Take it easy or set an impossible challenge; almost anything can be adjusted! Choose from a variety of primary objectives, select the level size, the intensity of raids, the environment you\u2019ll play in, the types of enemies you\u2019ll face, starting resources, and even the severity of weather. Of course, don\u2019t forget the Horrors.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A healthy populace is the key to survival in Gord. Every aspect of your settlers\u2019 lives - from illness, to hunger, to the death of their kin - can impact each subject\u2019s Sanity levels. Keep a close eye on them, as once a subjects sanity reaches a critical point, they will suffer a breakdown or even flee your rule. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Please the Gods with your prayers and they may give you access to their spellcasting abilities. Incantations vary in nature - some are offensive while others are defensive - but they all help to tip the battlefield in your favor. Conceal areas from your enemies, gain control over threatening beasts, or turn an unholy rage against all who dare to oppose you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Chronicle explains the history of the Gord universe that blends real-world Slavic mythology with dark fantasy. Pages torn from The Chronicle will be scattered throughout the game\u2019s landscapes, giving dedicated players an additional challenge of discovery. Collecting as many pages as possible will provide insight into the origins of the Gods, ancient factions, and the mystical Whisperers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T15:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9adf713558deedd2c2cc2d904e146df0.jpg", "website": "https://gord.game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 4, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 524, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Covenant.dev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
