It takes place in the future where there are robots and cyborgs living alongside people. Robots and cyborgs are not seen as people and are treated differently. This leads to Phaze and Flux to lead a protest to get equal rights. The protest gets shut down, leaving Phaze and Flux with only one option: to go talk to the mayor himself. Phaze and Flux start making their way through the city, solving puzzles, and dodging obstacles that lie in their way.</p>\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CONTROLS\r\n<ul><li>WASD:</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0WASD to move,\u00a0Space to jump,\u00a0Shift to sprint, and\u00a0E to use your ability and to interact.</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys:</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0Arrow keys to move, C to jump, Z to sprint, and X to use your ability and to interact.</p>\n<ul><li>Both:</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Tab to switch characters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - P to pause.</p>\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SOFTWARE\r\n<ul><li>Unity\u00a0</li><li>Plastic\u00a0SCM<br/>\n</li><li>Visual Studio Code</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>Procreate</li><li>FL Studio</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0TEAM\r\n<p><strong>Logan\u00a0</strong>- Artist, Level Designer, Writer</p>\n<p><strong>Drew</strong> - Programmer, Composer, Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T11:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e93e646ae1a84e55d16fadbff61cd1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["drreww", "charre"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
