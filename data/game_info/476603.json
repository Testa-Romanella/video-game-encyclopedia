Features are listed below, there also some other few things that the demo has. In case of any doubt, problems or feedbacks please consider commenting.</p>\n<p>However, I do not have authorship under any of the arts in this project. The arts are free to use for personal projects and some for commercial projects as well. All the owners of the arts are listed here and the link to the specific asset is also in the respective folders (as well as here).<br/>I emphasize, however, if you want to use some art for personal projects that consult the author of the art. As for the code, the project is for study purposes and can serve as a basis for other projects. There is no need for credits but comments are appreciated.<br/>I especially thank the videos of the Game Endeavor channel, which served as a basis for character movement and other things.<br/>The channel can be accessed through the link: https://www.youtube.com/c/GameEndeavor/featured</p>\n<p>Link to the pages where I obtained the visual resources for this project:</p>\n<p>https://sanctumpixel.itch.io/forest-lite-pixel-art-tileset<br/>https://lionheart963.itch.io/wizard<br/>https://pixel-frog.itch.io/pirate-bomb<br/>https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero<br/>https://rvros.itch.io/pixel-art-animated-slime<br/>https://adwitr.itch.io/pixel-health-bar-asset-pack-2<br/>https://startledpixels.itch.io/2d-pixel-item-asset-pack<br/>https://hyohnoo.itch.io/keyboard-controller-keys<br/>https://godoftetris.itch.io/2d-mountain-platformer-tileset<br/>https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-portal-sprites</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Simple Platform game</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0State Machines</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Simple combat with combos\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>jump on walls</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Destructible objects</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Parallax backgrounds</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Level transition</li></ul>\n<ul><li>HUD</li><li>Tilemaps Usage</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Small particles2D example</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Hazards</li><li>Two different combat enemies; Slime and a simple Boss.</li><li>Commented code in two languages (Portuguese and English)</li></ul>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Game commands are displayed on screen at run time, there is an option to hide it if needed.
