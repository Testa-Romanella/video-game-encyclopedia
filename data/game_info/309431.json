Alien forces want to kill all 10 billion humans.</p>\n<p>But humanity is prepared: a sophisticated defense system was developed and installed after scientists were aware of the alien\u2019s intentions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shortly before the attack, it was discovered that followers of a doomsday cult were able to infiltrate the defense initiative. They manipulated the code of the defense system. In every unit they inserted crash code into one or more modules. This leads to a <strong>fatal error</strong>\u00a0of the unit and renders it useless.</p>\n<p>Your job: repair these modules. The preliminary analysis was able to detect the affected modules and sorted the units from one to more crash code modules. You start in level 1 of a virtual representation of the code with just 1 affected module. A cure must be delivered to the <strong>pink module</strong>. After a successful repair mission you proceed with the next level and 2 affected modules. And so on.</p>\n<p>Orient your repair shuttle with the mouse and use the keys A, S, W, D to accelerate in different directions. SPACE to break. Fly very near the affected module until you see the sphere with the cure. Press fire and the module is repaired.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>But hurry up! Time is limited!</strong></p>\n<p>Entry to Bolt Jam #5</p>\n<p>Used assets from the Unity Asset Store:</p>\n<ul><li>Bolt</li><li>Mesh QR Code Generator</li><li>Free Sound FX (adjusted with Audacity)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b2/0b20f23622af32ec1b4c07c0e40fe422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Stefan Scholl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
