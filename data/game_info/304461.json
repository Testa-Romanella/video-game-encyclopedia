This is Aetius; a furry game developer who is struggling and trying his hardest to get a shred of popularity so that he can make more games! <br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a casino styled game where you try to find all of the \"safe spots\" that don't contain red Xs or \"bombs\". Find all of the safe spots or mark all of the bombs and you progress! Fail and you restart or spend some of your points to retain your level and try again.</p>\n<p>Can you get what you need from the nefarious Incubus Gang or are you going to let them get away with their crimes? <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>P = Pause and Instructions<br/>LMB = Uncover tile<br/>RMB = Mark tile as unsafe<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Bristol for helping out with this project!
