It is also present in the design behind the mechanics of the game as there is literally nothing but the ability to walk around or exit via the house door.<br/><br/>Fruits and vegetables fits in via the whole farm theme, namely the fruit trees and small wheat field (along with the storage of those items in the barn).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1155067eb8c2e61f804a0684d79c51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Myndria"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
