Set against the backdrop of the painting \"Prosperous Suzhou\" by the Qing dynasty artist Xu Yang, the game features 600 adorable cats, creating amusing interactions with historical scenes and characters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Prosperous Suzhou\" is a magnificent scroll painting in Chinese art history, following the tradition of \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\". It spans over 12 meters, more than twice the length of \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\", and holds immense historical value. Completed in 1759 after 24 years of work, it is currently housed in the Liaoning Provincial Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe painting depicts over 12,000 people, nearly 400 boats, over 50 bridges, 200 shops, and more than 2,000 buildings, using a combination of scroll format and scattered perspective to portray the everyday life of Suzhou at that time. With meticulous layout, grandeur, and detailed brushwork, it presents the bustling scenes of Suzhou's streets and markets, providing valuable insights into the prosperous era of the Qianlong reign 250 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- Game Features -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Click on the game title to enjoy the complete high-definition \"Prosperous Suzhou\" painting.<br/>\r\n- 6 different scenic environments.<br/>\r\n- 600 charming hand-drawn cats.<br/>\r\n- Relaxing background music.<br/>\r\n- Adorable cat sound effects.<br/>\r\n- 100 carefully crafted achievement icons.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----- Game Controls -----<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Press ESC to toggle visibility of in-game buttons.<br/>\r\n- Click the hint button to quickly locate a cat in the scene; can be used once every 60 seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n------------------------", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T06:58:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e60f55cc67045766daed7d7d42df9927.jpg", "website": "https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44786890-Catnip-studio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Catnip studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Catnip studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
