{"id": 877205, "slug": "time-an-audiovisual-experience", "name": "Time; An Audiovisual Experience", "name_original": "Time; An Audiovisual Experience", "description": "<p>\u00a0This interactive experience showcases a selection of world archaelogical monuments scaled and rotated accurately to experience them in the context of location and time and the resulting position of the sun, moon, and stars. Also demonstrated is the path of the sun and moon at different times of year, in different locations. The audio is 96K high definition, procedurally generated using random numbers, functions, and tone generators, continuing endlessly with unique patterns, and is spatially processed to represent all of the visual elements of the experience; the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the land, and the monuments. The sounds are binaural and use harmonic frequencies of the elements they're chosen to represent, best listened to with good headphones. Upon switching location, it takes some time to adjust to the 'song' of each monument, each of which has it's own key, and voice, designed to represent the land and culture from which it emerged, it's existence and nature defined only by the listener, providing an oasis of sound which both harmonizes with and brings order to an unpredictable and largely unknown universe, giving comfort and stability throughout the passing of time ...</p>\n<p>This is the first interactive experience I've completed, and I hope to use all my energy to bring you many more compelling and original experiences. I am a starting solo developer, and your support would go a long way towards helping me realize my ideas, plus you will get a special bonus version of this experience. To support, please\u00a0Buy me a coffee . For more Info, visit www.Polymorrah.io,\u00a0and don't forget to subscribe on Youtube. Thank you!
