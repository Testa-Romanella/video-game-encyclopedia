Rise of the Owlverlord combines graphics that pack a visual punch and tight controls with the challenge of retro era platforming. Fluidly morph between two dynamically different dream worlds to solve puzzles and combat grueling enemies and bosses. You\u2019ll have to intertwine perky Giana's twirling jump with punky Giana's hammering dash attack to survive her dual nightmare.Change Giana's personality to unlock her unique abilities - you'll need to control both sides to survive her dreams! As Giana changes, so does the world around her.\nGiana\u2019s dreamworlds leap off the screen with gorgeous 3D graphics that morph before your eyes.\n7 rich levels across several distinct worlds, each transforming into the two contrasting dreamworlds. Collecting gems and finding secret locations requires strategy and interchanging the two worlds.\nThe remixed mode is a lot easier to survive than its standard mode. The \u201ceasy\u201d difficulty for Giana should roughly correspond to the \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty for casual platformer games. Hardcore and \u00dcber Hardcore modes also await players who are full masters of the game and quite possibly insane.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T23:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92dcc1357ece2d4dac676af0dec528cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 25, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 510, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Forest Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Black Forest Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
