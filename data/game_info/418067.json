Oh yeah, and I wanted to do a kurosawa/kill bill blood spray effect. That's pretty much the whole basis for this games existence.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the dev art.</p>\n<p>You play as a bee, at night zombie bees come to attack you. WASD moves around although you're constantly going forward as well. Mouse shoots if you have a gun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb2ab3b6e4a9330754cf8c886903db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coffee or Suicide"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
