Also all coding is done just by me.<br/>All sounds effects are from : freesound.org (Owners/Makers will be credited if this ever becomes a full working game)</p>\n\n<p>This game will be a mix between Horror and Puzzle games.</p><p>What i personaly really love about this game idea, is that i choose to use only really ezxtremly low poly texture's but it looks really cool i think atleast.
