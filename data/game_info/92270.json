{"id": 92270, "slug": "scooby-horror-2", "name": "Scooby Horror 2", "name_original": "Scooby Horror 2", "description": "<p>Well, it seems as though you forgot to lock up the backdoor of the Mystery Van, cause Scooby fell out of the van and has been dognapped again, but by a group of Spooky Space Kooks!<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay: You play as Shaggy once again to save Scooby Doo (Trapped in a cage) from a group of ghostly aliens wandering an abandoned Airfield. Find items that'll help you in saving Scooby Doo. Cause each time you play, Scooby will be in a different place, on top of that, he'll be in a sort of jam that you must get him out of in order to pick him up and escape. But the ghostly aliens will traverse the Airfield in search of you. You must hide from them and don't get caught. Remember, they've got tricks and spooks up their sleeves so you better watch your ass.</p>\n<p>Notes: This game is based on, you guessed it, the episode \"Spooky Space Kook\" from 'Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!' I tried to recreate almost every location in that episode. I must've watched that episode three times to try and memorize and recreate each location they visit in the airfield.</p>\n<p>Remember, if you find any bugs or want features added, comment and let me know. I'll add em as soon as I\u00a0can. Also let me know if you post a youtube video about my game. I'd love to know, indeed I would, yes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f408cdf04bcbe25b56445bb1409700ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
