(no multiplayer to be found here)</p>\n<p>Also! this game supports a gamepad :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!</p>\n\n\n<p>This project was made with the intention of literally getting more experience\u00a0with the engine (at that point UE4) and adding more content to my portfolio.</p>\n<p>Later I wanted to use it to fill up with some content on some youtube channel but sadly I don't have the energy to edit a video of this magnitude. After one year (and a half.. I think) got fed up and decided to upload the game and for my youtube\u00a0just made a bare one to kind of say\u00a0I \"archived\"\u00a0\u00a0both objectives\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably the bad thing here is the\u00a0level of fidelity I got doing this\u00a0remake of the 1983 Mario Bros game. Of course, I was not going to have a headache getting a 1:1 so when it looked acceptable I stopped with the development.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>If you can't manage to open the game maybe is because\u00a0I have it compressed with win rar, most probably you'll\u00a0need to download WinRAR (or similar) first to extract this thing and be able to open the game</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Mario Bros 1983 Janky Remake\u00a0\r\n</li><li>1 Player\r\n</li><li>Controller Compatible\r\n</li><li>Unreal Engine 4.24, Blender for models, Audacity for sounds,\u00a0and Paint.net along Gimp for textures\r\n</li><li>Nintendo, you know what belongs to you.
