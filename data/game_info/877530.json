You have your mouse to aim(not really), and your controls are all here.......Just kidding! You have NONE of that!! YAY! NOT!(well, some of it is still there) You have only a gun/shield(yes, a slash) that rotates around you in a \"loose orbit\"(speed is determined by distance). You can still shoot normally(YAY!) and you can move(duh). Also I forgot to tell you something: you can......................(dramatic pause).......................rotate you gun/shield(again, a slash) left or right! How NEAT is that!?!?(eh, not at all) So, apart from that no controls!
