Can't be that hard, or can it?\"</p>\n<p>Move the flying saucer to indirectly control the meteor orbiting around you. The only goal is to hit your opponent with your meteor before he hits you with his. Simple controls - only the four arrow keys - but complicated strategies.</p>\n<p>All assets - Music, Art, Programming, AI and Design - are made by me.</p>\n<p>The AI was build using a 'Genetic Program': a very underrated technique for making stuff like Game\u00a0AI. I build the entire framework myself, and thus most of the effort cannot be seen back in the work. The AI was meant to be way better than it is, but it still manages to surprise me with his actions so now and then.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing :D</p>\n<p>Nick Schuitemaker</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53ba866a10790ef620402100c3354ed7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nick Schuitemaker"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
