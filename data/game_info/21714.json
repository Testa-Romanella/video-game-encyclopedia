Conquer a world of randomly generated, evolving species. You and competing species eat plants and other organisms to grow and reproduce. Other species offspring randomly mutate. You can design your offspring with advancing parts. Each part can be moved and sized to achieve the best combination of acceleration, top speed, turning ability, reach and attack strength. After you and your family eliminate all the other species, the next level is reached where your family splits and mutates into rival families. As levels increase, the challenge grows as your family split size shrinks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55face323152ac88ca56f8cca69fb44.jpg", "website": "http://www.evolutionfightingforsurvival.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiveItGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LiveItGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
