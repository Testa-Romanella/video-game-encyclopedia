This simple platformer has a slight twist, randomly the controls for movement change creating a fun and tense experience as you are precisely platforming with your fingers splayed across the keyboard, testing your mechanical and dexterity skills. Have fun, I sure did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:13:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/177/1777a1c180b35496080b508834eea0f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GreenBeen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
