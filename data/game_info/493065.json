The gameplay is based on Phoenix Wright's courtroom battles (since they're not making more games, I gave up and made my own). This complete first case takes a little over an hour to play to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Content warning:</strong></p>\n<p>Lots of blood (for effect), and a few\u00a0poorly drawn bugs and spiders.</p>\r\nMessage From the Author\r\n<p>Releasing a game publicly is a new experience for me. I hope I'm doing it right.</p>\n<p>I made this case on my own with no budget.\u00a0I want to make lots more cases right away (and I'm working on several right now), but I'm checking to see whether there are essential improvements I should add before going full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>I could release future cases episodically, or in a complete package of six- I haven't decided yet. I should probably charge for the next cases, but they should be pretty cheap, and this first case will always be free standalone.</p>\n<p>Please contact me at deeborm@gmail.com or elsewhere if you have any feedback, critique, comments, or suggestions.</p>\n<p>Have an evil day!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made with Ren'py.</p>\n<p><strong>Royalty-free music and audio assets from:</strong></p>\n<p>One Man Symphony</p>\n<p>Sonniss.com Game Audio GDC Bundle</p>\n<p>Anttis instrumentals</p>\n<p><strong>And a big thank\u00a0you to my testers:</strong></p>\n<p>Alex \"Not The Author\" Katz</p>\n<p>John</p>\n<p>Mary Beach</p>\n<p>rghaga</p>\n<p>Winterlark</p>\n\n<p>And finally, please buy more Phoenix Wright games so they'll actually make another one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5bedf3a474906888e1922e49d85d3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Deeborm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
