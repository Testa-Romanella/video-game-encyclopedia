Most of them are rocks, and the rest are objects to compliment the rocks. While brainstorming for this project I found there was a lot of different rock models, despite all being fairly similar and, compared to other objects, quite mundane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original plan was simply to highlight some of the interesting elements of these objects, but this game now includes more humour and a little bit of narrative to flesh that out.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>W A S D : Movement<br/>Mouse : Look</p>\n<p>https://github.com/Natbugasaurus/Virtual-Museum<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de38d1dcb5353bbda4fdd22bb228b7a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Natbug"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
