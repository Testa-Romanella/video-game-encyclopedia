Spend your resources wisely to repair and add cannons to the hull of the ship.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a very quick piece after taking a few years off of game development. I had a lot of fun with this one for sure. I took inspiration from the first boss in Contra (NES) wondering what it would be like to play the defense wall rather than the players. I had stretch goals of adding more sound effects, multiple turrets, power cores to shield tiles, and a chatty AI that runs the station, but had to scale these items back to make the deadline.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Simply click and build and make your way to the Eden Outpost where you and your crew will be safe!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for check out my game.</p>\n<p>Matt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:00:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f42c8b183800d7264d182ed41be4f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MattBridges6972"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
