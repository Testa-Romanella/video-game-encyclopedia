This game has been produced as part of an assessed piece of content for a University Degree and as such, due to time constraints this is all that can be done for now. HOWEVER there are still plans for further development on the game with extra time, including a revamp of the AI, additional game modes (Capture the Flag, Domination, 'Duck-Duck-Goose') and more content relating to player customisation. So stay tuned for more updates!</p>\n<p>Got feedback for the Dev?
