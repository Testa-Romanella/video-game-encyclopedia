Show them your best moves as you nail through their hits!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Directions<br/></strong><br/></p><p>Each song has notes to hit using the arrow pads. By default, use the Arrow Keys to control the pads (can be changed in options menu).<br/></p>\n<p>For regular notes, simply tap the respective key to hit them. For sustained notes, press and hold the respective key, letting go when the sustain is finished.<br/></p>\n<p>The better you time your hits to the notes, the more score you get! Your final rank is determined by your hit accuracy.</p>\n<p>To skip through cutscenes, simply press and hold the Escape key.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits </strong><br/></p><p>(More detail in-game).</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Gie </strong>- Art, Design, Programming</li><li><strong>Chips Hagenauer</strong> - Music, Writing</li><li><strong>Malong Le</strong> - Programming, Music</li><li><strong>Matthew Nie</strong> - Art, Design</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special\u00a0Thanks\u00a0to:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0Ohio\u00a0State\u00a0Game\u00a0Creation\u00a0Club\u00a0(GCC)\u00a0for inspiring\u00a0us\u00a0to\u00a0make\u00a0this game, starting\u00a0from Global Game Jame 2021.</p>\n<p>GamesPlusJames tutorials, for helping us to kickstart the rhythm game concept in Unity.
