Because so many people have died and the world has come to a standstill with only a few essential services running, the planet has collapsed enormously. With more people still dying of hunger and the virus, the world was left without law and complete chaos. You will be ex-military man Samuel, who will have to fight and survive with all his strength to find food for his wife and daughter who are hidden in a basement of a house. Samuel will have to look for supplies, but it won't be that simple. A group called The SaqYin are looters without compassion and without mercy, they plunder everything and everyone.
