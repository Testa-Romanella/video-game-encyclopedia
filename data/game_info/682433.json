{"id": 682433, "slug": "into-uniform", "name": "into uniform", "name_original": "into uniform", "description": "<p>The game looks like a mix between Pokemon and an action RPG. The developers say they wanted to create a game that people could have fun with 'without being in a panic'.<br/>\nYou play a 'rockstar prosecutor' who's 'pursuing a case of serious corruption'. The idea is that you break into secret law minces that are too strong for the mostly non-violent criminals in the area, so you're forced to fight hand-to-hand with the larger criminals.\n\nAs you gain experience, you can upgrade your new abilities, including super-powers, and buy more weapons and armour to boost your effectiveness.\n\nYou can also buy new armour or weapons with cash, which actually feels quite nice.\n\nOuthouse Media do mention that this game can be a bit frustrating when playing with a partner, but I'm really looking forward to seeing it.\n\nYou can get it from Amazon UK, Amazon US, and Amazon Germany.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc6/dc6437c6e9b2a50b223193b17052aaf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
