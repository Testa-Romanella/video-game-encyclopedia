The world is fragmented into multiple eras happening at once, with the Web's keystone, the Epoch, having been fragmented across the temporal storm, along with the scattering of the citizens into the timezones. One such displaced individual, the young Krono, is tasked with recovering the fragments of the Epoch in order to restore it, and disrupt the plan of the mysterious Aeon to rule over the chaotic ruin of Tempores.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W/D Keys or Left/Right\u00a0Arrow Keys - Move Left/Right</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space Bar - Jump</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button - Click Menu Buttons</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aab8ae93d8fd1f6cb9e4e6338cc7c35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GDM-Soundbreaker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
