The 3D meshes and materials could be used from anywhere. I designed the level using Platformer Assets I got from Gumroad.</p>\n<p>The character and the winning animation were imported from Mixamo, and the running animation was of the mannequin inside the engine. The skeleton of the character was retargeted with the skeleton of the Unreal mannequin to use the inbuilt engine animations.</p>\n<p>A blueprint actor was made out of a 3D mesh of the Avalon logo and particle effects of purple smoke which gave +10 points whenever the character hits the mesh. A blueprint actor was made out of a 3D mesh of a book which was superimposed with a decal of text MBA and combined with a particle effect of fire which reduces health by 10 units whenever the character hits the mesh.</p>\n<p>Fire pits and death pits were created so that if the character falls into them it's game over and the game could be restarted. A Heads Up Display (HUD) was created with two variables: Health which was represented as a horizontal bar, and Score which was represented in integer multiples of 10.</p>\n<p>The lighting is bright to show a sunny exterior scene.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf1a3e746670c1d84a3823160b25582d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anshik Jain"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
