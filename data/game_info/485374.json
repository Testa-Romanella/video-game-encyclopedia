I definitely plan on updating the game post-jam with new content and just more things to do in general, however!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T03:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a330a17e242ca405011893ae01eca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["goobea"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
