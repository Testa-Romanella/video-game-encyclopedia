{"id": 654419, "slug": "astral-tournament-itch", "name": "Astral tournament (itch)", "name_original": "Astral tournament (itch)", "description": "<p>Astral Tournament card game where you fight other mages (computer or other players) for control of magical planes, by strategically using and casting creatures and magical spells.</p>\n<p>Play multiplayer vs other people (currently LAN only)</p>\n<p>The creatures and spells are of the following\u00a0\u00a0magical elements: Air, Fire, Water, Earth and Death.\u00a0Each mage starts the duel with 50 life points. Each\u00a0mage has five numbers - they represent his power or\u00a0ability within the five magic elements. These abilities\u00a0affect the spells and the strength of each spell the\u00a0mage can cast. (e.g. if your Fire power is 5 you can\u00a0cast spells or summon fire creatures equal to or less\u00a0than the 5th level). Each time you cast a spell or\u00a0summon a creature, your remaining strength is reduced\u00a0by the cost of that spell or creature. However, each\u00a0turn all of your powers are increased by 1.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each creature has two stats: Attack Strength\u00a0and Life Number. If the creature attacks any opposing\u00a0creatures, that defending creature's life is reduced\u00a0by the attack strength of the attacking creature. If\u00a0the creature's life is reduced to 0, the creature dies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The object of the duel is to defeat your opponent\u00a0by reducing his life number from 50 to 0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a7/5a79796f9d9a3cc1bd3a9c891bafb3f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zereb"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
