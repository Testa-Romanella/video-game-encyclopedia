Day after day.\r\n\r\nThe design of Space Nomads grew on the desire to create, not only a PC game, but also a game made of exploration, creativity and most importantly: cooperation! It was also very important for us to choose a game design that would allow us to have an open, community-centric and iterative development, filled with a large amount of further possible improvements based on feedback from the community.\r\n\r\n- Play in a randomly generated world\r\n- Cooperative multi-player gameplay\r\n- Be creative and build your own base\r\n- Explore different environments\r\n- DRM free\r\n- Collect resources\r\n- Discover/research blueprints, craft weapons, turrets, traps and more\r\n- Defend your base from insectoid aliens\r\n- Survive and ultimately search for a way to escape the planet\r\n- Dedicated server\r\n\r\nDemo and Crowd funding\r\n********************************\r\nWe are excited to share with you our crowd funding campaign alongside a free alpha demo of the game.\r\nBack the project to get all following updates of Space Nomads, from alpha to release, and help us shape the game!\r\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/projects/space-nomads\r\nhttp://spacenomadsthegame.com/DemoDownload.php\r\n\r\nPress\r\n*******\r\n\"Space Nomads itself looks hugely promising, as it\u2019s a co-op sort-of tower defence with hefty and diverse building options. There\u2019s a longer game to it, however, which involves surviving until you can \u201cultimately search for a way to escape the planet\"\r\nRock Paper Shotgun\r\n\r\n\"...AND OH MY GOD, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE STARSHIP TROOPERS GAME I\u2019VE WANTED FOR YEARS!\"\r\nIndie Statik\r\n\r\n\"I believe that this game is worth observing, it\u2019ll be interesting to see just what features they add. I, for one, am hoping for curtains and carpets.\"\r\nIndieGameMag", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b536c84de5caab0673c15022dc0a397_9JgVClw.jpg", "website": "http://spacenomadsthegame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loading Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Loading Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
