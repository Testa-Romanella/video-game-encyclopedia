It was created as my final project in the first semester of LIU Post's Game Design Masters program, mostly as an experiment to see if I could make a 3D game using the 2D Processing IDE.</p><p>90% of all purchases/donations (up to ~$30,000) will go towards paying off tuition.  The other 10% goes to itch.io for being radical.  I don't expect to pay off my schooling from this game, but every penny helps!</p><p>Post your high scores in the comments!</p><p>Game design, programming, and music - Eric Guadara<br/>Sprites - Alonzo Steadman<br/>Special Thanks - Andy Wallace and LIU Post.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0cad9e43311826a66ea6fbde298bcc7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eric Guadara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
