Awoken with a fright, J Doe stands to observe his surroundings. In the small little room a key is seen sitting atop a table. Equipped with the key, he finds the exit to the room. Unlocking the door he adventures down and begins his journey to escape. Walking through the dark empty cabin he comes across the exit. Using the key to unlock the door he finds himself back to where he started. In the little room, a table is set to the side with single light flickering above. The key is seen, shifting forms from a key to a ruin. Picking up the ruin/key, he journeys back through the cabin once again. Only this time the very world around him has changed. Shadows have shifted into shapes and objects have morphed into creatures. The further down he journeys, the more insane his mind is becoming. Finding himself back at the exit, he unlocks the door once again. Only to appear back to the little dark room. Facing the mirror with the key set in his hand, he begins raising the key to his head, unlocking his mind to escape the truth.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb5459d576236d10cea9c792534a5c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dream Beans Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
