Your only defense is light as this keeps the deadly Smog at bay and hurts the dark monsters lingering everywhere. The lightrunner you control is skilled but relies on energy to generate light and it is energy that rules his actions, how long you have to complete a mission and how many monsters you can fight.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou, the player, have to make tactical choices in short turns to survive the claustrophobic levels and suspenseful missions. Will you sneak or blast monsters with your rifle? Maybe you prefer to ambush the monsters and use the light blade to take them down silently?<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t Whatever you do make sure you are able to make it to a safe haven and recharge your battery!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis project has halted and forum/support might not be responded to\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\twebsite: http://sensingdesign.ddns.net/\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tforum: http://sensingdesign.ddns.net/forum/\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tsupport: http://sensingdesign.ddns.net/support/\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA special note for the great audio guys that helped us from the other side of the country:<br/>\r\n\tLeonhard van Voort: Audio @ Youtube<br/>\r\n\tJonathan Howe: Audio @ http://jonathan-howe.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tJohnny G.
