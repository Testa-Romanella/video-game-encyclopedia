(Demo)", "description": "<p>Hero Soul is a 2D pixel ARPG with Rogue-Lite game\u00a0play elements, which incorporates traditional RPG/JRPG game play with Rogue-Lite elements. This <strong>Demo </strong>includes the 2nd level of the game, called The Koros Forest.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Long ago, the continent of Terra was shattered by a great disaster separating the mortal races onto islands.\u00a0 From that disaster 4 powerful island kingdoms rose: The Kavic Dominion, The Gestalt Republic,\u00a0 The Valakan Federation, and finally The Kingdom of Alteria.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are a citizen of Alteria, a prosperous kingdom with rich supplies of Fire\u00a0Essence. While Alteria is currently at peace,\u00a0 diplomatic tensions are building between Alteria and the Kavic Dominion.\u00a0On the other hand, dark clouds are gathering as an ancient\u00a0evil is returning to Alteria. More than ever the kingdom could use a hero, but who will take up that mantle? Follow the story of Cecilia and watch events unfold\u00a0as she learns and sees if she has what it takes to be a hero!</p>\n\n<p>In Hero Soul you can cast spells in addition to your normal attacks.\u00a0Spells builds vary from run to run. As you play you will discover spell (Arcana) cards. Using these cards, you can then add them to your Spell Deck using the Major and Minor Arcana System. With this system you can create deadly and amazing spell chain combos or even discover long lost hidden Arcana!</p>\n\n<p>The landscape of Alteria is always shifting, and no two levels will be alike. Experience increased replay-ability with procedurally generated levels quests and monsters! No level or run will be exactly the same and no story will be either!<br/></p>\n\n<p>While the game's name is Hero Soul, the Hero Soul also refers to the modular talent tree system that handles your character's skills and talents. This system allows you to mix and match different hero archetypes to create your ideal hero. Heroes are are discovered randomly as you progress thorough the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Additionally, the choices you make as a hero will also impact the outcome of the game and the events that will happen during the game.</p>\n<p>I've mostly worked on this project solo, but\u00a0had a lot of help from some amazing people!</p>\n<p><strong>Eadgear</strong>, character art</p>\n<p><strong>HiddenOne</strong>, character sprites</p>\n<p><strong>Sharm</strong>, Germania Tileset, World Map Tileset</p>\n<p><strong>Vnitti</strong>, Taiga AssetPack &amp; Glacial Mountain AssetPack</p>\n<p><strong>Nenad Simic</strong>, UI Noise</p>\n<p><strong>Eriegrass</strong>, NPC sprites</p>\n<p><strong>Xelu</strong>, controller/key sprites</p>\n<p><strong>Jason</strong>, <strong>finalbossblues</strong>, sprites</p>\n<p><strong>rvros</strong>, Monster Sprites</p>\n<p>Chau Ho, Story</p>\n<p>Ken Sparks, Sprites</p>\n<p>TextMeshPro</p>\n<p>Music:<br/><strong>David Kim</strong>, Koros Forest 1, UI Sounds</p>\n<p>[Copyright] <strong>Knamica </strong>| Unity Technologies Japan</p>\n<p>[Copyright] <strong>GT-K</strong> | Unity Technologies Japan</p>\n<p>Misc Doodads:<br/>[Copyright](C) 2012 ENTERBRAIN, INC;\u00a0<br/>artists Archeia, EvilEagles, Tobby Ong, Caz</p>\n<p>[Credits in progress, more to come as I add more]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/7973a9a8d011def9ce6499047f67ebed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["raynesu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
