Play as the attacker to take down the enemy towers and base building.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>Use your regenerating elixir to spawn four different troop types on field or use your Super Power to cast a spell and hit every enemy object. Watch as your troops march their way to the towers and enemy base straight in front of them. Create Archers, Wizards, Knights, and huge Golems to help take the enemy down!</p>\n<p><strong>Win or Lose:</strong><br/>Win by defeating the enemy base, lose by running out of time. Keep it goin' and do your best to take down those towers!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Point and click.</p>\n<p><strong>*Note:</strong><br/>This will get impossible at some point. It adds an additional tower to the enemy side each time you win. So eventually there will be too many to defeat in the time allotted. If you reach this point, just go to \"Settings\" in the main menu and click the \"Reset Save\" button to start from the beginning again.</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Store Packages Used:</strong><br/>Simple UI<br/>Epic Toon FX<br/>AllSky Free - 10 Sky / Skybox Set<br/>Low Poly Towers Pack<br/>Modular RPG Heroes Polyart<br/>Battle Wizard Poly Art<br/>RPG Footman PRB HP Polyart<br/>Mini Legion Rock Golem PBR HP Polyart<br/>POLYGON - Knights Pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:57:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c57d1213df007ac587fe6bbde2eaf5a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Wolfe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
