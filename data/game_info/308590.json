We'll make them available later!<br/></p>\n<p>Originally I planned to make 4 levels (lol) with broadly different themes. It turns out I couldn't even bring the first one to 100%, not even 75% (couldn't finish a lot of art that was planned). But it's playable and we're happy with the result. We also got a satisfactory tutorial. The game lacks polishing and I had no time to implement losing, or percentage tracking.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure about the difficulty. I feel it's ok, but I might have heard these songs about a thousand times while developing, so it's definitely a point that I might have to\u00a0come back to. The level itself requires much more precise input than the tutorial.</p>\n<p>Check it out and it would be a pleasure if you tell me what you think!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Code and art: <strong>Dan Cipolla</strong></p>\n<p>Music: <strong>Bruno Siqueira &amp; Dan Cipolla</strong></p>\n<p>Used 3 sound effects licensed under CC0 Universal/Public Domain:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/pan14/sounds/334031/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/448081/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/KorgMS2000B/sounds/54415/<br/></p>\n\n<p>And one explosion sprite from a free package from the Unity Asset Store (<strong>Robot Shooting Game Sprite (Free)</strong>)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:53:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/330/330f757cf3054e721621a6366ec308db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
