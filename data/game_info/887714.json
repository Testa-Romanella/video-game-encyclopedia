You are helping materials scientists at Brigham Young University find out how materials work at almost atomic levels! Your contributions here matter, and are helping to publish real scientific data to the world!<br/><br/>Follow the story as the world is struggling against a new ice age, trying to survive sub-zero temperatures while energy sources are running out. Reggie feels this personally as his family struggles to find heating for their home, in spite of creating incredible new inventions. What Reggie doesn't realize is that this invention holds the key to solving many of the problems the city is facing! Work with a team of engineers to solve the many issues facing the city, and uncover an undersea energy source that could keep everyone warm:<br/><ul><li>Solve real materials science problems the team faces</li><li>Learn how materials work in real life situations</li><li>Dive deep into a harsh environment</li><li>Face increasing challenges as weaknesses appear</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T03:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f3a0c2913c9b9a3fb69fcfaa3b6d5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BYU Materials Innovation Lab"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["BYU Mechanical Engineering"], "esrb_rating": null}
