There are always numerous things to improve, I've limited myself to only one-hour for fixes, to limit the \"cheating\" on the event time.</p>\n<p>#### Bugfix patchnote :<br/>- Game reset on death or win is now working finely<br/>- Overall physics is improved for pickable objects<br/>- Death is now triggered only once<br/>- Improved the river death collider<br/>- Repaired the random music player during day time<br/>- Character movement should be more precised<br/>- Smooth the terrain between the bridge and the fire</p>\n<p>- Increase the camera FOV. I didn't wanted to implement a real Y axis movement, that should not be part of a bugfix quick update. However, it was indeed really hard to see the environment, so I've increased the FOV a bit, althought it distorts a bit the image.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e9710f62924cb1b04881fc1bddf51358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Barbiche"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
