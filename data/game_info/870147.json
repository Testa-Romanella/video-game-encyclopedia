The dead are restless, wanting to take advantage of this moment to invade the realm of the living. Your job, as keeper of the cemetery, is to keep them underground until the night is over and their souls return to the realm of the dead, where they can rest until the next Halloween.</p>\n<p>This game was made for\u00a0Godot Wild Jam #50. It's a fast-paced, top-down game where you need to survive for as long as possible. Place flowers on the graves\u00a0to calm the dead before they rise because, after that, they will follow you endlessly. A bonus awaits those who survive until the end of the night!</p>\n<strong><em>Controls*:</em></strong>\n<p><strong><em>WASD</em></strong>\u00a0or <strong><em>ARROWS</em></strong> for Move\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Space</em></strong>\u00a0or <strong><em>Enter</em></strong> or\u00a0<strong><em>Numlock_0</em>\u00a0</strong>to place Flower</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T08:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7a/f7a939358bb3e828c597c9857f286283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noskire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
