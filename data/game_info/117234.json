Chinese characters have been around for 5 thousand years, and any explanations as to why they are the way they are at best educated guesses, and at worse, pure speculation. We have researched the characters as best we can with the help of a professor of the Chinese language, but still it is very unlikely that we are correct in all of our explanations. We apologize for our inaccuracies, and we encourage you to research the Chinese language in more depth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c0be924ea5d7452ad6a4787142d17f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eirlys"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
