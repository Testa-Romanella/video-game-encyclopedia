{"id": 620302, "slug": "tethered-souls", "name": "Tethered Souls", "name_original": "Tethered Souls", "description": "<p><strong><em>Fundamentals:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tethering an enemy not only stops them in their tracks, but also grants you the use of a weapon similar to what they use. Killing them while they're tethered, using your tether as a\u00a0grappling hook,\u00a0or running out of ammo will break any current connection however and leave you unarmed.</p>\n<p>Thankfully your tether also makes for a great grappling hook. Use it to better maneuver to a more advantageous spot.</p>\n<p>Try to survive for as many rounds as possible!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>LMB - Soul tether an enemy (use their weapon) / Shoot (While tethered to an enemy)</p>\n<p>RMB - Grappling hook / Break tether</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>TAB - Pause (Sensitivity options in this menu)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enemies:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Grunt - Weak and follows on foot and occasionally shoots a single shot. Tethering gives a pistol.</p>\n<p>Floater- Flies through the air and will fire in quick bursts. Tethering gives an Assault Rifle.</p>\n<p>Tank - Tough, slowly follows on foot, and fires Rockets. Tethering gives an RPG.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tips:</em></strong></p>\n<p>-Try to always be moving!\u00a0You move significantly faster in the air and if you time your jumps well you can carry your momentum!</p>\n<p>- You can wall run if there's a wall to the left or right of you. Pressing space will let you wall jump.</p>\n<p>- Health pickups will spawn every 3 rounds and they heal 25 health points. You'll have to grapple up the trees to reach them though.</p>\n<p>- Rockets do more damage to targets closer to the middle of the explosion. That includes you!</p><p>- You can tether to the same enemy again if your connection broke. If they're still alive that is.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Known bugs:</em></strong></p>\n<p>- If you go fast enough you can clip through walls</p>\n<p>- No audio (Unity kept preventing any import of audio)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38a/38a51e7f97cd338880d35f1e09560bca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Triple Jump Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
