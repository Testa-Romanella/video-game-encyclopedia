That kinda came out weird. This game was developed for a two week one button game jam; the only input in the entire game is the space bar. With it you change the direction of pipes, leading the balls to their goal. Try to get the balls to their goals in as few presses as you can! </p><p>Pipes &amp; Presses was developed by Andy and Austin. </p><p>Music by Moonbeau</p><p>Game font by Typodermic Fonts</p><p>Made in Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8ede63b95b1555107a1b0b38fb188d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Austin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
