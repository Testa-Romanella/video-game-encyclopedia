I am a solo-developer, and this is my first fully completed project. I spent quite a lot of time with it, but i have no idea what it's worth. I have decided to release it for free, with the option to donate any amount you want. I am a pretty poor student, and the current covid-19 virus has had a large impact on my income. I would like you to consider donating if you found it enjoyable. If you can't donate because of the current situation, i fully understand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have a nice day,<br/>Albin Frank</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:37:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe5777d2887727a8efc0a572764477b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Shad3x"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
