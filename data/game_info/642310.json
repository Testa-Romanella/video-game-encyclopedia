This game was inspired by an old\u00a0 flash game I used to play back in high school where you played as a cube dodging increasingly difficult obstacles. While this is by no means even close to what that game used to be, I wanted to do my best to approximate.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Trek on for as long as you can while dodging through an endless array of obstacles! As time moves on, the game will get faster and faster, so make sure to have a keen eye and fast reflexes. But be careful! If you either hit an obstacle or fall off the lane, it's Game Over and you have to start again.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is absolutely barebones right now, but I do plan on adding some features in the future, such as:</p>\n<p>-Color Picker, so you can change the color of your cube!</p>\n<p>-Color schemes for the lane/obstacles</p>\n<p>-A high score system</p>\n<p>-Music! (It's very quiet right now, might want to put on spotify in the background)</p>\n<p>-A \"levels\" mode.</p>\n\n<p>You can pay what you want or you can grab this for absolutely free, it makes no difference! I just want to put games out there that are fun, simple, and affordable.
