Press enter, copy the netplay url, and send it to a friend!</p>\n<p>I'd love to say I made all the art, but I really just called the DrawLine function repeatedly to make\u00a0basically everything.<br/>The music/sound effects were made by me, sorry in advance for that. It's\u00a0basically\u00a0 the first time I've ever made music.</p>\n<p>GitHub link:\u00a0https://github.com/ericvilcu/wasm4jam2022<br/>You can also find it here:\u00a0https://wapm.io/ericvilcu/trials-of-the-dark-sea</p>\n<p>Because there was no theme, I made some challenges for myself:<br/>1. No libraries. (except for the wasm4.h header) (implementing sqrt was fascinating)<br/>2. No malloc/free/new/delete. Only static memory</p>\n<p>The cover image was made by my good friend ZeloxArt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T07:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84c2f44e4f6609bb70aa5f99d9ab333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EricVilcu"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
