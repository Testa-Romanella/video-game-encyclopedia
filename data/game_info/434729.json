WordChain instead strives to be a relaxed experience where the only goal is to keep the chain going to the next word.</p>\n<p>Instructions:<br/>1) Place tiles vertically or horizontally to form words, connecting to previously played words.<br/>2) You will receive one point every time you successfully place a word.<br/>3) You will draw one less tile than the number you placed, and one extra for every word formed above the first.<br/>4) Unused tiles clear the board every round.<br/>5) There are special tiles to draw +1, draw +2, or swap all tiles. Play on them to activate.<br/>6) In any word placement there must be at least one brand new word.<br/>7) Choose 'Give Up' when you feel you can no longer keep your streak alive.</p>\n<p>That's it! Please enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97d112f0f31710e604790d6b2e50de41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
