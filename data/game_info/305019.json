This week's design was allowed only a single button for gameplay. Hold down D until the pointer is hovering over the correct number, and attempt to defuse the C4 as the speed ramps up!</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Game-A-Week is an intensive project module in which students will create about ten prototype games over the semester, (almost) one per week. The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p><p>Week #1: 26.03.2019 - 02.03.2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Repository</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/nomi_proto_1<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Everything was made by ME, HA-HA!</p>\n<p>Music was made with Beepbox.</p>\n<p>Supervised by\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai as part of the Game-A-Week project course in the summer semester of 2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T02:19:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91de7c752f517770859ff1f2f13b9632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naomi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
