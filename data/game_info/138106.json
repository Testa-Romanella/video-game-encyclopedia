Matching colors incorrectly or hitting\u00a0oncoming walls will drain your oco and send you spiraling backwards. Power each oco all the way\u00a0to have something special happen..\u00a0\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Like QWOP, Ocoboco is a game of patience, endurance, and mastering muscle memory. The three actions\u00a0used to control your oco are\u00a0Swap, Push and Bend and can be used separate, or in conjunction with one another to produce different formations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q / E -\u00a0Bend outer pieces upward.<br/>A / D - Push outer pieces outward.<br/>Z / C - Bend outer pieces downward.<br/>Spacebar - Swap the center pieces and, if connected, the outer pieces as well.</p>\n<p>(If you're having trouble viewing the full height of the game due to screen resolution, you can you Ctrl - to scale your brower back)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Graphics/code/SFX were made custom for this game while\u00a0music (by Frank Nora) was taken from\u00a0https://gamesounds.xyz/.<br/>If you enjoy the game in all its roughness and see the potential as I do, please leave a comment\r\n and let me know if you like the game a month format.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Happy Gaming!\u00a0 - Kees Luyendijk\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a5532baaa014ebc9c2a2763686e50332.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stilaan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
