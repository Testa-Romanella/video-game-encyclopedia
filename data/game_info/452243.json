At the press of a button you will be transported between two similar but slightly different dimensions. Using these powers you must reach the end of the level as in any platformer. This is currently just a demo, so many things such as the menus are unfinished and in a very primitive state. There will also be many bugs, so watch out for that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fdc14f34600162b2c903915af8cb492.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LethalChicken"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
