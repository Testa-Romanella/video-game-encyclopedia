A very short plot, but actually all you need to get going. While Lyle travels his world to find his cat, he faces monster after monster and gets better and better abilities. There isn&#39;t much to say on this little gem of a game. One thing will however strike you as soon as the game starts - Lyle is a black main character. If you remember another black main character in a game, please feel free to write about it in the forums.</p>\n<p>Lyle is definitely worth a try from anyone. The atmosphere is like in the good old 8-bit days. And the music is great.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T17:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3f922443b6000f1150c1997794dfec9.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/Lyle_in_Cube_Sector", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
