Now that he's dead, it doesn't have to be so anymore... <br/><br/>Dear Red is a game based on two choices: Truth or Lie. Each of your choices will lead to a different result. In the game, you are Red, a girl with a plan to look for her mother's murderer to end his life. You have planned this for a long time, but nothing goes as expected when you're facing the one whose neck you long to stab day and night. <br/><br/>There are 16 - 17 endings, and some of them are short, some are long. The playtime will be longer or not, it all depends on you and your choices.<br/><br/>[Extended Version]<br/>- Endings changed<br/>- Graphics changed<br/>- Bonus content (Digital artbook included)<br/>- Gameplay changes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-08T20:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/adaf6e6d1bda8fe63b94b10dbe559378.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.7, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 271, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lee Sang"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sometimes You"], "esrb_rating": null}
