I chose to go with a brawler / beat-em-up type game where you only have one arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Move</strong>: Arrows</p>\n<p>Punch: Z<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>With a freshly amputated arm, Rick wanders out of the hospital. Still deeply confused from the abundance of anesthesia\u00a0in his body, Rick believes that he a character in a beat-em-up video game. He wanders the streets, beating up all those who stand in his way - though they are innocent people, or family members desperately trying to get him back in the hospital.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Punch enemies with Z</li><li>There is a 25% chance that Rick will try to punch with his amputated arm, which will do no damage. (He's still getting used to having no arm)</li><li>The game ends when you defeat your mom.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Damon Bolesta (dbolesta@gmail.com): Design, Programming, Art, Music</p>\n<p>Made in JavaScript using the\u00a0Phaser Framework\u00a0(v2.6.2).
