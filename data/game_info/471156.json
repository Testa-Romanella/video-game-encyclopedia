However it works out, just have fun, open up to new ideas and opportunities, and let me know what you come up with.</p>\n<p>Here's the video on me using the tool if you want to check it out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T02:48:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d281bdba0b9c6109afe3210ebc6fdaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheBuffED"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
