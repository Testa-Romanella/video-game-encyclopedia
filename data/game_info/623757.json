There are also wave conditions to be met before moving on to a new wave such as the amount of enemies to spawn and how often spawning occurs. Each new wave the number of enemies to spawn will increase automatically. Also, there is a points collection system where you obtain points from killing an enemy, these points are added into a bank which can be spent on items as shown in the video.</p>\n<p>I chose to create this in order to gain some practice making a versatile game mechanic that can be used for several genres of games, making a lot of my design and prototyping skills transferrable into any future project.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T09:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa0d08bca98855f981c45656bebf7093.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Davies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
