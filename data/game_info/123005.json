Touch \u00a0some lava, ghosts, or basicly anything that's not a wall or rope, and you are back at the entrance of the room. You can save though. You'll navigate through mazes, if a wall looks funny, or hear a faint noise, you can find secret rooms with huge treasures - you can collect coins. There is a whole secret level to explore. You'll probably say stuff like: 'This room is falling apart!', 'Why lava is following me?' or 'MY SHADOW JUST ATE ME!!!'.<br/></p>\n<p>Finally, if you are interested in the super-fine art of crafting levels, there is a level editor for you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee91f60368f6d6ff88c023ddda474f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["peterfuleki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
