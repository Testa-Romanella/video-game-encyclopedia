Let's not talk about balance and optimization, nobody has been interested in this for a long time. In our amazing game, you will find large levels filled with nothing, as well as a lot of cute waifu in tight suits that you have to destroy. For this, you will receive in-game money, with which you can buy better weapons to exterminate enemies even more effectively. Or you can unlock good weapons right away by purchasing in-game currency for as little as $0.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> 4 Levels + 2 more levels for tank battle<br/></li><li> Classic modern weapon arsenal<br/></li><li> Armed women with tail and rabbit ears<br/></li><li> Free in-app purchases<br/></li><li> FPS, TPS, no NFTs<br/></li><li> Soak up the atmosphere of the AAA project</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T03:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da2/da29a1ac4c004dfca1df38bd81c0fc3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sweet Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sweet Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
