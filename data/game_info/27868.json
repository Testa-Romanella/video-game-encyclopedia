The resulting \n      sprite sheet is a PNG image.\n    </p><p>\n      Tiles sets are comprised of 64x64 tile pixel art that is assembled into \n      a 16x16 grid. The resulting tile set is a PNG image.\n    </p><p>\n      Maps are 256x256 grids of tiles that reference an existing tile set.\n    </p><p>\n      Levels are a combination of layered maps, a player sprite, and multiple \n      non-player sprites. Levels come in three forms: Overworld, Platformer, \n      and Terrain. Each level can be entered on Edit Mode or Play Mode. In \n      Edit Mode, the player sets up the placement of layers and locations of \n      sprites. In Play Mode, the levels follow standard mechanisms for physics \n      and collision-detection.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f4420fabba426779f90b5a4c4ea0d5c.jpg", "website": "http://sdkspriter.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["HullBreach Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
