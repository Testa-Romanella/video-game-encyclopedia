Number refers to size of fish.<br/><br/>-If you havent realized yet, the keypad to the right is a database. Key in the size of the contact and it will return what it is. (Ie: key in \"1\" and it returns \"TUNA\")</p>\n<br/>=Misc things incase you get stuck=\r\n<p>- Press M again to exit the messages menu, M toggles it on and off.<br/><br/>- If you typed the length wrongly, typing more than 3 numbers resets it.<br/><br/>- If you get stuck at the end and you cant rescue because \"DANGER NEARBY\", that means whatever hostile thing in the neighbouring chamber is still alive<br/><br/>-If you dont know what the keypad thing is. It basically refers to the keypad to the right of the screen. Input the lil number by the side of the contact (ie 1 for 1 m) and click search; and it will give you the type of the contact (assuming it's on the database of course) <this important<br=\"\" is=\"\"></this><br/>- Decoys essentially drop a fake \"you\" which fish will attack, and after destroying go back to passive mode. You can use this to escape or gain some distance (provided you dont provoke em with sonar again)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><em>Made for Ludum Dare 48 under the theme \"Deeper and deeper\"<br/>Not actually based on the unfortunate Indonesian tragedy, but the manga \"One day in the life of Ivan Dejavu\"'s 2nd chapter<br/><br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2eceee2880da9a923c816cb007fea96d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Darylsteak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
