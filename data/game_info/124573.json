Find your way to reach higher levels and increase your score.</p><p>To achieve this, you have to jump off objects inside the tower. Bouncing off the upside of black boxes gives a score bonus.</p><p>Supported input devices: keyboard, joypad (I recommend an Xbox 360 \u00ae Controller)</p><p>You can open a configuration menu by holding [Ctrl] (or [Cmd] on OSX) while starting the game.</p><p>Caution!
