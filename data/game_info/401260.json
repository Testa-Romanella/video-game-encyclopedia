(especially since I'm not a writer) but I will try.. In the Age of the Imperium people travel in-between the stars via a kinda \"hyperspace\"... which happens to be hell.... but the Imperium would not survive if it could not travel in this hyperspace faster than light..\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this Demo, I've only got 4 \"generic worlds\" and a placement for \"Holy Terra\" (I've got a beautiful Terra scene, but it's not included here, because of \"feature creep\".. and only a few \"landmarks\" in the Warp to navigate by (you will need to navigate eventually), and only 1 encounter, a \"warpstorm\"..\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"the Eye of Terror\" not much here yet, because it's mostly a \"background scenery piece at the moment... but the Eye is a very large Warpstorm..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Warpstorms, basicly alter the shape and flow of this hyperspace, meaning a planet can move, or be cut off from the rest of the Imperium in the Warp.. it's physical location wont change, but the route to the world through the warp is constantly in flux.. and according to the Lore, only 80-85% of ships actually make it to their destination (in an Imperium of one million worlds, that's a lot of lost ships) and some that do arrive get caught in strange time twists often arriving decades or centuries late.</p>\n<p>Dec 24th..\u00a0 late</p>\n<p>uploading a test version, will replace it tomorrow\u00a0</p>\n<p>I got a basic \"hyperspace\" working.. I have some test world in, fly into any of the test worlds, or \"holy terra\" to go to the Random Solar System.. everything loads to the same random system right now for testing..\u00a0</p>\n<p>once in the system, there should be 3 asteroid fields, 2 worlds and a gas giant.. also, there should be a test spacehulk floating around somewhere..\u00a0 Flying into that Blue World, should take you to the actual planet..\u00a0</p>\n<p>and tomorrow I should be back to working on the heretic, but everything is very basic, and doesn't yet look as good as the old version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>view of interplanetary \"warpspace\"</p>\n\n<p>same location, but in real space.. that yellow blobby thing will eventually become the center of the galaxy.. doesn't really look like it right now.. but as you travel around the galaxy, the view should change, landmarks like the Eye of Terror and the Astronomicon will appear in different places</p>\n\n\n<p>and same location, in the Galaxy overhead map.... really really really zoomed in</p>\n<p>\u2026. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/715c4f355db690c4c2de7e8904226ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DerrickMoore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
