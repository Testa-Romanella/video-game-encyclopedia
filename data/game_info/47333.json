Whatever it takes to get the job done!<br/>- <strong>Top down view</strong>: drive the pickup shooting at enemies and buildings alike, roaming freely in the city while you try to get to the core, through the gates. Search for missions, stores, enemies and even secrets.<br/><br/>On top of that, you can level up and <strong>get new skills</strong>, and collect money to <strong>purchase upgrades for your weapons</strong>, and other items at the Andy's stores scattered across the city<br/><br/>(*) Friend not included with the game", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b145157d85020c798fbb7fffb76cc72e.jpg", "website": "http://crazybitsstudios.com/?page_id=283&amp;preview=true", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazyBits Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CrazyBits Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
