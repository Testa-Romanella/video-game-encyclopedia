Every tile can only be touched once before it falls into nothingness. The game features 50 different levels and gets harder as you progress, always accompanying you with relaxing piano tunes.</p><p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p><strong>v1.1</strong><ul><li>Fixed music volume setting being overriden on every startup.</li><li>Added dark background option. This can be enabled in the settings menu and will only be applied to the ingame background, not the menu background.</li></ul><p>Note that this update will reset your settings and you will have to apply your screen resolution, music and sound volume, etc. again.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a8/3a8267847eda3cdb21df4cbaeffe5da1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moltenplay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
