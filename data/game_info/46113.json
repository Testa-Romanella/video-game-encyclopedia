The search engine uses alpha-beta pruning together with several enhancements to prove that the game is a first-player win. In fact, the first player can always win within 21 moves (plies) if the player starts in the middle column.<br/><br/>Pop Out starts the same as traditional gameplay, with an empty board and players alternating turns placing their own colored discs into the board. During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top or, if one has any discs of his or her own color on the bottom row, remove (or \"pop out\") a disc of one's own color from the bottom.<br/><br/>Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, changing their relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection. The first player to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bcb29dbd8cca65c8c2ad82ba40404be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClassicBoardGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["ClassicBoardGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
