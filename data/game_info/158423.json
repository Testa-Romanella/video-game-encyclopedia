A mysterious baronet comes to your door one day with a deal. Will you take it or no?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Castle and Ruins Bitsy Jam and was made super late as I didn't know it was on until like 2 days ago! So around two days of work yet again this time -though the game is much shorter. Thank you to Adam Le Doux for making Bitsy and the jam and I hope you enjoy this small game.</p>\n<p>You can't date a moth again sorry.\u00a0 There are three different endings so try and find them all.</p>\n<p>And that's it! Please enjoy my game and feel free to leave criticism for how I can improve in the comments and if there are any bugs.
