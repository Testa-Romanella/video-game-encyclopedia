As the player moves from room to room and interacts with their environment, they begin to discover what is haunting them.</p>\n<p>This demo was one of the first two projects I created in Unity Engine and was completed with a very short turn around.\u00a0 The game was programmed using Unity\u2019s native C# language, and the rooms of the home were hand-illustrated in black marker and then brought into Photoshop to edit values/curves and add vignettes. The demo takes roughly 15 minutes to complete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a full-scale game, the house and narration would be expanded upon, and more gameplay elements would be introduced, possibly including puzzles, player choice, and\u00a0a\u00a0branching storyline.</p>\n<p>This demo's story is based on my own short horror story of the same name.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af6/af6f14c8dbdf10d98e3bb962e008b857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vickilynn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
