Crewmates will work together to complete tasks around the map to win, but make sure to stay alert! Betrayers among the crew will sneak around to cause disruptions and eliminate your fellow crewmates.<br/><br/>Between rounds, you and your teammates will discuss who could be the betrayer. Did you see anything suspicious? Did you see someone sneaking around your eliminated crewmate? After discussing together, you will get to vote on who you think is betraying the crew. Warning: if you guess wrong and vote out an innocent crewmate, the betrayers will be even closer to winning!<br/><br/>MULTIPLE FUN ROLES<br/><br/>- Crewmates: to win, crewmates must complete all of their tasks and / or work together to discover and vote out the betrayer!<br/>- Betrayers: if you\u2019re a betrayer your goal is to eliminate crewmates and cause disruptions to their tasks!<br/>- Sheriff: a sheriff\u2019s job is to protect your fellow crewmates.
