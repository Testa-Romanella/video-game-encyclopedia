And well, they have to escape the facility...</p>\n<p>3Punch is a platformer fighting game, where you need to dodge two attacks to do an attack (Third time's a charm right?). If you dodge for the third time, well you're back at the start (until you will dodge again 2 times). It was made for Game Off 2022 jam. It's my first game that I've made in my life and I hope you will enjoy it :3</p>\n<p><strong>KEYBOARD CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>W/Up arrow - Jump</p>\n<p>AD/Left and right arrow - move horizontally</p>\n<p>S - Duck</p>\n<p>E - Roll</p>\n<p>Q - Dash</p>\n<p>1,\u00a0 2, 3 - Special ability</p>\n<p>Left Click - Attack</p>\n<p>Right Click - Parry</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPAD CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left Joystick - move horizontally</p>\n<p>X (PS) / A (Xbox) / B (Nintendo) - Jump</p>\n<p>Down Button - Duck</p>\n<p>R1 - Roll</p>\n<p>L1 - Dash</p>\n<p>Square, Circle, Triangle (PS) / X,Y,B (Xbox) / Y, X, A (Nintendo) - Special Ability</p>\n<p>L2 - Parry</p>\n<p>R2 - Attack</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>This game\u00a0<em>may</em> have some bugs, so if you find one, you can fix it on GitHub.\u00a0Do it here!<br/></p>\n\n<p>xoxo Ovie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T08:13:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29de22610abcd34a11e036115f65e53c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OvieDev"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
