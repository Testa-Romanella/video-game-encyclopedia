If you have enough fuel, you can stay suspended longer. If you have less fuel, you can jump more because it weighs less. If you hit a tree, get back to shop and lose a few coins or restart and reset your fuel. <br/>You don't lose your record you made in that attempt if you chose to go to shop. You will lose it however (not all of it only last attempt) if you choose restarting. Make it to 20 km's if you can!</p>\n<p><em>Sprites (except player), music and sound are made by myself.<br/></em></p><p>https://liluo.io/instant-builds/41a3da9c-21c7-43b3-9985-8650f02b84fa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T06:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc7/fc7bdb7ff2a4314a5b612d246be9e9d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MideKoruyucu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
