It was my take on the auto-battler genre featuring collectible monsters, tactical gameplay, and emergent strategies.</p>\n<p>Delve deep into the heart of the beast capturing monsters and building the ultimate team. Combine their powers in new and exciting ways, and build a strategy powerful enough to destroy the Monster Vault once and for all!</p>\n<p>Developed with the LOVE game framework (https://love2d.org/)<br/></p>\n<p>The 0.2.0 version looks the nicest and has the most features, but it's buggy. The 0.1.3a version is older but more stable.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Marshall Cannon - Game Design and Code (https://twitter.com/marshall_cannon)<br/></p>\n<p>Keaton Clark - Pixel Art (The good stuff, placeholder art is from a pokemon fan game) (https://twitter.com/PixelKeats)<br/></p>\n<p>Nikolas Santiago - Music and Sound Design (https://niksantiago.bandcamp.com/)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T12:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8eae314e03e5be117e0310ea2dd87789.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marshall Cannon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
