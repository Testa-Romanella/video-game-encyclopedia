It wants this poor knight, and it sure as hell isn\u2019t interested in anyone else. He doesn\u2019t really know why this tornado is so obsessed with him, but he knows if he stops running, he is not going to have a great time.<br/><br/>The thing is, he\u2019s a bit caught up by panic. Unable to take any decision, he just runs straight forward and doesn\u2019t know what he is supposed to do to escape the mighty tornado.<br/><br/>Fortunately, his guardian angel (you) is here to enlighten his path. With a simple <strong>drag-&amp;-drop </strong>motion, help this poor knight to escape the windy monstrosity.</p>\n<p><strong>CODING BLOCKS GAME JAM '22:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game was developed during the Coding Blocks Game Jam '22, with the theme \"It's following me\".
