More unstable elements fill the entire map! But that doesn't mean you can only win by luck, your strategy will be the key to winning the trophy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore strange grid effects, and they will trigger in a chain. This means that sometimes the situation will be too complicated to predict, trust your intuition, or calmly analyze and win? It's all up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEvery character is unique - they all have different abilities, and using them wisely can help you stand out from other players' teams!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the game progresses, you can unlock more characters and different map contents. Expand your collection, and grow your team. Can you collect all the characters?
