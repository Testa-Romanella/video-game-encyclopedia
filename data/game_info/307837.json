Planetary Drift is a racing combat game. The storyline will focus on gathering energy to hold entropy at bay, and is inspired by classic and indie racers. There will be a campaign with at least 10 maps, upgrades, and an endless mode that finds you racing through procedurally-generated courses. Your highest scores for each map are saved to your machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left/Right = Turn. Turn for over a second to get a speed and handling bonus that lasts the rest of the course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Up = Contextual</p>\n<p>Down = Contextual</p>\n<p>Enter = Pause, start, continue if you're dead.</p>\n\n<p>Touch the left side of the screen to turn left. Touch the right side to turn right. Touch both to brake.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T05:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/90337275e69af4461bce45f2ebb1c978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["donstathemonsta"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
