WASD to move, Space to jump, and C to crouch/slide. it has a small basic map and will be updated. It will eventually hopefully become a 3d platformer if all turns out well. Have fun playing! I also made a website for it and heres the link:\u00a0https://sites.google.com/view/theadventuresofbean.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:59:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8faf35af4ee318ef97f3f4b924ddc108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["An0nym0us Amethyst"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
