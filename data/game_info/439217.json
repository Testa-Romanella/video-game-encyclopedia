The theme was 'Pack'.</p>\n<p>In this game you are Agent Pack-Man, a secret agent who delivers 'packages' for the government. Since the theme is mostly covered by the narratives and only to a small part by the gameplay, I hope that the theme is not interpreted too vaguely.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I am quite satisfied with the end product.<br/>Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f81faaa7524b0664d083c7dcdb9344d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DonPasquale"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
