{"id": 980218, "slug": "aiyana", "name": "Aiyana", "name_original": "Aiyana", "description": "Aiyana is a beautiful yet deadly alien world. During the day the world is peaceful, except for the occasional carnivore. At night the planet comes to life and its everyone for themselves. A corruption is spreading through the world and each night it takes a hold of the plants and animals, making them deadlier than ever. <br/><br/>Aiyana aims to be an evolution of the voxel builder genre by giving players challenges and clear goals of progression when playing.<br/><br/>In order to survive the aggressive nightlife Aiyana features more complex fighting mechanics through its spell system. Spells can be unlocked by completing achievements and spending perk points which once unlocked you can quickly swap between up to 12 of them at once. <br/><br/>For those who are feeling more creative we have built a blueprint and structure builder system. How it works is you stake out an area of land and fill it with your structure. Once you're done you can effectively copy and paste the structure into the world as many times as you like, provided you have enough resources.<br/><br/>Here is a house being built using the system:<br/><br/> <br/><br/>To keep a long term save compelling, Aiyana uses an infinite level up system so that your character is always improving the longer you play. The foundation of this is fairly standard were using a stat will level it up. Use enough stamina and it will increase your stamina bar. Taking enough damage will eventually increase your health. <br/><br/>There is no cap to how much you can level up each stat, however the more you level up a stat the harder it will become to continue improving it. <br/><br/>This system is applied globally so that every action is affected including every spell you cast and things like your mining or chopping speed.<br/><br/>While staying in a long term save is great, sometimes you also just want to start over and feel the struggle from the beginning again. With our anti-wiki feature each save file you start will be different. Rather than looking up the best food to eat or which monster drops give the best potions, you will have to experiment in each save file to find the answer. A lot of these options are randomized so each new world will be different from the last.<br/><br/>For example, in one world eating a burger might increase your max health, in another it might improve your mining speed.<br/><br/>Our aim with this mechanic is to make the game play less clinical and encourage you to play and experiment more with your world. We love this idea but appreciate it might not be for everyone. We will closely listen to feedback and may include a setting to disable it if we feel its needed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T07:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b168dd1c4a82f37524caca44d96c5aac.jpg", "website": "http://www.LaireonGames.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laireon Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Laireon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
