There's a\u00a0<em>problem</em>\u00a0though, because your mom\u00a0<em>keeps walking</em>\u00a0around the damn house and sometimes\u00a0<em>checks on you</em>.</p>\n<p>As soon as you hear\u00a0<em>footsteps</em>\u00a0approaching your door, you gotta\u00a0<em>zip your pants</em>\u00a0and<em>\u00a0switch the tab</em>. Otherwise, your mom will send you into oblivion. Obviously, she forgets to lock\u00a0<em>the door</em>after checking so you have to get up and do it yourself.</p>\n<p>It gets even harder. If you do it too fast, you will start\u00a0<em>hyperventilating</em>\u00a0and that can alert her, so don't expect just to mash the buttons and win.</p>\n<p>Everyone went through this, right?</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>A / D - Look around</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>Mouse Buttons / Input Settings - Move hand</p>\n<p>Esc - Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/925b963f6af4ec7e0d908dce3afe028a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrCiastku"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
