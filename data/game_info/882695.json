Problem is, something evil is wiping them out. OG's are mostly out fighting other battles, which leaves you and a select few others to band together to shut off the problematic gates and\u00a0get the main portal back online. You start by making a choice: \"Can't Stop\" or \"Won't Stop\" which will position you differently to begin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From there it's up to you to explore and progress through three Portal jumps: Candy Land, Wild West, and Alien Planet. Shops and Inns will help you recharge. and of course, chests may be found scattered throughout the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore, enjoy the world, and work towards conquering the game (which may take a bit of strategy and learning).\u00a0</p>\n<p>How I made this game:</p>\n<p>I used a game manager to help make this game from the Unity Store. It was helpful in providing some starter logic and provided me with demos and example scripts to get started. I then could piece through them, eliminate what I realistically couldn't use now (like quests and missions) and keep the stuff that I could copy and heavily reconfigure to make the game different (like battles and enemies)</p>\n<p>On 11/14 I made a call out to the MetaBoy discord community to get some volunteers to put in game. Special thanks to ChicoMoe, ThugLife27, Shotty, Probert and Adam for volunteering to be used in game, be sure to seek them out (they may give you good rewards)</p>\n<p>Music: 100% Spaceman. Some tracks were made before game jam and some tracks were custom made during the game jam.</p>\n<p>Art: About 50/50. An RPG kit helped with things like grass borders etc. However, all MetaBoy assets were draw up during the game jam. Examples of custom art include, the Metaboy zones, the NPC art. Examples of art I used with license include water, grass, etc. Some licensed art was also recolored and brought back into the game, such as the buildings, to match the MetaBoy world.\u00a0<br/><br/>Hands on throughout process with C# script editing and bug fixing, music composition using MIDI, and pixel art generation.</p>\n<p>Platforms/Services Used:<br/><br/>Art/Design:<br/>**PiskelApp.com: Most 2d art sprites (First time using)<br/>Canva.com: Title Screen</p>\n<p>Sound/ Composition:<br/>SoundTrap<br/>NoteFlight</p>\n<p>Game Design:<br/>**Unity (first time using to make a 2d project)</p>\n<p>https://github.com/spacemanfromdiscord/Spaceman-GameJam<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de16eb8167c8e72ce966eb761b629cc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spaceman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
