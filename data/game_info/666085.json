The theme of this jam was \"Birthday\".</p>\n<p>The idea of this game is that you raise little creatures known as \"BirthdayGotchi\" and remember their birthday and what they want for it.</p>\n<p>You can drag and drop food on the BirthdayGotchi to feed them, drag and drop a ball on them to play with them, drag and drop them into a shower to clean them and drag and drop them into bed to let them sleep. They'll leave behind eggs when they're happy, which you sell for money. Buy more food and balls in the shop and buy them the present they want.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41faa186f3bae7d939d81c8e42d8f0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sighet_someone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
