Your boat slips out over the waves, the shore receding behind you. Eventually you stop--here is as good a place as any. Quietly, you raise your fishing rod and prepare to cast off. Your tools lay nearby, ready for anything, or so you hope. You are never sure what you will catch out here.</p>\n<p>Fish'tahgn is a lovecraftian fishing game about unknown horrors, teeth in the darkness, and risking it all for the biggest and strangest catch anyone has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for OrcaJam 2016 and Fishing Jam 2.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Programming - D.
