The current king has fallen deathly ill, but has yet to name an heir to the throne. His son would make an excellent king during a time of war, but his lust for power would likely lead to the ruination of the kingdom. His daughter would be a Queen beloved by the people, but she hates him and wants nothing to do with the royal family. Desperate for a successor the king sends his children off to learn the four schools of magic, hoping that the journey would mellow out his son or bring his daughter peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A linear story with multiple \"semi- open world\" segments to provide a more unique play through.
