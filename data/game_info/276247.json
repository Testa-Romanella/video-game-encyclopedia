As they search for their papers they notice something strange is going on around campus. Aliens have invaded the campus and are gathering objects for unknown reasons. It's up to you and your buddy to stop the alien threat and recover all that was stolen.\u00a0 Players will have to survive through waves of aliens using the best weapon at their disposal, typing.
