You just have to open it, and it will feel like a game made in a proper engine! (you can close the game anytime by pressing the escape key)</p>\n<p>The .pptx is the raw powerpoint file, in wich you can edit and take a look behind the scenes on how this thing was done (It isn't very organized, I know)</p>\n<p>Also, rate the game.</p>\n\n<p>Confused on how to play the game?<br/>Got bugs to report?</p>\n<p>send a tweet to me @kuerbiskosar, or @ me on the powerpoint game jam discord!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f57ccdf2ede57e776f8627617b44b418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuerbiskosar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
