{"id": 471823, "slug": "town-developer", "name": "Town Developer", "name_original": "Town Developer", "description": "<p><strong>Town Developer</strong> is a puzzle game with tower defense mechanics. <em>Look as those cities on the verge of environmental collapse!</em> Only your smarts can keep them running.</p>\n<p>Plan urban environment and allow necessary traffic to reach goals while keeping your impact at the minimum. Be clever and at times be quick, by utilizing the free space for your buildings and ordering waves of vehicles.</p>\n<p>This games was designed and completed in two weeks as an experiment on the idea of a TD game where instead of killing blobs you try to save them and influence them before they reach the base. Started as a prototype, it now features <strong>14 levels</strong> with challenging scenarios that constantly introduce new elements to the playing field.</p>\n<p><strong>Town Developer</strong> is provided <strong>as is</strong> and <strong>free</strong> of charge. Any reported issues with the game running or being badly balanced will be addressed. However, as an experiment, there are no current plans to continue developing it. If you wish to support development of this and other games made by me, I would appreciate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:12:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f71207222abcfaeb57681a2a0890edbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["pycbouh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
