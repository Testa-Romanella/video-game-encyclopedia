You play as Mico, a  young mushroom sprite, as your world is in the midst of a magical surge.  It's your job to gather magical nutrients - Mycos - and use them to  sprout magical glowing mushrooms! Glowing garden is meant to be a  mindful, relaxation experience. There is no end goal but to grow a  garden of mushrooms.\u00a0\r\n    </p>\r\nGameplay Changes v1.0 -&gt; v1.0.1\r\n<p>Glowing Garden was formerly developed for PC's in mind, however in light of recent playtests it was decided to shift from PC to Mobile instead. Mico can still dig underground, jump around, and grow mushrooms like in the previous iteration, however UI elements and mushroom growth and thereby crafting are being experimented on. Some features may not work as intended, i.e. mushroom crafting in this iteration is still the same old system.<strong> Please try this out on your mobile device.</strong><br/></p>\n<br/>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Further releases of <strong>Glowing Garden</strong> are intended for mobile. <br/></p>\n<p>Finger - Movement</p>\n<p>Finger Flick up w/ Char at center - Jump</p>\n<p>Finger Slide up w/ Bottom Screen - Pull up Encyclopedia</p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Jacques Visser - Programming, Design<br/></p>\n<p>Jihong 'Yuuki' Min - Art, Design</p>\n<p>Jose Antonio Juarez - Score<br/></p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T08:30:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b4690143e4cbc1a63525e6e967c7ccfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Active Duck Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
