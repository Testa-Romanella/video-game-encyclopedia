Unfortunately, the best intel you've received about the location of your ships were from carrier pigeons, who can only carry three 5x5 grids at a time. What's worse, is that they've messed up the rotation, and also you have one piece of intel meant for your opponent! Can you riddle out what intel is true and what intel is fake before your opponent does and wipes you off the map?<br/><br/>Thrilling hotseat gameplay. Simply change who's looking at the computer when the popup shows. Happy bombing!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T23:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e5143e216a21740e33870a40fe97a02f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tetra"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
