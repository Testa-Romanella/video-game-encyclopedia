{"id": 779847, "slug": "blow-fly", "name": "Blow & Fly", "name_original": "Blow & Fly", "description": "Blow &amp; Fly is a physics-based puzzle game in which you move and aim at the same time. Your owner's naughty son destroyed your aquarium, and now you're desperately in need of water! Use what little liquid is left on the floor to move around and retreat to a toilet bowl which might save your life, or... Flush you down into far more challenging realms, escaping which will require all of your agility and creativity!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are two ways to traverse the levels in Blow &amp; Fly: rolling along the floor and blowing water out of your mouth, thus launching yourself in the opposite direction. Every time you hit the floor, you regain a small amount of liquid, just enough to get yourself into the air again. Utilize this ability to avoid hazards such as pitfalls or spikes, and make good use of the jump pads, gravity switches, keys and water drops to reach the safe haven with water.<br/><br/>If you wish to survive, you will need to master your abilities: for each obstacle you pass, there will be a greater challenge ahead!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u2022 Accessible Controls: the game's simple \"move &amp; aim\" controls are intuitive and easy to grasp for players of all skill levels.<br/>\u2022 Over 70 Levels to Conquer: challenge your fish launching skills with over 70 puzzles of gradually increasing difficulty across 3 different environments.<br/>\u2022 Discover Secrets: find hidden locations to reveal secret areas and new levels which turn the game's mechanics on their head.<br/>\u2022 Unlock new Playable Fish: those who take on the extra challenges will be rewarded with new visuals for their in-game character.<br/>\u2022 Collect all the Pearls: complete levels within a certain number of launches to be awarded a pearl. Can you obtain all of them?<br/>\u2022 Something for Everyone: Blow &amp; Fly has something for everyone, including speedrunners, achievement hunters and completionists.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T06:02:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/903e323c45d821abd7d44c10db80a6fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Khud0"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Khud0"], "esrb_rating": null}
