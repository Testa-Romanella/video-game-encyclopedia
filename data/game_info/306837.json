May also contain some flashing lights moments!!</strong></p>\n<p>Tem here!!!\u00a0It's my first time making an RPGmaker game!! Its my first time trying to put together my own project outside of an animated thing (though... I guess this is still sort of.. that..).\u00a0 I've always wanted to make an RPGMaker game, though I guess it isn't much of a game. Its around 15-20 minutes long (though I guess it could be longer if you try to get all the endings).\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>There's around 4 different endings you can get.\u00a0<br/><br/>A\u00a0small warning that one of the endings is a little creepy/unsettling.. But hopefully its not too much.\u00a0 <strong>Also... occasionally a movie might freeze... I'm not really sure what causes this, if it happens, try restarting the game. I'm sorry if this happens :(</strong><br/><br/>Thank you for stopping by!! I hope you like it!! I'll try to make more one day.\u00a0<br/>Hopefully I set up the downloading option right where you don't have to pay for it. But feel free to donate if you'd like to support me!!\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story,\u00a0Illustration,\u00a0Pixel Art, Cutscene/Pixel\u00a0A</strong><strong>nimation</strong><strong>\u00a0by:</strong><br/><strong>Temmie Chang</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music by:</strong><br/><strong>Toby Fox\u00a0</strong>- in-game music<br/><strong>James Roach</strong>\u00a0- TV-scene animation songs <br/><br/><strong>Sound Design:</strong><br/><strong>fatbard\u00a0</strong>- (story) cutscene animation sound design<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:\u00a0</strong><br/><strong>Archeia</strong> - a lot of help with learning RPGMaker/helping solve problems/pluggin/font help\u00a0<br/><strong>Yanfly</strong> - use of MessageCore and CoreEngine pluggins<br/><strong>Stephen Lavelle</strong>\u00a0- use of bfxr (sound effects program I used to make in-game sounds)<br/><strong>SumRndmDde</strong>- I wanted to mention them because their youtube tutorial/learning series was incredibly helpful and made the program less intimidating to explore, learn and use</p>\n<br/><br/>If for any reason your anti-virus gets upset at the normal version of the game, I included a more aesthetically default (RPGMaker icon) version available to download as well.\u00a0\r\n<p>*Regarding MAC version:\u00a0<br/>I'm running into issues with fixing some bugs and errors with MAC for some reason, so hopefully I'll be able to release that version at a later date.
