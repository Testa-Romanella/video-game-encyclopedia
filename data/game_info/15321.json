This game is for you.</strong><br/><br/>Tear the #!@$ out of a mountain-top village as the King sends out his royal army to try to stop you and protect his kingdom. The more villagers you devour, the stronger you get. Fill your belly and enter Rampage Mode where you can unleash mass destruction!<br/><br/>Devour enough villagers to fill your Egg Meter and you'll lay eggs that hatch baby dragons to help you tear it up and keep your destruction combo going. Terrorize the village enough and the royal family themselves will come out to rally their troops with buffs!<br/><br/><ul><li>Steam Trading Cards<br/></li><li>Steam Achievements<br/></li><li>Steam Leaderboard Support<br/></li><li>Development Blog showing the game go from programmer-art rectangles to this<br/></li><li>Gamepad support<br/></li><li>Want to do a Let's Play, stream, review, etc?
