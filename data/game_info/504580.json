Pile after pile, once summoned by our hard working cast, awaits your impeccable command over the valves in order to finally reach the abyss of redemption.<br/>Beware of rusty old handles that may not turn in the desired direction, but even more so of worn-out ones that turn on their own. Avoid collision! For if occurring in the wrong place, it may oblige you to shamefully resign and start over. Strategically create closed loops if necessary.</p>\n<p>Design &amp; spriting: Steffen Fuchslocher<br/>Programming: Steffen L\u00f6rch<br/>Music &amp; sounds: Dominik Schubert</p>\n<p>(c) 2020 Merrow0</p>\n<p>&gt; Poop Loop<br/>&gt; Stuck on a loo<br/>&gt; Don't loop the poop<br/>&gt; Dung Commander</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/733f910809a3d38946efa6c3163936f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["merrow0"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
