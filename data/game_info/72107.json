Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. <br/><br/>Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? <br/>Answer: When saved games can\u2019t be automatically restored, we\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter \u201eCatanWarp*\u201c (* = 1\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. <br/><br/>Question: Are dice rolls really random? <br/>Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! <br/><br/>*****<br/>Questions or suggestions for improvements: <br/>Mail to ios@usm.de <br/>We are looking forward to your feedback! <br/><br/>For more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com <br/>or visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News <br/><br/>*****", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T18:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6bfa0ac7242183f86b736fee4f1a4b3.jpg", "website": "http://www.usmgames.com/content-100-100/apps/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["USM"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["United Soft Media Verlag"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
