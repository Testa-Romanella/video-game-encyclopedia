However, once Aeli vanished hostile gods, and evil creatures invaded the planet. The player takes the role of one of the Immortals, lesser gods that serve to protect Aelion and must defeat all kinds of threats that endanger the planet. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>After creating a character and choosing one of 13 classes, the player starts their adventure in the capital of Aelion where after finishing tutorial, they get their first Combat Missions. Structurally, the game is very reminiscent of other MMO RPGs. The game focuses on upgrading your character, completing numerous missions, exploring the world and interacting with other players. However, several major differences in gameplay and player progression make Skyforge very distinct from other games in the genre. <br />\nThe combat system is a mix between action and traditional MMO RPG skill-based system. Each class has its unique set of moves and abilities, some of which can be chained in different combos, in the hack-and-slash game fashion. The player can also change their character\u2019s class at any time just by selecting it from the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-16T08:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d88e99f82c7133027e682fd87cd9e12.jpg", "website": "https://sf.my.com/", "rating": 2.54, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 1359, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 189, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 403, "ratings_count": 245, "suggestions_count": 665, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 246, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Allods Team"], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["My.Com"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
