Become a Planetary Architect of the Cat's mega-corp, Nekokami Co., and create beautiful, cozy planets in every corner of the galaxies. Did I mention that you will need to pay your respects to the Kami, the spirits of nature present on every planet? <br/><br/><br/>In this sneak peek of the full game, you will: <br/><br/><ul><li>Create beautiful worlds of natural habitats and human settlements with strategic, or spontaneous, placement of tiles in a unique hand-drawn-like art style. <br/></li><li>Follow the beginning of a wholesome story of Human-Cat friendship, set millennia later in the future. <br/></li><li>Earn your place in Nekokami Co. by creating worlds that beat expectations, or satisfy your creative urge by following your own desires. Your Cat bosses are laid back and forgiving. They are Cats after all. <br/></li><li>Befriend a selection of Kami, spirits of the nature and the universe, and see them bring miracles (or hilarious hiccups) to your work.  </li></ul><h3>Link to Full Game - Wishlist &amp; Follow to get notified of development updates!</h3>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840890<br/><br/><br/>Nekokami Co. is commissioned to manage planets all over the universe. That's a LOT of planets! Environment, biomes and rules differ from Star System to Star System. You will get to visit at least SIX Star Systems during your internship.<br/><br/>I did mention the Kami*, right? Technically the spirits are the real fellows creating the worlds. As a Planetary Architect, you are basically borrowing their Creative Energy for your own use. You will need to seek their acceptance and approval. Through their friendship, you will potentially learn the secrets of nature and the arcane laws of universe. Maybe some day you will be able to wield godly powers?<br/><br/><br/>*Kami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to \"spirits and gods\".<br/><br/><strong>Developer's Note </strong><br/>This game is created by a pair of nomad developers currently living in Japan. <br/><br/>While the game may remind you of some famous world builders like Dorfromantik and Townscaper, our Cats, Humans and Kami have put forth their best efforts to provide you a unique gameplay experience. :) We greatly appreciate your feedback to the game in the Steam forums.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T09:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be587a1ba8fbb15e55435e667f4a61b9.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/rocketinbottle", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rocket-in-Bottle"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rocket-in-Bottle"], "esrb_rating": null}
