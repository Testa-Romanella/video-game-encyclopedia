There \n      is no weapon powerful enough to destroy or even divert it from its \n      Earth-bound trajectory. Only an amount of energy greater than what our \n      sun produces could prevent it. That magnitude of energy is located \n      outside of our solar system, at the 4 cardinal points of the galaxy. At \n      those coordinates are the planets: Upsil-on, Magnet-on, Fusi-on and \n      Dark-on. Visit each planet to collect the greatest amount of energy and \n      the mission will be a complete success. Humanity will die out some day, \n      but not this time!\n    </p><p>\n      Be brave!
