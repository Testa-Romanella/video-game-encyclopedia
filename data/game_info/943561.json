Off The Tracks - a chaotic physics-based first person platformer.<br/><br/>Make your way through each level competing with obstacles of varying and increasing difficulty, and if that doesn't sound difficult enough, you're on top of a terribly driven train carriage at high speed where the floor is lava, metaphorically.<h3>Features</h3><strong>30 levels, 5 worlds.</strong><br/>Make your way through 30 individual levels on the top of poorly driven high-speed train carriages, what could go wrong, right?<br/><br/><strong>Physics-based fun.</strong><br/>There is no such thing as physics bugs, and physics-based unpredictability only adds to the fun.<br/><br/><strong>Full Controller Support.</strong><br/>Play in a way that suits you. Off The Tracks has full controller support and the ability to switch between mouse/keyboard and controller on the fly.<br/><br/><strong>Global Leaderboards.</strong><br/>Each individual level has a high-score based global leaderboard to top. Remember, it's not just about being fast, you collect style points throughout the course of each level which contribute to your overall score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T03:09:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7afa787d80d8d66d09381f8616045af1.jpg", "website": "https://www.loneminded.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loneminded"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Loneminded"], "esrb_rating": null}
