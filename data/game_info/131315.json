You play as an unnamed protagonist continuously running to the right because...well...of some medical condition. Sure, let's go with that. Jump over pits, dodge the spikes, you know the deal.</p><p>The game consists of three levels (including a boss battle), a main menu and statistics page, and even a level select screen (fancy, right!). Each level is hand-crafted to make you hate the level designer...I'm not joking.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Three levels</li><li>Stats</li><li>Easter eggs</li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>[Space] - Jump</p><p>[Mouse] - Menus</p><p>[Shift] - Toggle fullscreen</p><p><strong>A Game a Week [Week 0]:</strong><br/></p><p>This game is my warm-up for \"a game a week\" (hence the week 0) Every week, I will force myself to make and release a (terrible) game.
