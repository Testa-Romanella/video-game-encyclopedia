{"id": 53762, "slug": "contra-1987", "name": "Contra (1987)", "name_original": "Contra (1987)", "description": "<p>The Famicom/NES versions of Contra are an expanded port of the arcade version, developed in-house. The biggest difference is that the levels are restructured and significantly longer, with stages 5 through 8 being derived from and expanded from areas in the arcade version&#39;s final stage. The plot is altered as well, being set in the year 1987 in the Amazon, rather than 2633 in the Galuga archipelago. Weapons are slightly different in function and frequency, and the Konami Code makes a famous appearance. The Famicom version has additional graphical effects and between-mission cut-scenes not seen in the NES version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T07:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/157/15798bc849e48bd45459b48efc33efae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.31, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 145, "beaten": 275, "toplay": 27, "dropped": 133, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 312, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 315, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
