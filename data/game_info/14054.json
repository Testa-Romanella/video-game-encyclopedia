{"id": 14054, "slug": "sticker-craft", "name": "Sticker Craft", "name_original": "Sticker Craft", "description": "Sticker Craft - game about combining stickers and collecting them. <br/><br/>For example, combine stickers \"Water\" and \"Lake\" and get \"Sea\" sticker. Combine \"Sea\" to get \"Ocean\". Continue those logical sequences to discover all 210+ stickers. <br/><br/>Most of them can be crafted using combinations with other stickers, but some of them - only by Stickerizing [Wild] Stickers. That's unique feature of the game. <br/><br/>[Wild] Stickers appear only when some requirements are met. For example - play at night(real night) and wait for [Wild] Moon sticker to appear. Or place few Grass sticker to [Wild] Sheep sticker to appear. After that you need to tame them by combining them with special sticker called Stickerizer. This will create normal sticker and of course increase you discovered sticker number. But not all [Wild] elements are so easy to find.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff041a6ad26453e203459c3b0ad3782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 53, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One More Game"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["One More Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
