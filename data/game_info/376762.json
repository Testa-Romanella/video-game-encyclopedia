The sun's rays blast Mother Earth with <strong>radiation </strong>and <strong>infinite heat</strong>, mutating and destroying all life that is slow moving and unable to escape. Humanity only <strong>clings </strong>to existence, mostly having been turned into sun burnt, hyper-aggressive freaks.<br/></p>\n<p>You are <strong>The Recycler</strong>, a remnant from the <strong>once </strong>great species, now reduced to a <strong>violent </strong>desert scavenger whom lives in <strong>perpetual night</strong>. Utilize weapons and vehicles from a bygone era in order to stay on the move, out of reach of the <strong>unforgiving</strong> star.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Evan Rabdau</li><li>Isaac Smith</li><li>Joseph Moyle</li><li>Kenneth Pangilinan</li><li>Ryan Stonecipher</li><li>Scott Hoge</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd9a6a720503024be554a7258518b8f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Major Flex"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
