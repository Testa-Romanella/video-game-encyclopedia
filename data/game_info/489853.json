Throughout the playthrough, players will have to opportunity to edit, upgrade and interact with various elements of their characters, including their abilities and equipment. Before missions, the player may customise the weapons their characters are using, upgrade their abilities using points earned on the field and then interact with their characters as part of the mission briefing. During this briefing, the player will discuss the upcoming mission and decide which character they wish to play as.</p>\n\n<p>During missions, the player assumes control of their character. Played in a 3rd person perspective, the player is able to view the characters created and witness the brutal combat more clearly. In the experience are 60 weapons, which all have unique characteristics, such as recoil, reload speed, rate of fire and ammunition capacity.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For References to all Assets used in this project, as well as the opportunity to see my development blog and the progression of this experience, please visit my blog:\u00a0https://maforshaw.blogspot.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c9a91b8278d6be74d00261eaeea28aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MForshaw"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
