It was said that the civilization that made the graveyard enchanted it so that it\u00a0would resurrect all those who were buried\u00a0in it. However, to keep them and rest of the world safe\u00a0they created a barrier along with it which would trap all of those who entered it, never allowing\u00a0\u00a0them to leave. Unfortunately for you, with no knowledge that the graveyard is enchanted with a\u00a0barrier and that the zombies chasing you always come back to life, you will desperately try to\u00a0fight for your life armed with nothing but a machine pistol, some med kits\u00a0and high caliber bullets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c32852a7595715d9bfd5ca43ce816bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["monkeychipz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
