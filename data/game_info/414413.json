As of release, only 10 levels (and a free play stage)\u00a0are currently in the game, but more levels will be added soon! This game was created for the 3rd official Brackeys Game Jam. Have fun, I hope you enjoy!</p><p>Brackeys if you see this please make a tutorial on a sensitivity slider that stays the same throughout scenes. I ended up figuring it out after the jam was over, but that took me over 2 hours. thx :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:42:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49d806471a1822cae76a244ca85d289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noha"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
