You can find it on google play by clicking on this link\u00a0\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rawrstudio.riddleclicker\u00a0</p>\n<p>or by clicking on one of the images below!</p>\n<p><strong>Game is in beta.</strong>\u00a0<strong>What that means?</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nIt means that there is still lots of work to do, but I hope I can make it come true with you!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Is the game being updated at least?</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nYes, it is! I update the game daily, providing at least one new level a day! Each week I am trying to add new features to the game, such as new gambling methods, or new elements, like shop, settings etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project:</strong></p>\n<p>In Riddle Clicker, you click to get coins, which you can spend on either new levels or gambling! Updates are every day, in which I always make at least one new level! Although of the big popularity of clicker games, and a vast collection of them, I decided to make my own. Through the entire history of Google Play, I've never stood upon a game, that was a clicker and had riddles instead of normal shop. After short period of time, I decided to take my thoughts out of my brain, and put it inside the game. Creation of this game took a lot of time, because the whole project is made by me. It is also worth to mention, that the game is my first ever created, so I had to put 110% into making it. Daily I spend lots of time on creating the game, but also playing, and enjoying it. You should also try it out! \u00a0</p>\n\r\nSmarthpone designed by Freepik\r\n\n<p>Above, you can see the clicking scene, which is almost the most important thing in the game. You click using you finger (you can use as many fingers as you want). Randomly, between a minute and more than five-six minutes, a coin will pop up, which upon clicking on it, gives random amount of coins!\u00a0<strong>P/C</strong>\u00a0is your clicking power, you can upgrade it by\u00a0<strong>completing levels</strong>! \u00a0</p>\n\r\nSmarthpone designed by Freepik\r\n\n<p>Each day there is one new level. I will be doing it until I run out of puzzles, but for now, I have lots of ideas for them! Of course, each level gives something in return, i.e. every single one of them, gives P/C! Depend on level difficulty, there are different amounts of P/C that you will get. Also, in order to get that level, you need to have coins, that's why clicking is important, but not the most important. Mostly, focus on completing the levels, they give you P/C which makes the prize in Wheel Of Fortune greater! It is probably the time, to show you at least one level! \u00a0</p>\n\r\nSmarthpone designed by Freepik\r\n\n<p>Above, you can see one of many riddles. In this particular one, you need to type something in, but my riddles aren't always about typing. In some of them, you need to move something around, try to put it into different places, sometimes you also have to use google to search up possible answer! Many, many options of solving the riddle, educating yourself in a way, and having fun at the same time! If you run out of riddles, you can go and try your luck! \u00a0</p>\n\r\nSmarthpone designed by Freepik\r\n\n<p>You can either try your luck on\u00a0<strong>roulette</strong>, or\u00a0<strong>wheel of fortune</strong>\u00a0(I prefer roulette)! Everything that you see, was made by me, every script and every graphics (maybe not the coin or the smartphone vector but you get the idea). In roulette, obviously, you try to hit the colour by betting on it! I have lost many coins on roulette so far, so use your head and do it wisely!\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>That's the end for now! I hope I somehow encouraged you to download, review or at least spread the word about my game. If you do so, stay tuned every day for new updates, more people come around, more energy I get, which in return, let's me make bigger updates!\u00a0</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>I am thankful for reading this, and I hope, I'll see you in my game!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b88/b8838d2a67bc62c2b194c83389b38950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RAWRStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
