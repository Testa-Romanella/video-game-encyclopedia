These nutrients can be used to feed a starter batch of FBS to grow a human heart! Your first product.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mine impacted asteroids for some quick credits to get you started. Sell your minerals and hearts on the launchpad where you can also buy new equipment and production resources.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You can also buy and place new structures to expand your capacities but watch out for rival corporate mercenaries that try to attack under cover of darkness.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>___________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Maven is our very early prototype of a much larger planned project. We have so much we'd love to see added to the game. I've listed a short series of planned features below. Leave a comment if any of this has interested you :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Planned Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>More organs! The aim for the full game will be to have a significant amount of available products with which you can choose to specialise your production. These also can range in quality of production, when you first start out your available equipment and resources will limit the final quality of your products. Eventually, even items like cybernetics become available to augment your organs with and sell to the highest bidders.</strong></li><li><strong>Automation! The life of a barrel donkey can quickly get boring. With more money comes more automation, connect power and producers to pipes and wires. You can feed these into your base hub and then access them in your labs.</strong></li><li><strong>Dollys/Vehicles. Not generated enough cash yet for automation? There will be a number of intermediate options which makes transiting more resources at once a lot easier.</strong></li><li><strong>Defences (Auto-turrets of varying types, placeable lights, ammo types &amp; ammo production)</strong></li><li><strong>More complex production chains (more base resources, more intermediaries)</strong></li><li><strong>Enemy bases / encampments (Want to steal some resources/products? Or simply get some peace and quiet for a while, head over to your nearest rival corporation production facility and wreak some havoc)</strong></li><li>Player gear &amp; customisation (Better guns, armour, extended oxygen tanks and backpacks)</li><li><strong>Much more!</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e173ec8e8974ff25b3e9b01527a1eed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steel Peak Games", "DjinnGA"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
