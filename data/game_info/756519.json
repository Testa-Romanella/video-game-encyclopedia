{"id": 756519, "slug": "wild-weiners", "name": "Wild Weiners", "name_original": "Wild Weiners", "description": "<p><em>Game Studio: GAMco</em></p>\n<p>Wild Weiners is a early development FPS shooter originally created as a joke, originally it was\u00a0going to be made\u00a0as an innapropriate prototype game to play with friends but realised that something more could be created, something that was a lot more than a simple joke. Currently the game is very early development. The game is still going to be very polygon based, with some humor here and there as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Future for this project is still very undecided. A large quantity of players is not expected, the game is mostly just for friends to try out and play around with every few weeks. The Development is currently moving quite fast, with multiplayer systems already being added. Once the game is somewhat completed, it will be uploaded to itch.io for the public to try. Don't expect this game to be realised soon, it's going to take considerably long before the alpha versions are even released.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Again, please take notice that this game is generally a party game for friends, not expected to gain a playerbase.</p>\n\n<p><em>Contributors (DISCORD):</em></p>\n<ul><li>Edohc#3475 - Level Creation, Programming, Lead Dev (clapped)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>robloxman69#5699 - Music &amp; Sound Effects</li></ul>\n<ul><li>minglemaster#7381 - Art &amp; Sprites</li></ul>\n<p><em>Modelling Team</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Kursuki#5606 - Lead Modelling</li><li>polar#9581 - Model Creator</li></ul>\n<p>Find us on:<br/>YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyu4R9OpnNFlkfK_87P7vjA/featured</p>\n<p>INSTA: (In creation)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T12:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a6fc80f45680b7f813f1aee2d26c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edohc"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
