Team up with a strange cast of characters across a small world map, and take on the evil magician Rick and his warlocks!</p>\n<p>This game offers maybe an hour of story and content depending on how much time you want to spend on it. Featuring 3 dungeons and a final boss, a large cast of characters, two towns, and a strange world full of AI generated creatures and NPCs.</p>\n<p>A large portion of the text, descriptions, and dialogue in the game are generated on GPT-2, as well as other disparate copywriter AI from a myriad other websites. a few lines we have supplemented ourselves and a lot of it has been generally cleaned up while preserving the AI's \"intent\" as far as we are concerned. Much of the dialogue was written on a multi-choice basis, so we always had some control over the direction of conversations and scripts, but all of that input is still given by an AI.</p>\n<p>this is one of our first RPGMaker projects and the combat system is bound to be an unbalanced mess, but we dont particularly care. its funnier that way!</p>\n\n<p>we have no intention of deceiving anyone, this was a very hands on development process and we have picked and chosen many things featured in this game. an AI can't develop a whole RPG!</p>\n<p>thanks for taking interest, and we hope you enjoy! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T09:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb879c24971b6d57344bf3a1a26e298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roxy Robot"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
