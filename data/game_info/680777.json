I have learned so many features about this fascinating game engine and now I have created and built a Tetris-style puzzle game from scratch! I have taken my fundamental knowledge of C# and Unity and risen my skills to a whole new level because of Tetris. To start with a blank project and ended up with a fully working game brings joy to any game developer's face no matter whether they are not experienced or not and for me to learn new techniques to upgrade and enhance my Tetris game, for example, learning more C# scripts skills logically, organising it cleanly and using more mobile skills so I can develop Tetris on a mobile device!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I set up my own project settings and environment; broke down the gameplay mechanics; created a board class to store data (like high-scores, level etc); laid out user interface items; created my shape class; setting up my GameController to handle logic and apply time to it; Using C# to handle the player input; added sound effects and particle effects so I can add more characteristics to make Tetris a well-polished game. The art assets were from Photoshop- this game is aimed at game developers like myself who are familiar or a fan with Tetris. Tetris has improved my skill set as a game developer because I am familiar with Unity and C# as it was necessary to have past experience with Unity or other game engines like Intellj, Unreal Engine, Godot and Phaser to code this game.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0Down Arrow (To speed an object down), Up Arrow (Change an object shape), Left Arrow (Move the object to the left), Right Arrow (Move an object to the right) or Press the Rotate button to move either left or right.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b89e981cf3fa342eb5ebef7a148b55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
