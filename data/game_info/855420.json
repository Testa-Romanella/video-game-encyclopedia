Hope you enjoy and let me know what you think. I'd love to get some feedback.</p>\n<p>This download is a ROM that you can play on an NES emulator.\u00a0The game uses flash saving (for saving your progress) but not all emulators support it. I'd recommend using the latest version of Mesen or FCEU to play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T13:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75d60a15489ecf1e6f0c99eec5c6312.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Industrial Pixels"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
