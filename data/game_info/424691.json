When you wake, you are greeted by screams from the citizens of the tow outside. Something has happened. The Crystal has shattered. You pick out from screams of people running by that a Black Ooze has been released upon the town. You feel a distinct sense of duty to help the townsfolk repair the Crystal and drive the Ooze back to its kaleidoscopic cave. Will you find the shards and repair the damage before the Black Ooze encompasses everything?</p>\n\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours during Global Gam Jam 2020 at Kennesaw State University. It was intended to be a top down puzzle game where you would find crystal shards based on clues given by the villagers to repair the shattered crystal before time ran out and the Black Ooze consumed the village.</p>\n<p>What it ended up being was a 48 hour crash course on Unity Game Dev for Edward and I. We set some lofty goals we couldn't quite reach, but I learned a lot from my first Game Jam, and will try to be a bit more knowledgeable before my next endeavor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e8553c9ac4f63231a64b463cea26e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["noahdnixon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
