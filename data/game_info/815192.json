It's up to you to influence their choices and determine the method through which each loop will disappear.<br/><br/>As you step into the shoes of Kanatsun, Amelie, and Rashmi over the course of nine different timelines, discover the secrets of the characters and the clocktower alike. Push your protagonist into making good choices, and see the loop simply rewind, granting its victims the opportunity to recall the events which transpired... Or dive into poor decisions and watch as Entropy overtakes the loop, leaving you the only one to remember the way the timeline fell apart.<br/><br/>How was this Anomaly formed? Why did these particular people get trapped inside? What is the source of the Entropy, and who is the Enemy? And most of all, how can the Anomaly be escaped?<br/><br/>Morning, Noon, and Night. Kanatsun, Amelie, and Rashmi. Explore the different permutations of this time loop and bear witness to all eighteen endings, and you just might be able to find a path to set free the fourteen individuals trapped inside the Anomalous Clocktower.<h3>\u272d</h3><br/>Entropic Float contains 9 routes, 18 normal endings, and 1 true ending.
