Through CUTE we can find the best of the best together. Simply download the simulation programme and try your best at completing the mission at hand. Our expert agents will contact you if deemed worthy!</p>\n\n<p>Now, we only trust the best of the best with our\u00a0<em>cutting-edge space vessels</em>. This is because their unique movement and weapon systems have still not been deemed safe by the United Nations and may be prone to\u00a0<strong>impromptu combustion</strong>\u00a0at low energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>This is where you come in. Our new\u00a0<strong>J.U.M.P.E.R. C.A.B.L.E.</strong>\u00a0system will absorb energy released by terminated enemy vessels, giving you some extra time to work with. Make sure to use it well, or disaster will be inevitable.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you will find success in our tests and we trust that you report back if any issues occur.
