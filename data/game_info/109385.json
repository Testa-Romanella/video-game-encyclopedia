Because the competition started on a Monday I also had school on the 3 days I had to make this game so I ended up not doing much school work :). I made it in Unity, the art I made in Piskel and the music and sound effects are a free public asset on the asset store.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound:\u00a0https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/68228</p>\n<p>Music: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/78911</p>\n\n<p><strong>Me\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am a 17 year old student in Canada. Ive been doing game development, with afocus on programming, for 5 years. As of lately I've \u00a0been getting more serious anoint it.
