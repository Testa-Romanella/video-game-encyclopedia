Fly through the yellow speed boosters to go faster, try not to crash into anything that hurts. Everything contained in the game was created from scratch during the jam.

Unfortunately, this caused the difficulty to become INSANE. This will come back in a future post-jam build. While everything currently remains at the same scale, you will, however, find yourself crowded out by obstacles, while segments of the course are slowly removed over time leaving you with fewer options, and all of this gets further compounded as your speed increases.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T05:33:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16b1a70831fcc01d8573cc0a34fce1c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["noir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
