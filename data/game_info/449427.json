First off, apologies for the size of the project. My first time participating in a jam, and if you're still reading this message it means I still haven't figured out how to cut down its size for itch.io and make it playable in a browser. It's just under 1GB (made with UE4,)but I\u00a0promise you it's fun and worth the effort!\u00a0 I have it zipped in one folder, should play once extracted.</p>\n<p>WINDOWS build only! Can use a keyboard, or a Windows-style/XBox controller (see relevant menu in-game). Oh yeah, do check out the menu options when you fire it up...</p>\n<p>A dark fantasy platformer where you race against the clock, avoid deadly traps, collect bonus time to keep you in the game, solve some puzzles and collect treasure and abilities! What's not to like??</p>\n<p>Forgive the occasional glitch / bug here and there, if you have any questions or problems let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dea/dea917628271130fb9b165b4e84559e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodingRook"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
