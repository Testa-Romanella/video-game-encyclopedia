This time, rather than collecting stone ducks scattered around the world, you are tasked with journeying to the underworld in order to defeat The Void in his own domain. Don't fear- since you last adventure, you have learned both how to use weapons and how to take a hit without instantly fainting. Can you make it all the way down?</p>\n<p>This game was finished in early 2016 in order to explore random map generation and GUI design. Many of the assets in this game are inherited from Legend of the Stone Ducks, and in fact, the entire game is playable within Dungeons and Ducks! Just pick up the key in the hub room and enter the forest to begin your quest!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2eddef4506f02c90824a5ec9bfd5ffdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChiirYuu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
