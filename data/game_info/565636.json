{"id": 565636, "slug": "ruby-raider", "name": "Ruby Raider", "name_original": "Ruby Raider", "description": "<p><strong>You are in the ancient ruby temple, and you must find the ancient ruby\u00a0 that lies within. However, the door\u00a0\u00a0is locked. To unlock it, you must die three times at the door (and you must die at the door by touching it). If anything else kills you, you must start over. Once you die three times at the door, it will open, and you will be able to get the ancient ruby. This game was made for the WOWIE! Jam 3.0 where the theme was Failure is Progress. I think the game fits the theme because you have to die/fail at the door\u00a0three times to unlock the door/progress. The font is Arcade Classic, and made by Pizzadude. Ratings and comments would be appreciated!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T06:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/0879cf9d4476743ae8379fa493042d9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A J"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
