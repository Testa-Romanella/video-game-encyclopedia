The game is intended to be a sort of exploration of how we deal with our thoughts in certain respects, but I don't want to give too much away! I'd love to hear what you got from the game. The game's admittedly opaque title is a play on the words \"upend\" and \"dependence\".</p><p>The game takes ~15-20 minutes to complete, give or take.</p><p>Headphones or good speakers are *highly* recommended, as audio is a crucial part of the game.</p><p>Feel free to comment or email me at dpcreativework@gmail.com to discuss the game or just about anything else related! I welcome all negative and positive feedback. If you liked the game, check out me and my friend's facebook page to stay tuned on games to come! Or follow me at twitter.com/domportera to follow the development of my current personal project.</p><p>The game is definitely in need of a tweak when it comes to the synchronization of rhythm and axe-play, and I will hopefully get to that once I get some spare time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a99e757ec9a3fddbb8feba9b0b4476b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["domportera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
