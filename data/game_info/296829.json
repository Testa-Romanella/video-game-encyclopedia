For the gamejam I made Lovesighted, a 3D-isometric exploration-combat game with a small narrative. Fight against Slime Skeltons while trying to find a Revival Orb to revive your love, cause what could go wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, Return to Attack, Space to Interact with Certain Objects, Q to use a Flask to Heal if you have one.</p>\n<p>How to Play:\u00a0Explore the world and fight enemies you encounter. Gain score from gems, but the ultimate goal is to find the revival orb. If you die, youll drop 10% of your score as a pink gem. If you die before picking it up, it'll be gone for good!</p>\n<p><em>I will be releasing in the next week or so a process video with commentary about the entire gamejam! Keep a look out for that.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Note: I'm curious if anyone is interested in seeing this project go further so let me know!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tools Used:</p><ul><li>Unity 2019.1</li><li>Blender2.8/ProBuilder</li><li>Clip Studio Paint</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/423/4236222ba731141ebc4195130d5aedda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Experiett"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
