When the progress bar finishes, an icon appears above your head indicating the type of tea you're holding.<br/>After that, to add sugar to the tea, go to the sugar machine in the top right corner and interact with it to add a single portion of sugar.<br/>When the tea is completed, go to the customer for which you're preparing the order and interact with him/her to serve the tea.</p>\n<p>The goal is to serve as many customers as possible in the time limit.
