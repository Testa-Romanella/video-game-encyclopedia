Cosmodread features a rich, tense and immersive atmosphere that will make you forget about the world outside the headset.<br/><br/><h3>EXPLORE</h3><br/>Search for resources and find a way home. Every run will have you play in a new procedurally generated layout, with random positions for rooms, corridors, items and hazards, and different emergent situations. You\u2019ll never quite know what\u2019s behind the next door.<h3>SURVIVE</h3><br/>Use your own hands to interact with the environment. Open doors, drawers and lockers and rummage through their contents. Collect basic resources, and craft weapons and equipment to deal with both enemies and hazards.<h3>FIGHT</h3><br/>Crouch behind cover and shoot at enemies with your crossbow, or set a trap for them to walk into. But remember: ammo is scarce! Sometimes it\u2019s better to just grab an object off a shelf and throw it away to distract the creature sniffing after you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you are interested in Cosmodread, check out Dreadhalls, the previous title by White Door Games:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/589200/Dreadhalls/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T04:08:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/170/170c68d0b50b8f3f7904f56f68541bd5.jpg", "website": "http://www.cosmodread.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 25}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["White Door Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["White Door Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
