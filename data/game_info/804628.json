This is only a beta version for testing mechanics. More updates will be in the future!)<br/></p><p>(UPDATE NOTE: This is still not the full game, it is being made with GB Studio which has a vast amount of limitations, I cant find any active forums and the programs been updated 3 times now so old forums arent helpful. I am still just learning and this is now a Demo version. until I find another beginner platform for RPG game design that is free (I do not wish to spend money in case I give up on this little hobby) I hope that you can still enjoy this tho!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T23:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdd/cddf44ab89ea96a2fd997184839b7dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChaoticHare"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
