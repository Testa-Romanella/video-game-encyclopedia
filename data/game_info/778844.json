It is made for people who like the imagination and emotion of table-top role-playing games and the structure and accessible strategy of board games.</p>\n<p>This release (version 0.9) is an ashcan/play-test version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you play this game, please tell me how it went in the comments below.</p>\n<p>If there is enough interest, this game will be updated and improved upon.
