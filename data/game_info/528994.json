The objective of all 4 players is to find and be the first one at the bamboo vault. There can only be one winner, but teamwork is not against the rules. Players begin in different segments of the facility, and will overcome multiple obstacles and events on their way to finding the vault room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Introductory Lore:<br/>Pandas. Beautiful creatures that bring joy and wholesome memories to the minds of many. In the eyes of humans they are a species that need to be cared for and fed....but when human eyes are no longer on them it is a different story.\u00a0 Pandas are just like humans, they have their own personalities and their own lives. Much like humans do, they carry out traditions that have been around for thousands of years. One of these traditions is the annual panda heist, a coming of age rite that all aspiring pandas\u00a0complete on their journey to adulthood,\u00a0prosperity, and ultimate cuteness.\u00a0Which Panda will reap the rewards? You decide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Tabletopia\u00a0Playzone\u00a0Link:<br/></p>\n<p>https://tabletopia.com/playground/panda-heist-rk9316/play-now<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:38:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaaed9f4205e916b81ce69987792bcff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
