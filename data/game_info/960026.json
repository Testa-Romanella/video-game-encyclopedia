It offers a selection of upgrades and unlockable weapons that is more limited than what will be available in the full game. The bosses are pre-determined instead of randomized, and there are a limited number of enemy mergers possible. Additionally, some types of special rooms will only be included in the final version of the game</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Shapes &amp; Shots is a Roguelite Shooter Bullet-hell , where you can control time as you make your way through a twisted and delusional universe. Your enemies will merge, creating infinite combinations to try to overwhelm you: only your skills, combined with the variety of upgrades you choose, can lead you to victory.<br/><br/><br/>When it gets tough out there and you realize there is no cover, or when you are about to be overwhelmed by a barrage of bullets... Stop everything, take a deep breath, and reposition yourself behind the enemies. Unload all your might against them and turn the tide.<br/><br/><br/>In this universe, enemies can merge, combine the power of their weapons, and gain unique characteristics. Take care of them before they realize that unity is strength.<br/><br/><br/>Challenges will increase: you must level up to increase your base characteristics. Choose whether to enhance the ability to control time or to increase mobility and damage.<br/>But that is not all. In your climb to victory, you will find many chests that will grant you access to unique game-changing powers!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T04:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cc/8cc1769d2b510eab88e724fbc4d7bf22.jpg", "website": "https://visiogs.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Visio Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Visio Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
