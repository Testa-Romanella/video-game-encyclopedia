Good luck!)</p>\n<p>The not-so-distant future. The year 199X. A recent scientific discovery has made it possible to access alternate dimensions of reality through the\u00a0manipulation of genetic\u00a0code sequences.<br/></p>\n<p>While governments argue over how to address the issue,\u00a0there\u2019s\u00a0been a gold rush of criminal activity in this new, wild frontier. Rogue genetic splicers offer their services to the highest bidders, and high-rolling criminals of all types (mostly corrupt politicians and tech corporations) have begun shifting reality for their own unethical agendas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you are\u00a0the Turbotime Gumshoe. And even more fortunately, your boss is\u00a0a stolen,\u00a0sentient laptop computer with a\u00a0Genetic Timeline Manipulator app installed. Together, you have the ability to literally\u00a0<strong>ROOT</strong> out dangerous fugitives hiding in alternate dimensions by\u00a0piecing together clues about their genetic traits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few months since your last job. But today, the laptop\u2019s light blinked on, and a doozy of a case came in...</p>\n<p>Based on the available leads, build a hunch about your target's manipulated genetic pathway. Then activate\u00a0Turbotime in hopes of reaching the correct dimension and\u00a0apprehending them before they cause potentially catastrophic damage to reality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Programming : Tyler Edwards<br/>Art, Animation : Hagen Deloss<br/>Audio, Script : Aspen Farer<br/>Game design and concept : Everyone!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6a2ebc8d1844f3a11739490b9331705.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gloombones", "LaserWolf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
