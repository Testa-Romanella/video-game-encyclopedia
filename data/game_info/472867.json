Some of the code also from my old pal Gustavo, from my Nano Games days.

It's not 1:1, but quite close.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that I'm aware my shader has some issue and never really worked all that well - but works well enough for this game.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:06:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e2054af04b96703d383af87963a97639.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel \"MontyOnTheRun\" Monteiro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
