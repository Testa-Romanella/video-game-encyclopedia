Try not to be seen as a feline or in a restricted area. (Don't worry about the first few guests, they're blind drunk.)</p>\n<p>If you're seen, don't get grabbed by the guards or it's over.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you grab the gem, it releases a pressure plate that sounds an alarm through the whole place. Bring it back outside and over the fence to win.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nDesign and Program\r\n<p>Iori Branford</p>\r\nSprite Art\r\n<p>Snow Rose https://twitter.com/vegetationwitch<br/></p>\r\nBackground Art\r\n<p>Mucho Pixels House Interior Tileset Pack https://muchopixels.itch.io/house-interiors-tileset-pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c86c7549bd8f8f309edb3d4c12ed87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["IoriBranford"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
