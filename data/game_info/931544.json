{"id": 931544, "slug": "riot-overlay-twitch", "name": "Riot Overlay | Twitch", "name_original": "Riot Overlay | Twitch", "description": "<p>So here is my first game ever : a \"moving debate\" to use as an overlay on your Twitch streams, and that your viewers can play via the chat to position themselves on different areas (and therefore different opinions), being able to change at any moment. The point is to discuss anything and see how opinions change during the debates.<br/></p>\n<p>You can :</p>\n<ul><li>set 2 to 5 zones, placed anywhere to match your scenes</li><li>change the zone labels</li><li>see viewers as dots or random characters</li><li>call everyone back to the first zone before launchiong a new debate</li></ul>\n<p>I've tested it with up to 2K fake viewers before seeing a lag (on an old machine), and it has been tested live thanks to Gaymerick on Twitch (with few viewers).<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to give me feedback, I'll try my best to fix things I can. Depending on interest, I might add other features (\"riot\" is supposed to mean something at some point, but i didn't get to this stage for the moment).</p>\n<p><strong>How to use<br/></strong></p>\n<p>It is best if you create a bot account on Twitch, and give it moderation permissions on your channel. You'll also need to get its token from this page (with your bot account connected on twitch) : https://twitchapps.com/tmi . <br/>Use your bot's name and its 0auth key on the Connection Panel.<br/>Also check \"Bot connection\" and set your username\u00a0 as your channel.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Your bot will appear in your chat, where you can test interactions (joining and changing zone) without live streaming by accessing your chat : http://twitch.tv/<strong>your_user_name/chat</strong> .</p>\n\n<p>Then go to the Options Panel where you can test things by  adding bot (with A key) and make them move randomly if you want so, or chose your display settings and the number of zones you want to use. These can be changed at any time.<br/></p>\n<p>Finally, you can click on a zone's name to change it, and move any zone by grabbing its number (characters will follow shortly after you moved the zone).</p>\n<p><strong>What viewers have to do</strong></p>\n<p>From the moment you connected your bot, they'll have to type <em>!join</em> command to get their avatar inside the game (they'll got to \"Neutral\" Zone), then <em>!1</em> , <em>!2</em>, and so on, to move their avatar to the according zone.</p>\n<p>An avatar will quit the game a few moments after his viewer leaves your stream or with <em>!quit</em> command.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cr\u00e9dits</strong></p>\n<p>Big thanks to Solocode for his great discord server and ressources, Mr.Eliptik for his stream overlay on which i based this work, Fleurman for his tiny characters spritesheets, and the Godot Engine's contributors !<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T10:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf4f5446e58f3b06cc70bf0d918e59c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cousscouss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
