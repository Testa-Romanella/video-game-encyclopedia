Make your paddle faster. Make your opponent's paddle smaller. Watch the ball violate every law of physics. (Even the third one! Especially the third one!) Every game is different. And be careful! Modifiers add up, and they last for the whole game.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to install\r\n<p>\n<strong>Have a Playdate?</strong> Sideload Doink! using Panic's official instructions.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Playdate yet?</strong> Install the Playdate SDK for Windows, Mac, or Linux and play it on the Playdate Simulator.\r\n</p>\r\nComing soon\r\n<ul>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Modifier descriptions</li>\n<li>More modifiers</li>\n<li>Secret sound effects and easter eggs</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Game and art by Mostly Bits (Kyle Shipley and Tony Dewan)</li>\n<li>\r\n    Sound effects:\r\n    <ul>\n<li>WeLoveIndies</li>\n<li>Onikage22</li>\n<li>Kyle Shipley</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n    Fonts:\r\n    <ul>\n<li>Playdate</li>\n<li>Displaay Type Foundry / Anymade Studio</li>\n<li>Olexstudio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T14:08:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a234020ae601fecacf68d9a69035f32e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mostly Bits"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
