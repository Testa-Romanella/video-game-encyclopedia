As one of the town's popular CEOs, he is held to a high standard in the public eye. After previously losing his daughter on Halloween night of last year, this Halloween has become immensely difficult to bear. After arriving home from work, he decides to lock up for the night in hopes of being left alone. Throughout the night children from the apartment complex's annual Trick-or-Treat fest come knocking on his door. The player must survive the night in his apartment by keeping lights turned off and silencing any noises.
