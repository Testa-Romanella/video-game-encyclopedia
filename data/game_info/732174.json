{"id": 732174, "slug": "terrain-box", "name": "Terrain Box", "name_original": "Terrain Box", "description": "<p>Modify terrain settings, make strange terrain, bend the world\u00a0and have fun experimenting with the terrain generation in this free sandbox terrain generator.</p><p>The premise of the game\u00a0is that while you can't paint terrain you can change how the world makes itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a little terrain generator game I made. I had quite a lot of fun playing it so I wanted to share it with people.\u00a0 I have some plans to update this in the future although that would mainly depend on whether anyone plays this game. The performance is a big issue with this game so when you can, try to use a small map size as the generator needs to make less terrain so is better for performance.</p>\n<p>The terrain is fairly basic at this stage as there is no different biomes only height maps with colours set to those values. Never the less it can still look quite nice in many different styles such as rugged edges and even smooth edges.</p>\n\n<p>I should point out that the original terrain generation was from a Sebastian Lague\u00a0\u00a0tutorial.

Other interfaces such as buttons can be interacted with Left Mouse Button.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/801/80172918eee28a8ff20d1265b0d26002.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gaming Tardigrade"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
