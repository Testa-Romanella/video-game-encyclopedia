{"id": 677788, "slug": "the-ability-to-find", "name": "The Ability to Find", "name_original": "The Ability to Find", "description": "<p>\"The Ability to Find\" is an emotional\u00a0short story about a person with the ability to find lost things. Whenever they touch a lost object, they have visions related to its memory, which could be a blessing or a curse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first game I made all by myself from scratch, excluding the music which was created by Abakau\u00ea. That means I wrote the story, made all the illustrations AND programmed it using Ren'Py!\u00a0It's more of a story than a game since there aren't really any mechanics, but I did everything in five days for Global Game Jam 2021 and I'm super proud of it nonetheless!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you like it! And, if you do, please leave a comment, it means a lot to me &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T05:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3af05804cfa61a3f3a5dddb1557940b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Maweall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
