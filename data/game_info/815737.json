I decided to concentrate my efforts into this project after being in a creative lull, and here is the result.</p>\n<p>Creating the interface and typography for this game was both a labor of love and utter tedium. I've always been a fan of farm sims, so I tried to incorporate that into the experience as well. This is brief and much of the \"narrative\" is embedded inside the objects you interact with. Hopefully, you'll derive some enjoyment from it even if some of the tasks themselves are \"mundane.\" Perhaps one day I'll\u00a0do a more proper \"point-n-click\" adventure game. In the meantime, this homage should suffice.</p>\n<p>Credit goes to\u00a0bitsy,\u00a0pixsy,\u00a0bitsy muse ui,\u00a0freesound.org, and, lastly,\u00a0borksy for the ease of implementing assorted hacks.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T08:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c4f18aa20ed08da115da52314f5aa2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["graymeditations"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
