In fact, you will be playing a Hero and his Soul. They need to be brought back together, otherwise the hero will definitely die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a purgatory type of place where a corrupted fog comes and destroy everything in its path. Run as fast as you can but mind the traps... ;)</p>\n<p>Speed, agility and two handed synchronicity\u00a0will be your main skills during this journey.</p>\n<p>Feel free to give us some feedbacks and most importantly to rate the game\u00a0for the GMTK GameJam ranking !\u00a0</p>\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n<p>- Not able to restart a level, we are very sorry but we have a problem with the restart button, please quit &amp; relauch the level, when you die.\u00a0It's fixed but we need to wait the end of the GameJAM for push the new version thank you &lt;3\u00a0</p><p>If you want to give a try to the last fixed version now :\u00a0https://loicdelaunay.fr/projets/sidesoul.zip</p>\n\r\nGameplay &amp; Screenshots\r\nCore\r\n<p>You play two characters at the same time with this layout :\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, there is a blue line representing the <strong>bond\u00a0</strong>between the Hero and his Soul. If you go too far the bond will break and you'll have to restart the level.</p>\n<p>As for the controls well... It depends. How come you say ? Well let me introduce the:</p>\r\nDifficulty Scaling\r\n<p>The difficulty increases with two factors :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The Synchronization Mode.</strong></li></ul>\n<p>There are 4 different synchronization mode. With each comes a different difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>1. Normal</strong></p>\n<p>In this Sync mode, you play with ZQSD your hero and arrow keys for the Soul.</p>\n<p>It is represented in game by this icon :</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>PartialSync</strong></p>\n<p>As it is partial, you will have one key in common between the Hero and the Soul... You will quickly find which one ;)</p>\n<p>Its representation:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Sync</strong></p>\n<p>Well, just like the previous one, but your whole controls are synced !</p>\n<p>Its representation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Chaotic</strong></p>\n<p>Chaos.</p>\n\n<p>While those Synchronization modes do increase the difficulty, we thought it was not enough.</p>\r\nLevel Difficulties\r\n<p>Each level has 3 different difficulties:<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Easy - Medium - Hard.</p>\n<p>The number of traps will increase with the set difficulty. Fun !</p>\n\r\nCombination\r\n<p>The global difficulty will then be defined by :\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current map (0 - 6) / The Sync Mode / The Level Difficulty</p>\n<p>For example, the hardest level is the <strong>6th map</strong> with the <strong>Chaotic Sync Mode</strong> and <strong>Hard </strong>difficulty.</p>\n<p>This gives us a total of : 7 maps * 4 Sync modes * 3 Difficulties...\u00a0</p>\r\n84 REPLAYABLE\u00a0LEVELS !\r\n<p>A whole ton of fun as far as one can see !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, you will have to unlock each and every one of the levels.</p>\n<p>Here is a small preview of the Level Selector :\u00a0</p>\n<p>A whole world of challenges is waiting for you !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get started right now by downloading <strong>Side Soul</strong>!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:52:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/2449d5b0fd2deebf9714e2f32bd9aa06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dream", "Pantoine", "LucasBonifay"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
