I will give the game development and much more.</p>\r\nFuture of the project:\r\n<p>At the moment this project is not my main project <strong>(Its only experiment)</strong>, but if suddenly you are interested in it, then please leave a comment about it below, this will let me know that you are not indifferent to the game and then I will finish it and it will appear on Steam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be4e3ff980a1a01adf7cc91ddae8a89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Red Starship"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
