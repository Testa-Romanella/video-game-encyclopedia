We would love to make more levels for this introducing new mechanics and developing on all ready established ones, as we have never really made a puzzle game before and it was a fun and challenging experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ea/5eaee15d3591df5cb2be09f963f70a65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JaGTeK Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
