You are given buttons that you can use to help jam the transmission for the different satellites such as dissipating the message, neutralizing the message, scrambling the Message, and rephrasing the message. In addition to this, to increase your chance of success, you can also try hacking the communications by playing a mini-game where you have to either rearrange a word or decipher a Caesarian cipher. Doing these mini-games will avoid the chance you are detected.</p>\n<p>Tip: Before the signal passes satelite 1 and satelite 2, select one of the satellites and pick at most two other options such as dissipate, neutralize, scramble, and rephrase and then hit execute. Doing this will help your chance of winning if you guess right.</p>\n<p>Tip: If you can do the Caesar cipher, you will win the game. Doing the cipher is very hard.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Programmers - Joshua Heideman and Benjamin Bjorkman</p>\n<p>Music - Benjamin Bjorkman</p>\n<p>Art - Benjamin Bjorkman<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/829d53bb4f64e5fd8c1177bd3249d712.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jcheideman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
