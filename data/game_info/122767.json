You get up, complete puzzles to keep you occupied, then you go to bed at the mercy of an AI controlled schedule. It's all you've ever known and life's easy, but you can't help wondering, maybe there's more? Maybe you just need to think outside the box.</em></p>How to play<p>WASD to move, mouse to look, left click to interact with objects.</p><p>You can either be satisfied completing the puzzles or you can try to bust out of your little utopia. There's currently two ways to bust out.</p>Developer notes<p>Originally intended to have more than one puzzle... but time constraints :(</p><p>Every tile lights up when you touch it, essentially removing the need for any constant light source (though I did make the ceiling emit light to keep the lighting soft). This was achieved by using an instanced emissive material that responds to collisions and is 100% dynamic - no lighting is baked, only precomputed.</p><p>Pressure plates use some fancy force calculations to determine if enough pressure is on them to actuate. As fancy as they are, you can't stack cubes on top of each other, they must be touching the plate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80e3ec013e174f29a5dac4e002df33db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MUCK GAMES"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
