After some consideration I call my game for \"Date Fever\". This is not a full game, and many ways to proceed to a full game from this idea is possible.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Basically this is a sliding puzzle game. I suggest to beginner begin the game in difficulty 1-3.<br/><br/>Explanation:<br/><strong>Jumping person</strong> - person\u00a0in correct position.<br/><strong>Person with heart</strong> - \"in love\" can swap position. Cure return to correct position.<br/><strong>Love counter</strong> - when next to make a random person \"in love\".<br/><strong>Speed up button</strong> - speed the game and not least the counter up. Making someone \"in love\" can be a tactic. Because they can swap. This is good at the end of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Use the mouse.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/>Programmer: Huy Xuan Ngo<br/>Sounds and Graphics:\u00a0kenney.nl<br/>Music: Joshua McLean</p>\n\n<p>note:<br/>Contains music\u00a0\u00a92019 Joshua McLean (mrjoshuamclean.com)\r\nLicensed under\u00a0Creative Commons\u00a0Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54343703524082765bf5680a2df43dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Huy5000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
