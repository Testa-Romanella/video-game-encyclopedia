The game has already gone through a massive overhaul and will continue to do so,\u00a0 with your feedback and help.</p>\n<p>The donation pricing has been added - if you wish to support us, you can; any support is appreciated but just downloading, playing, and giving feedback is amazing for us.</p>\n<p>Objectives:<br/></p>\n<p>Get the <strong>Keycard</strong> from the Guard Tower<br/>Enter the <strong>Warehouse</strong> and Locate the<strong>\u00a0Manifest</strong><br/>Steal the <strong>Package</strong><br/><strong>Escape!</strong> (Exit is at the bottom of the map)</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>E - Interact<br/>LMB - Toggle Torch</p>\n<p>Feedback Form:\u00a0https://goo.gl/forms/0KRQtCluBR7RHbjl1<br/></p>\n<p>Follow us:</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/saltystudiosaus/<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/SaltyStudiosAus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fac8c6cccf23b35fd2958fd3ac347eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SaltyStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
