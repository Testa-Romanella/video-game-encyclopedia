You will start using WASD to move, but half a minute later that may have changed to Z3O and the spacebar.</p>\n<p>We put a lot of emphasis on the sound design of the game, that features a short track which changes every time your controls change, as well as very pleasant keyboard presses with every input.</p>\n<p>The game also features progressive difficulty, making droplets spawn at higher rates and with faster speeds as time passes.</p>\n<p>Made by Javier V\u00edctor D\u00edaz Salazar, \u00c1lvaro Lozano Gil and Jia Yun Liu.</p>\n<p>Credits to\u00a0Vilkas Sound - Free Music &amp; SFX for the title menu music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fa425416470e5cfa3dde597032d8654.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qwernasivob", "Graco"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
