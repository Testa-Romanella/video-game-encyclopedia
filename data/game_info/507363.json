Viewer discretion is advised.<br/></p><p>Mechanics In-depth:\r\nYou can jump and flip gravity after a certain height. <br/>You can dash through stars for points.\r\n<br/>When you change gravity stars will fall on you so be careful.<br/>\r\nBig blue orb powerup turns you transparent for a short while so you can go through objects.\r\n<br/>The green bar at the bottom shows how long you have left with the power up.</p>\n<p>The red bar at the bottom shows how long until you can dash again.\r\n<br/>When the boss spawns he follows your Y access then locks on and shoots. <br/>Try to time it so that he shoots somewhere and you can change gravity in time to get out.<br/>\r\nafter that he comes at you 3 times (won't hurt you) and you can dash into him to lower the red health bar at the top of his head.\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen you change gravity things spawn in that lane.<br/> You can create extra space by dashing right after, as objects are white and won't come at you at first. <br/>This timing will create extra gap for you to not get locked in and die.\r\n<br/>\r\ntaping dash while dashing again will cause you to shoot vertically you can see this demonstrated in the game play video.\r\n<br/>\r\nPressing the menu button will let you remap any keyboard/xbox keys.<br/> This won't save (yet) but full screen will.\r\n</p>\n<p>There you can adjust volume as well.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c84/c8461ac112720fb24e2b57dc2e8fde07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TNJGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
