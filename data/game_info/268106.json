The highscore is calculated based on your performance and your settings.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move using WASD or TFGH</li><li>Shoot using the left mousebutton</li><li>Reload with the right mousebutton or the spacebar</li><li>Change weapon using the scrollwheel or the numbers 1-4</li></ul>\r\nSettings\r\n<p>The difficulty slider controls the ratio between the three character types of the enemies. Realism influences the intelligence of the enemies and yours. Oneliners are turned off by default, but turn them on if your a total badass. With limited control enabled, the player moves to the position you're firing at instead of with the traditional move keys.\u00a0The most difficult set-up is difficulty and realism to the right, FOV to the left, Auto reload off,\u00a0Auto equip off and limited control on.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 50 hours</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d648aeea8177e0ded33ac8c7eb3437e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
