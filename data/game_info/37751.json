{"id": 37751, "slug": "titan-quest-immortal-throne", "name": "Titan Quest: Immortal Throne", "name_original": "Titan Quest: Immortal Throne", "description": "<p>This expansion pack concludes the plot of the original Titan Quest with the fourth act that leads the player into Hades, the Greek underworld of the dead. Immortal Throne is not standalone and requires the original to be installed (unlike Titan Quest Gold, which contains both), and the main quest should be completed to reach Hades. <br />\nThe game is a sword-and-sorcery fantasy set in Ancient Greece and strongly inspired by Greco-Roman mythology. The plot continues the story of the player\u2019s character as a champion of mankind who fights against the evil titans. Due to his or her victories, the supreme god Zeus proclaimed that humanity is strong enough and Olympians don\u2019t have to protect it anymore. <br />\nGameplay in Immortal Throne is similar to any other hack and slash game with the point-and-click interface. Compared to the original, Immortal Throne introduces several new items and a new skill called Dream Mastery that allows the player to make enemies fight each other using illusions, or hypnotize them to sleep. All improvements can be used from the beginning of the game, not only in the missions from the expansion. There\u2019s also a new multiplayer option that allows player-vs-player team-based deathmatches.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2007-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/02d/02d70f4bacfa1f03fbd1c5896a963084.jpg", "website": "http://titanquestgame.com", "rating": 4.14, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 28, "owned": 752, "beaten": 124, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 34, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 138, "suggestions_count": 651, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 140, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iron Lore Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["THQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
