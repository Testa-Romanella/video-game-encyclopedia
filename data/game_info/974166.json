Persist for 12-15 days, and you can unlock the ending.<h3>Game features:</h3>- This is a relatively slow-paced game, with many relaxing waltz music built in (you can listen to it at the radio downstairs) hoping to add some leisurely feeling to the end-of-the-world life;<br/>- The shooting part of the game is very simple, more importantly, it is the judgment of the trajectory of the falling object, which requires some spatial sense;<br/>- The initial health value, package content, and plot dialogue order have a certain randomness, and each game may be different;<br/>- The plot part unexpectedly talked about some serious content...<br/>- The game has some structure that induces flow, which was done intentionally, hoping to bring some experience more or less.<h3>Developer's TIPS:</h3>1. It takes 1 hour to clear the game at the fastest, and there is no pause in the middle;<br/>2. There are a total of three endings, please note that it is not a death page, although there are also three ways to die;<h3>Developer\u2019s Note:</h3> I love games with the worldviews of series like Fallout and Metro, so this game was also inspired by the gameplay of Fallout 4 \u201cscavenging\u201d (and also by a game called \u201c\u62bd\u5361\u4eba\u751f\u201d) <br/>This is also the second game I started to make SOLO. When I started making it, I originally wanted to add a building system, but I didn\u2019t know how to make a suitable design under the condition of SOLO development, so I gave up and finally formed the current game form. <br/>I pay tribute to the Fallout and Metro series of games that I like. If the timing is right, maybe I will continue to develop other games under the worldview of 2083 (after that, it will definitely not be Wang Lei as the protagonist\uff09<br/><br/>Recently I\u2019m developing another game that should be more funny and crazy. <br/>The worldview of 2083, I think it\u2019s still a bit heavy, right? <br/>So I\u2019m currently developing another game that is more \u201ccrazy\u201d and relaxed, I hope to meet you all in the next year.<br/><br/>==================<br/><br/>The free contents used are as follows.Thank you very much for the author's open sharing.Thank you!<br/><br/>[\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u8bc6\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09 = Exit Sign Board - by ROY]<br/>https://skfb.ly/oxuJI<br/><br/>[\u65e5\u5149\u706f = SciFi Light 04 - by inuhitman]<br/>https://skfb.ly/6nBOP<br/><br/>[\u6536\u97f3\u673a = SciFi Crate 7 - by ZliaWili (https://sketchfab.com/zliawili) - licensed under CC-BY-4.0]<br/>https://skfb.ly/6BVDN<br/><br/>[\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5145\u7535\u76d2\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= sci fi box Free 3D model - by Vooc-3d]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/sci-fi-cupboard<br/><br/>[\u5145\u7535\u76d2\u67b6\u5b50\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= Hardware wall bracket Free 3D model - by son-of-the-wind]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/hardware<br/><br/>[\u63d2\u5ea7 = D and R Electrical Sockets and Switches FREE SAMPLE Free low-poly 3D model - by aitchkaycee]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/d-and-r-electrical-sockets-and-switches-free-sample<br/><br/>[\u63d2\u5ea7\u7684\u82af\u7247\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= i386 (80386) PGA 132 - by TriQMakar]<br/>https://skfb.ly/o8oBC<br/><br/>[\u4fdd\u9669\u67dc = Lowpoly Safebox two safe boxes with gold coins inside Free low-poly 3D model - by matotteus]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/lowpoly-safebox<br/><br/>[\u5f39\u4e38 = Wooden Games Piece EOA:2022.197 - by Portland Museum]<br/>https://skfb.ly/oEAIq<br/><br/>[\u836f\u74f6\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= 3D Bottle of Pills - by Ennes Costa de Souza]<br/>https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-bottle-of-pills-1714550<br/><br/>[\u684c\u9762\u8f66\u5e8a = Desk Lathe - by Sergey Shavin]<br/>https://skfb.ly/6RsTH<br/><br/>[\u6cf0\u8fea\u718a\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= Teddy bears - by hectopod]<br/>https://skfb.ly/otFMG<br/><br/>[\u7ebf\u5708 = Cable Coil Free low-poly 3D model - by lvvrvlad]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/cable-coil-3576ba8d-434f-4556-9476-b8550481212c<br/><br/>[\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u677f = Solar Panel - by HichamSvr]<br/>https://skfb.ly/oEopJ<br/><br/>[\u7f8e\u5de5\u5200 = Box Cutter - by Lobke Van Gheluwe]<br/>https://skfb.ly/oqxHI<br/><br/>[\u94a2\u4e1d\u94b3 = Wire Cutter - by Robin Vandenberghe]<br/>https://skfb.ly/6VSov<br/><br/>[\u84c4\u7535\u6c60 = battery car Free 3D model - by ARIES-3D]<br/>https://www.cgtrader.com/products/battery-2e4ebeb5-c027-4146-9cd4-efe0a507fb5b<br/><br/>[\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08\u6709\u4fee\u6539\uff09= ( FREE ) Robot Drone SDC-01 - by SDC PERFORMANCE\u2122\ufe0f]<br/>https://skfb.ly/6YzXK<br/><br/>[\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0 = Workbench - by DudleyLong]<br/>https://skfb.ly/o8uns<br/><br/>Others - UE4 Store<br/><br/><br/>MUSIC &amp; SOUND EFFECT: <br/>pixabay<br/>[Fearless] by Muzaproduction - https://pixabay.com/users/muzaproduction-24990238/<br/>Royalty Free Music - https://musopen.org/music/<br/><ul><li>[Waltz in A flat major, Op. 64 no. 3]<br/></li><li>[Waltz in A minor, B. 150]<br/></li><li>[Waltz in B minor, Op. 69 no. 2]<br/></li><li>[Waltz in D flat major, Op. 70 no. 3]<br/></li><li>[Waltz in E flat major 'sostenuto', B. 133]<br/></li><li>[Waltz Op. 8, no. 3  NEED EDIT]<br/></li><li>[2 Waltzes, S.126b - 2.
