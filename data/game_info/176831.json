That's about it \u2013 I was going to have multiple methods of attack which all drew from their own little regenerating power source, requiring you to alternate, but it seems those things didn't quite make it.</p>\n<p>Would've gotten more done, but I wanted to take the weekend slow so I could enjoy it. In the end, I'm not unhappy, as I still made something and still had fun. I am however going to try (that's the keyword, there; *try*) to get this to the state I originally envisioned over the next week or two.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em>\u00a0I\u2019ve had issues with Unity Mac builds before where it would fail to start. I cannot test this however, so if you can\u2019t play the game on Mac, please let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a6120953593141ff2a1e8d23fd879594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LukeZaz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
