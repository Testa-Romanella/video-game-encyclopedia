Originally this prototype was created in order to progress my skillset and knowledge regarding Unity's physics &amp; particle system features (particularly involving 2D\u00a0effectors). However after coming across <strong>Photon Unity Networking (PUN)</strong> I decided to attempt to create a very raw and early multiplayer prototype to teach myself unity networking skills. I do plan to eventually revisit this prototype, however for now it serves as a very simplistic exploration of the PUN engine. Upon loading the game the user will be automatically connected to the PUN server and then prompted to join the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In the future I plan to properly optimize the networking code and reduce lag. There is currently infrastructure to support six players however once again the code is not yet refined and optimized to adequately support the capacity.<br/><br/><strong><em>Side Notes</em></strong></p>\n<p>1. This project was also created to experiment with effectors, as can be seen with the Vacuum, Fan and Void objects throughout the testing map.</p>\n<p>2. Multiplayer was initially supposed to be completed with NormCore however lack of 2D physics support prevented this.</p>\n<p>3. This prototype was never meant to be anything more, although I did want to go further with the project I had to accept that what was completed was sufficient for a working prototype. I believe I have achieved the adequate experience and knowledge that I set out to from this project (Basic Unity Multiplayer, Physics Experimentation)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90ba7265d9a5d2e058c40671f298e7c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Baxter Dulieu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
