Black ink spots will be placed randomly around the map and it is your job to jump around and collect all of the ink spots. Remember that there will be enemies(turrets). These turrets will shoot small yellow balls that will kill you. If they kill you you will have to redo the level all over again(you wont have to collect the ink spots you collected previously on the same world though). Once you've collected all the ink spots the game will greet you with a \"level complete\" message and you can chose to either go back to the main menu or go for another level. I hope you'll enjoy it! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/812/81240532af097e5bc1841e36e363fc15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["JavaProgrammer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
