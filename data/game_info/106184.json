When you do try to kill them, you find that the AI players fight for their lives and put up a good fight. Yet, because you've been conditioned to kill by all the FPS and Shooters you've played, you shoot them and...they go down in one hit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Text appears and displays a short bio of the AI player you just killed. Are these really just bot players? Another wave of AI Players comes to attack you, perhaps they are vengeful for you killing their comrades.

You kill one, you kill two, how many more are there?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Control your character with your mouse and keyboard. Aim and fire your pistol, but watch out, you only have 68 bullets. Fortunately, one hit kills the other player but you have 15 hits worth of life (why? because you are the chosen of course. you are the all power 'judge, jury, executioner' of a player).
