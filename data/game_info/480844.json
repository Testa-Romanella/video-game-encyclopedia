Interact with objects by clicking when you're close. Press escape to stop interacting.<br/></p>\n<p>This game features autosave and will pick up right where you left off!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<br/></strong>This is a fully playable but unfinished product. Here are some tips if you'd like to spend some time with this game.<br/></p>\n<p>There's no indicator for interactables but hopefully the objects that are interactable will be fairly obvious, there's not that many of them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately there's no way in-game way to clear your save or switch profiles. If you encounter a game-breaking bug during the jam voting period, please let me know, and you can reset your data by deleting all of the /idfbs/FILE_DATA entries in the Indexed DB section of your browser's developer console.</p>\n<p>There is a cave entrance on the screen to the left of the cherry tree. It's a bit hard to spot, but it's there! Finding the cave entrance is not one of the puzzles!</p>\n<p>There are puzzles that involve both audio and color. If you are either hard or hearing or colorblind, I'm sorry! I ran out of time to create fallbacks.<br/></p>\n<p>Sadly, there is no end screen. You have 'won' when you are able to light up all three of the starting pillars.
