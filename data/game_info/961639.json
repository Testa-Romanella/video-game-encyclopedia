{"id": 961639, "slug": "kairos-2", "name": "Kairos", "name_original": "Kairos", "description": "Kairos is an RTS fantasy experience that pits the player against the corruption in the world. The player must build structures and train soldiers, archers, and mages to fight alongside the hero and defeat the corruption. If left to its own devices, the corruption will send corrupted units to defeat the player's forces as well as expand and overrun the land until the player has nowhere left to hide. You must not only train soldiers to fight corrupted enemies but also create purifiers to reclaim the corrupted land.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe primary enemy the player will face is a corruption that slowly expands across the continent. The corruptions will not only hurt the players units, but it will build up it\u2019s own army of monsters to take down the player\u2019s kingdom. As such, it is the players job to keep his kingdom alive and, with enough effort, cure their homeland of this vile plague. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsing a collection of different units, structures, and magic, the player will be able to build and expand their kingdom into the corrupted parts of the world. As you expand, more resources will become available to the player. This will allow the player to continue to expand into the deeper corruption. Eventually, with enough effort, the player will completely purify the continent, making it a prosperous land.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T04:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1efd4da76142cdb8065863227312b79b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah Gallo", "Isaiah Hogue", "Nathaniel Kanooni", "Colby Nelson", "Tre Carlton"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Atrius Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
