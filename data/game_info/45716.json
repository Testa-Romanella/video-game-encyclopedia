Seconds to Square is a momentum-based action-platformer that takes this motion and turns it into a time manipulation mechanic!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDrawing boxes in Seconds to Square works exactly like selecting folders on your desktop! Draw a fast box by left clicking to augment your run speed and jump height or draw a slow box by right clicking to dodge projectiles!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe goal of Seconds to Square is to race against the clock as you draw boxes using left and right clicks to speed up or slow down time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e128f4512a6b61aff0beee66fdd42786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 110, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fast Fall Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fast Fall Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
