The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and get a high score (like an arcade game). Defeat the enemy viruses and chips coming towards you, and make sure to grab the keys from the evil KeyLogger to use special abilities (see below).</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>* Left-Clicking near the player will cause you to be launched away from the target.<br/>* Pressing space bar will shoot a bullet that will attempt to seek the nearest virus.<br/>*\u00a0Hitting CTRL will let you start a \"Control Sequence\". Tapping any of the valid characters (A, D, R, Z, Left, Right, Backspace) will cause that character to be added to the sequence. Afterwards, hitting the Enter key will terminate the sequence, and if it is valid (as well as if you have the required keys), something will happen:<br/></p>\n<p>Special Abilities:<br/>- CTRL + A: Destroy all viruses on the map.<br/>- CTRL +\u00a0D:\u00a0Destroy closest virus.<br/>- CTRL + R:\u00a0Reset your health to max.<br/>- CTRL + Z:\u00a0If you die and possess a \"Z\" key, typing the CTRL + Z sequence will re-spawn you from where you left off.<br/>- CTRL +\u00a0LEFT:\u00a0Shift to the left, and nearby viruses will shift to the right.<br/>- CTRL +\u00a0RIGHT:\u00a0Shift to the right, and nearby viruses will shift to the left.<br/>- CTRL + BACKSPACE: Destroy viruses in a straight line from where you stand.</p>\n<p>Find the game challenging?\u00a0Maybe you just want to try out the different keys but keeping getting Z keys? Try the following sequence (you do not need to have the required keys): CTRL +\u00a0LEFT + R + A + D + BACKSPACE +\u00a0Z +\u00a0RIGHT. (There is another secret sequence in the game).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e750815ab848d4ad28b1ef62333bf40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P0rtal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
