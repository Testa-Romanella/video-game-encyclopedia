Continue deeper and deeper into the mine..,</p><p>note; lost stuff can be re-aquired, new player will form at base.</p><p>\r\n\tWhile fully playable, <strong>thisMachine</strong> is not \"done\",. more may be added, given the time and resources.  Much could be done to optimize the code/rendering, but it runs fine on a middle of the road desktop PC. The simulation, collisions, etc. may breakdown if the program is given too little processing power.  Try again on a more modern system.</p><p>This video is of an earlier prototype.
