The game focuses on bringing audio into the main mechanics of its gameplay, where the player has to rely heavily on sound in order to complete its objective. In the game, the player will be placed in a maze-like environment, giving the freedom of exploration and immersive gameplay. <br/></p><p>The protagonist of the game found herself waking up in the world of COMA and have lost all her memory. She found out that in order to wake up from the coma, she have to collect all her lost memory in the maze and figure out the cause of her incident. However, the maze is full of puzzles and will drain her soul to death during her search. She has to constantly collect new souls to survive while solving the puzzles along the way. <br/></p><p>The aim of this project is to see how to put audio in an essential position in the game's mechanics and story. Making this game is an ambitious goal for me. From story making, world setting, visual, sound, and game programming, I've been trying to push the boundary of my capacity on this game. Unfortunately for the time given, I can only finish developing the first level. However, it's been a worthwhile journey making COMA, and I'm excited to continue making games. <br/></p><p>please leave your feedback thanks!</p><p>Hot Fixes : </p><p>- fixed spawn underneath the surface</p><p>- fixed the door closed area where you can't get back in after spawn</p><p>- you now cant grab the bird sound memory straight away </p><p>- fixed UI resolutions </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/37882092cd5f3063f20b9f1d84a975d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cliff Chen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
