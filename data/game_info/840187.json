And it appears, based on the others at this here table, he has stolen the love of others lives, too. What's this guy's deal? How does he go around stealing other people's significant others? And how are you and these other folks gonna work together to make sure that this rapscallion pays for what he has done?\u00a0</p>\n<p>While this TTRPG\u00a0is \"Cowboy\" themed and inspired, it is not exclusively meant for traditional Western cowboys (or even for your characters to be boys). There are many archetypes one can select within the world of cowboy: including the classic variety, soggy (pirate), plague (medieval/fantasy), and space. You can play it your way in a variety of settings - just make sure that Cotton Eyed Joe gets his comeuppance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was made in less than 12 hours for Lame Jam 20. Please go show KintaroTPC some love for the original One Page Cowboy RPG, too! Enjoy! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:51:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/7608fed1492c4d3fd630bccb57f8a122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anna Webster"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
