It is a Unity game about a private investigator who has to solve crimes from his apartment. The game was inspired by Subsurface Circular and it was my first attempt at narrative design, game design (using the Unity engine) and level design.\u00a0 It uses PixelCrushers Dialogue System to control the dialogue and the UIs and cinematography was done to resemble Subsurface Circular.</p>\n<p>The story ended up being a little rushed due to having to write up the dissertation and create the game at the same time but creating this game taught me some valuable things:</p>\n<ul><li>How to use Unity Animator</li><li>How to prototype a level within Unity (ProBuilder)</li><li>How to get NPCs to walk to a certain point by using navmesh agents</li><li>How to use Timeline to control animations (in this case, opening and closing a door).\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>The reason I'm posting this now is\u00a0 to show the first game I created in university and to show how my Unity and narrative design skills have gotten better as time goes on.\u00a0I hope you enjoy this game when you download it. </p>\n<p>Character models and animations from Mixamo.</p>\n<p>3D models (radiator, table etc.)\u00a0purchased from Turbosquid.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a8839363c372a7077983fea558b20a7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["toyinariyo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
