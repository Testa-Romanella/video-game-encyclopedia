I hope you enjoy the end result and please feel free to leave me some feedback below.

Chore objects will fill over time and you simply move over them to \"do\" the chore.</p>\n<p>Needs are shown at the bottom of the screen and will slowly drain as they go unfulfilled. Interact with objects of the same colour in the house to refill them.</p>\n<p>The large green yoga person is your sanity meter.
