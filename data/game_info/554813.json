The theme of the jam was power, so I wanted to give the player a way to cash in points to increase the snake's survivability. As well, Mini Jam includes a limitation, this one was Only 5 Colors.</p><p>At the start the snake will grow very long, and pick up a lot of speed as you eat apples. By spending your points on modifiers, you can reduce the tail and speed growth of the snake, allowing to achieve higher scores. You can also increase the maximum number of apples that can appear on screen at once (does not increase spawn rate).</p><p>Note: The modifiers are not well balanced, I almost didn't even add them but I felt like leaving them out kind of defeated the purpose given the jam theme.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Arrows</strong> - Move Snake<br/><strong>Z</strong> - Cancel<br/><strong>X</strong> - Select</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd8d7ef4a52464ee663da254c9b3382.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DeepFriedOreo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
