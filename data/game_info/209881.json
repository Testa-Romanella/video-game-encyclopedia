Your only way out is to go down each and every floor until you reach the exit. There's only one thing blocking your progress though, or rather, many many doors, and the annoying and dull conversationalists between you and the way out.<br/><br/></p><p>Kick your way through each puzzle by sending doors flying in a domino styled Skoban puzzle game. Remember that some paths might lock you inside forever and to not shy away from bouncing a flying door right back the way it came. Just be sure not to let them hit you On The Way Out.</p><p>Created by:</p>\n<p>Adam Liang, Andrew Cualing, Erik Miller, Richard Gillis</p>\n<p>Music by:</p>\n<p>Nils - Relix</p>\n<p>Raez - Hologram Jinn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd584711bbb1d7dae8feb7ca64ead757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ErikM615"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
