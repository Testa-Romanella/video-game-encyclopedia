It is also my 4th game for the Game Boy.<br/></p>\n<p>An egg will appear, and after a time one of two random pets will hatch. It will age and go hungry over time, and can be fed to stop it from starving. It will die from either starvation or old age, and let you start again once it has passed away.</p>\n<p>The other options (play &amp; heal) are only there as placeholders for the prototype to be expanded upon. Along with these options, a few other unused elements in the code are there to let me take this in the direction I intend.<br/></p>\n<p>Source code can be found on my github.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T02:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/673/673a733eb7457e7b6e75818930eb0563.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piers Bishop"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
