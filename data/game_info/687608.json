They wine and dine the corps and then show off some new tech that is supposed to get the teams all jazzed up for their next missions. This year, right as they are unveiling the new prototype, there's a bright flash of light, and your team finds itself one hour in the past. If you can't figure out how to stop the Time Loop Iterations, reality will unravel and the universe will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA Night Off\u201d is an independent production of Jared Mason and is not affiliated with THE COMPANY or MEGACORP Games.
