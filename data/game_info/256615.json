Meanwhile, if Johnny doesn't \"shape up\", his dad's gonna send him to military school. So Petra's getting the band back together.</p>\n\n<p>With Petra on guitar, Vin on drums, Jen on the mic and Johnny himself on bass, they'll write rad songs, practise hard and maybe even get that totally\u00a0bitchin' record deal.
