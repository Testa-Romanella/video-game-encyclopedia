It is 100% free to play, but if you're able to donate I'd appreciate it. If you like the work I do, you can also support here on my Patreon page:\u00a0https://patreon.com/user?u=4296259</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game relies HEAVILY on sound, so boost that bass, plug in those headphones, whatever! Just know if you can't hear this one, you are missing out on a BIG part of the experience! Have Fun!</p>\n<p>Suits</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a777af777b5ad6883ea481b2974b259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuitsnNukes"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
