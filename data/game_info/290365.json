However, robots are after your metal body. Dodge their dangerous attacks and use their own weapons against them.</p>\n<p>The weapons, the robots use, all have unique interactions with the other obstacles. For example the stomps which chase you, also go after the spiked balls the robots throw at you. This makes them super flat and slippery.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or the Arrow Keys to move around and figure out the best way to counteract the attacks.<br/></p>\n<p>The game includes 12 levels and a boss.</p>\n<p>The game was made for the Wowie Jam 2019.
