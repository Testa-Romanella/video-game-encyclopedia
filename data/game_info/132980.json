It was produced by participants from the New Mexico State Dona Anna Community College (DACC). The theme was a procedural polygon generator that reminded our team of a desktop screen saver. The story of our game focuses around an IT Support for a big Google-like company, who informed their boss that they had pushed out the update that fixed a screen saver bug for the building. The IT Support did not however push the update.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to run around the office and manually enable the screen saver for the PC\u2019s when people get up. If the person catches you trying to enable the screen saver, you will lose. Also if you do not get to the PC in a set amount of time, the monitor will explode and you will lose.\r\n  </p>\n<p>To enable the screen saver, use (Q) on keyboard and mouse, and (X) for xbox controller. We designed this project to be used with Oculus, but it is also playable without.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thank you from the DACC Team!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Jammers:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Michael Brown\r\n  </p>\n<p>Michael (Stubby) Osborne\r\n  </p>\n<p>Drew Sander\r\n  </p>\n<p>Patrick Burkhard\r\n  </p>\n<p>Patrick Scoggin\r\n  </p>\n<p>Karan Bhakta\r\n  </p>\n<p>Michael Huseman\r\n  </p>\n<p>John Martin\r\n  </p>\n<p>Devon Richardson\r\n</p>\n<p>Jose Burciaga</p>\n<p>Nathalia Ureno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af14b6b7cb12e472e4295f7d9594877.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drewmm7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
