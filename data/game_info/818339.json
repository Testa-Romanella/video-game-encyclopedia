Instead, you <strong>Roll The Dice</strong>\u00a0for a random 3 towers\u00a0after each enemy wave. Also, you can combine towers with each other to make new ones! Also, Water + Fire gives you a smoke tower that whenever 10 enemies pass them you get another 3 random towers.<br/>Also, you don't need to combine the towers to place them.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>R</strong> - to restart the level<br/><strong>Escape</strong> - to open the menu<br/><strong>Mouse</strong></p>\n<p>-=-=-=-\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Listen to the\u00a0soundtrack!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-=-=-=-\r\n</p>\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<ul><li>If you pause the game and go to the next level, you might encounter a black void that covers the whole screen. That's because its animation is stuck when time is paused, so just speed up the game time.\r\n</li><li>Whenever an enemy goes into a smoke (aka. random towers giver) it won't give you any points after it enters another smoke tower.</li><li>Whenever you pass the 10 points of the smoke tower and the wave was ended before you got to press the button to receive the new towers, it gives you only 3 towers (as opposed to 6). And also the UI might get in front of you while you are trying to place a tower.</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>ToasterHead</strong> - Programming / Design<br/><strong>\u00a0Guigroove</strong> - Art<br/><strong>IvanMishin </strong>- Art<br/><strong>Lone Rabbit</strong> - Music /\u00a0Cover Art<br/>Tejas Chichkar\u00a0- Playtesting and supoprt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e033ae55427f267db457b97e9cd40856.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["toasterhead", "Lone Rabbit", "Ivannn06", "Tejas Chichkar", "Guigroove"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
