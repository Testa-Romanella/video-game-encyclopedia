If you are having trouble climbing them, try to get a running start and jump near the base of the stairs to get a boost. Proceed to the left jumping over the table, and jump off the ledge. Complete the platform jumps and you should come across the <strong>legs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------</p>\n<p><em>Getting to the top floor</em></p>\n<p>Getting out of the bottom floor is the hardest part of the game so far. Get on the box closest to you\u00a0and move it to the left. Push the remaining two boxes over the gap so one box lands on the other side with the air vent. Push the box over the air vent and hop on the box mid-air to get a jump reset and hop out (we apologize for making this mechanic in the prototype without checkpoints)\u00a0. Navigate to the right section of the main floor and get in the air vent to get to the <strong>top floor</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>---------------------------</p>\n<p><em>Getting to the exit</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dodge the bullets and move to the left. If you're having trouble dodging, just keep sprinting the whole way and do a light jump near the table (like hurdling it) to reach the\u00a0<strong>exit</strong>! The camera stays on the door to emphasize the robot's exit from its environment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f52548f032f00b30f888697488cc00d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Desmazio", "Intradom", "FireSpark27"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
