Why? How?\r\n<p>Projekt Zero is a game me and\u00a0JinxCat\u00a0made for our IT lesson project. The goal was to make a fully playable game in C++ that had to be running inside of Windows console. We only had one month to make the game thusly making only small part of what we have planned for. We still decided to push the limits so you will experience sequences such as animations and even pseudo 3D using raycasting, all made from scratch without any external libraries. If you are interested, the code is about 3000 lines long, we used Blender for animations, Gimp for simple sprites and royalty free sounds and music from the internet.</p>\n\r\nWhat is next?\r\n<p>As you have probably noticed - we called this a demo. This is because we have planned for, and we are still thinking, about lot more. Whether we will be publishing the so called full version or second episode is partly dependant on how much free time we will be having, but mostly - on how much of an audience will the game build up. For now, we will be focusing on improving our skills and probably taking part in game jams.</p>\n\r\nNotices\r\n<ul><li>\"Use\" is an option, it is not just a menu title</li><li>Game was only tested\u00a0on Windows 10 default console, it probably won't work in any other scenario</li><li>Background music can be pretty loud, be aware of that\u00a0</li><li>The game can be misleading at some points</li><li>There is a pseudo-3D sequence at one point, bear that in mind</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:00:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b308d44e70cb4d8afcc04e2c62761f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Osicat"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
