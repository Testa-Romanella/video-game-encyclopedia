I HAVE ONLY MADE UP THE CODING AND WILL TAKE DOWN THIS GAME IF THEY WANT IT TO. MAYBE I'LL UPDATE IT LATER WITH MY OWN ASSETS BUT I'M LAZY AF SO PROBABLY IT WILL JUST GO DOWN.<br/></p>\n<p>Though this project was made by MissingWilliam, I want to thank Mailchan for being a voluntary bug tester. Seriously though he helped the experience improve a lot and I wouldn't have noticed problems with the game without his help.</p>\n<p>I love the original Plants vs. Zombies from Popcap. So why not try to do it on Construct 2? Oh... yeah, because I'm broke and can only get up to 100 events, true.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here's the furthest I could get with this mini project. I would've made my own assets and graphics (I indeed, tried changing some things from the images from google I found, just to make the images correlate more, but still basically not a single graphic here is mine.)</p>\n<p>So yeah, basically kill 100 zombies to win. However, coneheads are worth twice the kill and bucketheads are worth five times the kill.</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested on another test project, this time trying to get other plants to work for Construct, let me now and maybe I can get them. However, I don't promise I'm able to get more than 4 plants on the same game. Also, remember that would be 3 since Sunflower is basically impossible not to have.</p>\n<p>I usually make up my own assets but I realized that if I did that, this project would never come up (or maybe it would, maybe it's just me making up excuses to be lazy, idk.) Also, no sound since this is just a test. Maybe I'll add sounds later or smth. However I may have to sacrifice something if you guys want background music since I ran out of events :(</p>\n<p>If any employee from Electronic Arts is reading this for some reason and want this project down, I'll take it down. Just tell me and I'll do it. If I re-upload it, it will be with different assets, this time my own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da9428a474d217384ec7de7ff403c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MissingWilliam"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
