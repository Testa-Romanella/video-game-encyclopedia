Only his quick thinking and powerful jumps will allow him to avoid his dastardly foes, ravenous dust bunnies and atrocious needle-hawks! Help Reginald reach the end of the record before the song runs out, or else he\u2019ll be forced to go through the vicious cycle again!</p>\n<p>Remember, if you ever need to think a difficult platforming section through, you can always pause the game to plan out your next steps.</p>\n<p>@retr0titan: Artist and animator</p>\n<p>@lapspider45: Playtester and playlist consultant</p>\n<p>@gavinlochtefeld: Game Design and Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Works created ahead of Jam time:</p>\n\n\n<p>Main menu audio: Edward Elgar - The Crown of India, Op. 66 - 3.
