When the player clicks on a egg, it will make a noise (which could indicate leveling up). After a certain amount of clicks, the egg will hatch into a random Pok\u00e9mon. (Either Pichu, Magickarp, Ditto, Eevee, and Jigglypuff). The eggs and Pok\u00e9mon will also move around to simulate how real pets would wander around and explore the environment. There is background music, as well as level up and hatching sound affects. The eggs also come in different colors, and of random chance, but I was unable to make them hatch into specific Pok\u00e9mon.</p><p>Music: I do not own any of the music. (All music was from the Pok\u00e9mon games.)</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Pok\u00e9mon Center Theme</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Level Up Noise</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Evolution Noise\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e17d65695229f1212a1ea5c2b13bd3e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Leon Chen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
