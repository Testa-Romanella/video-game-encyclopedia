Refill your Fire Gauge by landing. You can cancel out of an Inferno Punch with a jump at no extra cost to you Fire Gauge.\u00a0</p><p>Most recent update - v1.0 - I have added an enemy (but it doesn't hurt you). Killing the enemy refills you Fire Gauge a little. Your jump now discharges fire, turning it into another attack in your arsenal. I've made the Fire Gauge prettier! ^-^</p>\n<p><strong>I hope you have fun !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d366d75791a225b9b42413ae34a88af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tekugare"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
