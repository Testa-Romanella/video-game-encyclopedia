Other players can then react to the request with a motivational message chosen from a list and an optional gift. If a player chooses to send a gift, they select a sticker from their unlocked stickers which they want to give the player. The player can also personalize the gift by changing the color of the gift and ribbon. The player\u2019s companion, the owl, will deliver the gift to the requester upon sending. In return, the recipient can \u201cthank\u201d the sender, by sending a heart, to let them know they appreciate the gift they have received. All messages received, will end up in the recipient's mailbox. The mailbox can be viewed anytime by the player to look back on received messages. When the player gets a sticker out of a gift that they have not received yet, this sticker will then be permanently unlocked for them to use in future gifts. </p>\n<p>Players can write down everything that comes to their minds in their personal diary. Only the player can see their personal diary. These diary entries can consist of the player\u2019s overall feeling, represented by a smiley: sad, neutral, or happy. The player can also add a message they write themselves, and stickers they unlocked through gifts. The player can also add a diary entry by just tapping a smiley without writing about their day or clicking a smiley without writing the entry itself</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T07:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df24942942dfaebd533172569dc0ab53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isabel Pijnenburg", "Sander", "Mugiwara_No_Titan", "AlwayzPatrick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
