There was peace and harmony until it was invaded by dragons. <br/><br/>Like any living space, Sibull requires of these 5 elements to maintain the stay of its own citizens to a life of peace and harmony. <br/><br/>A lack of one of these elements or all, Sibull residents have suffered drastic changes in the functioning of their body, they lost the harmony and can not love, laugh and enjoy the life.
