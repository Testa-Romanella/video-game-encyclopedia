There are other gimmicks as well.<br/>The boss is waiting for you on the last stage.<h3>Item</h3>As in many other breakout games, help items may appear under various conditions, giving you an advantage in the game.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Multi-capsule (red)</strong><br/>Fire another ball.<br/>The destruction efficiency of the block will be improved, but it will be difficult to keep the ball because there is also a collision detection between the balls.<br/>However, as long as there is one or more balls on the screen, even if you drop the balls into the abyss, it will not be a mistake.<br/><br/><strong>Defense Capsule (Blue)</strong><br/>Five defensive blocks will appear in front of the abyss to cover the ball falling into the abyss.<br/>Also, the speed of the ball hitting the defense block will slow down.<br/><br/><strong>Brake capsule (green)</strong><br/>The speed of one ball on the screen slows down.<br/>If there are multiple balls, the oldest ball will be the target.<br/><br/><strong>Score capsule (yellow)</strong><br/>If you take it, you will get a high score.<br/>This game extends with points and increases the stock of balls, so it is advantageous to get points.<h3>Warp</h3><br/>If you clear a specific stage, the \"warp\" that can be started from the middle stage will be lifted.<br/>It will be saved to disk.<h3>Suspend and resume</h3>If you pause and click the \"STOP THE GAME\" button during the game, a break save will be created and you will be returned to the title screen.<br/>If you press the \"RESUME\" button from the title, you can resume from the interrupted stage.<br/>However, when it resumes, the interrupted save will be discarded, the score will be 0, and 4 or more balls in stock will be discarded.<br/>Also, if you select \"START\" on the title screen, the interrupted save will be discarded.<h3>Interface</h3><br/>You can set the screen size and window, full screen switching, BGM and SE volume adjustment, difficulty setting (easy, normal, hard), and graphic quality.<br/>The settings are auto-saved to disk.<h3>Operation method</h3>Move the paddle left and right with the left and right mouse. (Cannot move up and down)<br/>Left-click to confirm the menu.<br/>Right-click to pause.<h3>Rule</h3>It will be cleared if you destroy all the blocks that should be destroyed in the stage.<br/>Indestructible blocks and some highly durable blocks will be cleared without being destroyed.<br/>If you drop the ball into the abyss, you will make one mistake and the ball will be consumed, and if the ball runs out, the game is over.<br/><br/>If the player is hit by the beam, it will be inoperable for a certain period of time, but just hitting the beam is not a mistake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T05:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df84e71a98100876ff869b1dcf8553b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["COPIKAL"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["COPIKAL"], "esrb_rating": null}
