{"id": 520404, "slug": "streets-at-midnight", "name": "Streets At Midnight", "name_original": "Streets At Midnight", "description": "<p><em>Streets At Midnight\u00a0</em>is a game heavily inspired by the Left 4 Dead series as well as the classic Call of Duty Zombies Game mode. Fight your way through the streets in the\u00a0<em>\"Escape!\"</em>\u00a0game mode, where you'll need to find random weapon pickups as you go! Hold out against wave after infinite wave of the living dead in the truly unoriginal \"<em>Survival</em>\" mode.</p>\r\nTwo game modes:\r\n<strong>Escape:</strong>\n<p>Fight your way through the streets (at midnight) to the escape helicopter! Use randomly generated weapon pickups along the way and do your best to survive! While there is only one map in this game mode, take your time and explore, it has been designed with multiple runs in mind.</p>\n<p>Note you start with two random weapon spawns in front of you. They can be really good (or really bad!).</p>\n<strong>Survival:</strong>\n<p>Kill wave after wave of zombies attempting to break into your fortifications. Use\u00a0points to buy various guns, or take a roll on the Mystery Box\u00a0Crate! Your doom may be inevitable, but try to take as many un-dead out with you as possible!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>These can also be found in game in the pause menu.</p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keybind</strong>ShootLMBAimRMBSprintShiftChange Fire ModeXJumpSpaceCrouchCtrlReloadRInteract/Weapon PickupEMoveWASDPause\r\nEscape\r\n<ul><li>You can adjust sensitivity in the pause menu.</li><li>Additionally green lights represent weapon pickups so you can see them in the dark.</li><li>Vsync is currently enabled by default.
