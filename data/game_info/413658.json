Our goal was to make a game that could teach people about the difficult decision-making process during a virus outbreak. Our initial though was to create a game that was about vaccines but we realized it was a challenging goal for the time we had. Instead we pivoted a bit and still, conveyed out true message that learning can be fun.</p>\n<p>While making this we learned a lot and had a lot of fun. Everything in the game was created by us in the last 24 including all of the graphics. We are proud of what we accomplished during HackMit 2019.</p><p>Creators: Greg Peterson and Charity Midenyo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/700/700b0ebde54c0d2a9bcf7851291717b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MegabyteManta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
