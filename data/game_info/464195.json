You now have to escape the dungeon without being killed by monsters, or magic.</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move, mouse to look.</p>\n<p>The rainbow spiral is a sheild that only protects from your own magic, didn't have time for the tutorial process lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e94/e9492b2777a420a38166395fa667ebbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsBridger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
