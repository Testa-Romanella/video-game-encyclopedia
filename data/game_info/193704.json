{"id": 193704, "slug": "simon-doesn-say", "name": "Simon Doesn' Say", "name_original": "Simon Doesn' Say", "description": "<p>Simon Doesn't Say is an audio only game based off of the popular electronic memory skill game Simon created in 1978 where the player has to repeat a series of colorful button presses in order. Instead of colored buttons this game uses different voices saying different directions with each voice being associated with a direction (Up, Down, Left, and Right) but capable of saying each direction. In there lies the twist in that you are trying to repeat the order of the voices and not what the order that the voices say. For example the Down Voice might say Up but you have to hit Down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: To give answers and hear the different voices inbetween rounds</li><li>Shift: Hear the Instructions in between rounds.</li><li>Literally Any Other Key: Start the next round.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This was made as a final project for my Audio for Digital Games Class. All sounds where either recorded myself or gotten from https://freesound.org/\u00a0and were listed as Creative Commons 0.\u00a0 Special thanks to the voice actors who let me use there voices for this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/736/736cb8660ef6e7472a722d49944b9cce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jack G"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
