You have just won a Virtual Adventure Vacation on Eternam, the biggest and best planetary Funpark in the galaxy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHard working intergalactic Space Marshals like yourself deserve to experience the ultimate gateway. Travel through 3D landscapes to more than a half-dozen past human eras, populated with life-like-bio=tech creatures offering tongue-in-cheek remarks. From the age of the pharaohs and the realm of medieval knights to the French Revolution and beyond, you'll have the adventure of a lifetime...or several.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut, Mister Jonz, there is a slight problem... Dragoons still inhabit Eternam wanting to reclaim the park and have joined forces with your arch-rival Mikhal Nuke. They plan to ruin your vacation in a big way!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt least you can count on help from the beautiful Tracy, a technician on the Eternam coordination team. Unfortunately, to escape Nuke's evil clutches,, she has dematerialized into the Funpark's computer network, so Tracy will communicate only via a computer screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou'll need intuition, courage, wit, diplomacy, charm and a surreal sense of humor. Only you can save Eternam - and yourself. But who wouldn't face all challenges to win Tracy's smile. So...Enjoy your vacation, Mister Jonz!", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d3/6d3fc9244fe8d9c1edb075817a20eceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 179, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Infogrames", "Infogrames Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Infogrames", "Piko Interactive", "Classics Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
