The problem however is that he won't always go after the cheese <em>you </em>placed. He will try to eat booby trapped cheese as well, and trying to get the mouses attention will be a problem.</p>\n<p>That is not all. If he eats too much cheese, he will die from overeating, and the cats will eat what is left of him.</p>\n<p>Did I say there were cats too? Not good...</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: This game contains screamers and is not for the faint of heart.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56d/56daada621863ff343823fee37785ea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kreastricon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
