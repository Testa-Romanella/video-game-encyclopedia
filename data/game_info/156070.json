{"id": 156070, "slug": "tetra-jump", "name": "Tetra Jump", "name_original": "Tetra Jump", "description": "<p>Tetra Jump is a casual but challenging infinite jumper. It is physics based, so you got to use the most of your reflexes and physics intuition to jump precisely without running out of charges.</p><p>The ball usually stores up to 3 charges which can be used to jump, even in the air. In order to keep going up, you have to recharge it by hitting the colored bricks. After a certain height, you start earning coins, which can be used to buy items, balls and themes in the store.</p><p>BRICK TYPES:</p><p>GREEN: the normal type of brick. These don't react to collisions.</p><p>RED: react to collisions and fall once you touch them.</p><p>PINK: elastic, can make you bounce really high, but be sure to hit them from above or face the consequences !</p><p>BLUE: swap a charge: if they're charged and you hit them, you steal a charge from them. If they're discharged, they steal a charge from you !</p><p>GOLD: gives you coins when you hit them</p><p>There is also spinning and fast falling bricks.</p><p>POWER-UPS:</p><p>SAW: transforms the ball into a circular saw that rotates around bricks, fully recharging.</p><p>APPLE: transforms the ball into an apple which falls upwards.</p><p>ROCKET: transforms the ball into an awesome rocket.</p><p>POTATO: transforms into a flying potato which gives double coins and has infinite charges</p><p>more soon.</p><p>ITEMS: The items are single-use power-ups including a rocket and a slow motion. You can buy a lot of those but only one can be used per game.</p><p>BALLS: You can buy balls with different effects and qualities, such as bouncyness, friction, and there's also a SHURIKEN that can stick to bricks if you touch and hold.</p><p>THEMES: Those only change the look of the bricks.</p><p>More stuff is to be added in the store, keep your game up to date !</p><p>There are three difficulties available: EASY, OK and NOT OK and separate HI SCORES for each one of them. You earn coins a lot faster if you play a harder difficulty !</p><p>Soon on iOS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad849be603d2f12cdc2b8c7e714498b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lumni"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
