Every match you make, you add to your timer, and <strong>subtracts </strong>from your opponents timer.\u00a0</p>\n<em>And </em>everything speeds up!\r\n<p>That's not all! The game gets more hectic as it goes on. At first, matching doesn't detract from your opponents' time, a chance\u00a0to rack up extra time. When you make a match, there's a split second before the match registers and the pieces disappears. This buffer shrinks as the game goes on, the AI makes faster moves and matching detracts more time from your opponents as the game goes on.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd5f3c4ac2459ec75a0d48c79f6590c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SyFySkyE"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
