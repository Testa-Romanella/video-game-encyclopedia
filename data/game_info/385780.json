Bring it\u00a0food and oxygen so it can survive. And look! Over there is another box with a tree, full of apples. Connect the two boxes and transport apples and oxygen from the tree to the pig. At the same time, bring water and carbondioxide back. Thus, you form a sustainable loop. Animals and plants living together, each producing what the other needs.</p>\n<p>Over the course of eight levels you build more and more complicated networks connecting plants and animals. In later levels you use your farm products to bake delicious pies, and even examine what happens to the food and\u00a0 oxygen inside your body!<br/></p>\n<p>During this early development phase, you can get this brilliant game on a name-your-own-price basis. If you donate $5.00 or above, you will be entitled to a free upgrade to the full\u00a0 game, once it's finished.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99c/99c75136f141eee721e839f58e837ed4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Helixsoft.nl"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
