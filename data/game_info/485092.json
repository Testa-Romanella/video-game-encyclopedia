When these <strong>cyber violence</strong> continue to escalate, the consequences often exceed the incident itself, and even more stressful and end precious lives.<br/>Therefore, we decided to develop such a game related to the theme of \"<strong>hacking</strong>\", \"<strong>cyber manhunt</strong>\" and \"<strong>privacy data leakage</strong>\". We hope that players can <strong>play the role of a hacker</strong>, and find out their <strong>privacy secrets</strong>, like God controls the destiny of others behind his back and witnesses their end. I hope that through this process, players can think and make their own right judgments.<br/><strong><h3>Features</h3></strong><br/>Implemented some cyber manhunt means and integrated them into our game:<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Web search</strong><br/>The player collects basic information about the target object through the browser search function.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Database</strong><br/>Use known information to enter into the database. After filtering, perhaps other information about the target object.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Crack</strong><br/>Generate passwords based on the obtained target person information, and use it to log in to accounts on various platforms (including email, social platforms, chat software, etc.)<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Disguise</strong><br/>Obtain the needs, social circles, etc. of the target object, choose disguise according to the information, and get more information by contacting the target object<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Chat Routine</strong><br/>After adding the target object as a friend, perform a chat Routine to get information.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Picture Analysis</strong><br/>Get valuable information and relevant clues from pictures.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Phishing</strong><br/>Send phishing links to invade the target person's hardware devices (computer, mobile phone), and obtain private information.<br/><br/>More advanced cyber manhunt methods will be unlocked later!<br/><strong><h3>Gameplay</h3></strong><br/><strong>\u00b7Highly Immersive</strong><br/>The player plays a hacker in the game, accepts the commission of a company, and completes cyber manhunt incidents.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Rich Gameplay</strong><br/>There are a lot of Social Engineering features in the game, also include Reasoning, Tracking, Puzzles-Solving, Destroying and Invading etc..<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Complex Story</strong><br/>The game will judge the good and evil of the player's behavior. Different judgments will trigger the corresponding plot direction.<br/><br/><strong>\u00b7Multiple Chars</strong><br/>There are many characters on the stage who has its own personality characteristics and unknown stories. You play a hacker to discover the truth of the incident one by one.<br/><strong><h3>Summary</h3></strong><br/>When we first decided on the theme of the game, we also considered it for a long time. Because of the better independent games such as <strong>This War of Mine</strong>, <strong>Papers, Please</strong> and <strong>Orwell</strong> etc., we also want to make a game that allows players to think outside the game. Therefore, in terms of subject matter, I also racked my brains.<br/>And in order to give players a real hacking experience, we even established a social engineering group to find some professor in the industry and ask them about social engineering. I even read the book <strong>The Art of Deception</strong> by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick, and saw how the real hacker master works. These online and offline learning directly opened the door to a new world for everyone in our team. The disciplines involved include social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, tactics, etc. The rich content also allows us full of confidence in the subject matter and gameplay of the game.<br/>Not just professionals and books, we are also looking for inspiration in some film works. For example, through <strong>Who Am I: No System Is Safe</strong>, we have seen more artistic and more representative forms of hacking technology. Through <strong>Searching</strong> we have learned how to create reversals in details and how let the audience / player focus on where we expect them to focus. Every part of the learning has benefited us a lot, and we can't wait to use them in our games.<br/><br/>To sum up, this game is very <strong>special and unique</strong> which combines a lot of features. I really hope that you guys could like this game much.
