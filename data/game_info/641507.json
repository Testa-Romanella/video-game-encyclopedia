The game is a top-down perspective shooter with a short storyline and different endings depending on the player's score.</p>\n<p>Contributors:<br/>Katcorn: Concept artist, menu screen image, co-writer<br/>Auer Felix, Fenec: Playtesting and feedback<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:48:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969d7c251c0677c04cc9cdede490f89d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Verburner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
