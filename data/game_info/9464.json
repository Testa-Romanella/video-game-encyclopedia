It can take from a few minutes up to even several hours! An example? The dismal statuette used in the video takes about 1 hour on an i7, 8GB ram notebook with a Quadro card. We have a trial version you can use so you can make your own tests before buying, but feel free to contact us if you want some clarifications!<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Q: Which file formats can Zephyr export to?<br/><br/>A: Zephyr Lite can export to PLY , OBJ/MTL and STL.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Q: Does Zephyr support 3D printing out of the box?<br/><br/>A: The output, while ready for 3D printing, might need some adjustments in your 3D printer's software.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Q: Are there limits in 3DF Zephyr Lite, compared to the Pro edition?<br/><br/>A: Yes, most notably you'll be limited to 200 pictures per projects (which are a lot!) and up to 1 nVidia card for GPU processing. For a more in depth feature comparison, feel free to check our website. However, remember that the core technology is the very same.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Q: How should i take pictures ?<br/><br/>A: The better the picture quality, the better the results. Obviously a DSLR camera works better than a phone camera, but you can get results even with reasonably cheap hardware. Please note that reflective and transparent surfaces might be a problem, which sometime can be solved in the way the pictures are shot, and sometimes they can't. In our free tutorials, we tackle this issues and we are always ready to take a look at your dataset if you have doubts.
