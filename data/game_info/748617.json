There are upgrades and tools in the shop to help you push back.<br/><br/>How long will you last before the weeds take over your farm? How much money will you have by then?<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Pay attention to your plants\u2019 condition. To get the most money for a plant you will have to harvest it just in time.

Once the weeds grow out of control and start becoming thick, it will be much more difficult to get rid of them.<br/></li><li>Invest your hard earned cash on Fertilizers, Herbicides, upgrades and better tools.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T03:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a8969dba63b0b080199f05ed3609bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hershul Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hershul Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
