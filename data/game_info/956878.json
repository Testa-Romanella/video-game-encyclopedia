Your goal  is to manage your farm by completing various tasks such as watering,  taking care of animals, and fishing.    </p>\n<p>But beware, every action you take has a side effect that can either benefit or harm your farm. For example, taking care of flowers will surely attract bees, a fed donkey will definitely not forget about the last dinner,\u00a0caught mice can attract cats and\u00a0chopping trees will piss off the beavers!\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game is designed to be played using only arrows and return keys,  making it simple and accessible for all players. It has been tested on  Linux and WASM, and it's recommended to play on the Linux platform for  the best experience :-)\u00a0.    </p>\n<p>As you progress through the game, you will encounter unexpected  challenges and events that will test your farming skills and  decision-making abilities. Will you be able to manage your farm  effectively and overcome the side effects of your actions?
