It's an arcade game rewarding good reflexes and dexterity.<br/><br/>To reach the end of each level in <strong>Gamut</strong>, you will have to navigate between platforms and fight ennemis. You control a character equipped not with a sword or a whip, but a <strong>paint brush</strong>. With this brush, you can make strokes of primary colors : blue, yellow and red. In the demo, the enemies and interactive objects will come in those <strong>primary colors</strong> but in future levels, who knows... <strong>Beware</strong> not to use the wrong color! <br/></p>\n<p>The demo contains 4 levels. Most of the graphical and audio assets are placeholders. Using a gamepad is highly recommanded as the game is barely playable with a keyboard.</p>\n<p>Gamut was made using GameMaker. This is my very first game. <strong>Any amount of feedback will be highly appreciated.</strong></p>\n<p>Have\u00a0fun!<br/><br/><br/>Gamepad controls available ingame.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard controls:<br/>WASD = move<br/>Space = jump/select<br/>J = blue stroke<br/>I = red stroke<br/>L = yellow stroke<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Known bugs (august 2019):<br/>- lifebar going haywire after getting hit.<br/>- moving platform not starting if the player jumps off immediatly after landing.<br/>- music not resuming after unpausing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6021593628de723384adbb46e69e3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zubaran"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
