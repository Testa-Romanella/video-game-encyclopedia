A man called Strong Bad.\n    </p><p>\n      As the star of the Homestar Runner web cartoons, Strong Bad has been \n      answering emails (in boxing gloves), pranking his friends, pummeling his \n      enemies, and making people with questionable taste snort milk out of \n      their noses for years now. And he's branched out to star in Strong Bad\u2019s \n      Cool Game for Attractive People, a monthly 5-episode series.\n    </p><p>\n      In Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner, when Strong Bad's plans to beat the snot \n      out of Homestar backfire, he ends up with an unwanted houseguest \n      cramping his style.
