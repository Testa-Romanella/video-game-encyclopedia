You will have to use the left and right keys to move the player around. If an enemy attacks you (touches you), the game will end and will show your score. If you win, of course, it will tell you that you won.</p>\r\nProblems that might happen...\r\n<p>Windows might think this app is dangerous, just like some other antiviruses. To run the program, click\u00a0<em>More Info</em>\u00a0then click\u00a0<em>Run Anyway</em>\u00a0or something closely related to that. Some antiviruses might interoggate it, but eventually will find no viruses in it. To prevent an antivirus\u00a0from suspecting the program everytime you run it, go into the antivirus app and make the app an exception, so it will run without interruptions. But even after doing that sometimes it might reload, but that won't change gameplay or cause any problems. So no need to worry.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d5781c20f47eb79c00176dcc3cccea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pythonsweet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
