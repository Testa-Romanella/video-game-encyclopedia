After stepping inside, the doors close behind you and trap you inside. Your task is to search for a way out.<br/><br/>This is a school project we worked on for about 6 weeks. The development is still ongoing, we try to add little stuff here and there, and maybe try to finish the product some day.<br/><br/>The gameplay is quite simple, you just click on what you want to examine, pick stuff up into your inventory (which can be opened from the backpack in the lower right), use stuff from your inventory either by clicking what you want to use and where, or by dragging the item onto what you want to use it on. Pretty simple and straight forward, although some puzzles may require you to think and read a little more.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>There will be additional builds in the future, right now the game can be played on Android and Windows platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5f23e0ad938c01ee2e262d6d19d6866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Slyse", "Leo V", "AnnaL"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
