The Aquarius only supports 72 characters per line, therefore there is a hard limit of 720 characters. I\u00a0created this game in 2019</p>\n<p><strong>Game Rules and Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The enemy invaders are trying to pass through your air space. You must not let the invaders pass. Using your fusion cannon, press any key to fire your laser beam towards the invader. You must be accurate! As the beam travels too fast for the human eye to see! The invaders will try and pass through your space at varying speeds, and from varying positions. Fire when you think that the invader is in line with your fusion cannon. If you hit him, he will explode in a red fiery ball of debris. If you miss, don't worry, the interference from your cannon will stop the invader, but will not destroy him. You will get more points for shooting the faster invaders. Once 20 invaders have tried to pass, your game will be over. Starting a new game will reposition your fusion cannon in a new location, and the battle starts once more! There is no time to waste! Lets go!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db5a64128e149f61c394e5c5b7e43bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loudscotsbloke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
