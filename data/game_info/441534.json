I recorded the entire development process, which did not go great... I spent easily 20 minutes, likely more, trying to solve a trigonometry bug while very tired. I tried to Google my way out of it but it was little help. I eventually solved the bug, but it ate up a TON of time, and unfortunately was not a bug I could leave in the game, lest it be unplayable---the bullets shot at the wrong angles, meaning you would shoot yourself in the face half the time which meant you would die instantly with the friendly-fire rules I wanted.</p>\n<p>I tried to add sound effects + music at the end, but I lost too much time to that bug and wasn't able to get them in.
