Different boxes move at different speeds. However, each metal box possesses a massive magnet that enables it to remain on any metal surface on command. (This is the main mechanic of the game.)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Content:</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game contains <strong>40\u00a0</strong><strong>meticulously crafted puzzle levels </strong>divided\u00a0into four\u00a0chapters, each featuring numerous gizmos and gadgets that must be navigated to reach the end. Each level also contains an elusive collectible to reward creative thinkers. Some levels test primarily platforming skills, while others are solely puzzle-based. In the platforming levels, when one box is destroyed, the level must be restarted. This is not the case for the puzzle levels. If you think any level is miscategorized, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Chapter completion times are recorded, so after exploring the entire game, you can test your speed as well. Your progress, times, and collectibles\u00a0are constantly saved, so you can always pick up right where you left off.\u00a0<strong><em>Warning:\u00a0</em></strong><em>The web version does\u00a0<strong>not\u00a0</strong>support saving or fullscreen. Treat it like a demo and download the game\u00a0if you enjoy it for all of the features.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<p>The controls are explained here as well as in-game:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Movement:\u00a0</strong>Arrow keys / WASD</li><li><strong>Jumping:\u00a0</strong>Up arrow key / W</li><li><strong>Magnetizing:\u00a0</strong>Down arrow key / S</li><li><strong>Exit to Title:\u00a0</strong>Escape</li><li><strong>Restart Level:\u00a0</strong>R</li><li><strong>Forward a Level:\u00a0</strong>Space</li><li><strong>Back a Level:\u00a0</strong>B</li><li><strong>Show Timer:</strong> T</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Development:</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game is still <strong>in development</strong>, so I would love feedback and criticism on every aspect of the game. The biggest glaring issue is that the\u00a0game by default has <strong>no audio</strong>, though it can be turned on in the Statistics menu. It's not good: you have been warned.</p>\n<p>The game is continually being updated (though not consistently) and is currently at version\u00a0<strong>beta 0.9</strong>. To see all versions of the game, visit my GitHub page. (Warning: the repository is\u00a0<em>very\u00a0</em>large.) The most recent version can be played in your <strong>browser </strong>here, and you can also download it for <strong>Windows</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Mac</strong>, and <strong>Linux </strong>(though I have not tested it for Mac and Linux).</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>- <em>Rochester X</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b32d22fc4031ee5e5f39158ed4f6d70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rochester X"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
