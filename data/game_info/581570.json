The powerups are located in the corner opposite of the door. But beware of the enemies! They will target you and try to eliminate you. There is no win screen, there\u2019s just a room at the end of the hall as a final challenge. After you\u2019re done with that room I suggest going backwards down the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Powerups:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>Bullets\r\n</li><li>Bouncing bullets\r\n</li><li>Double bullets\r\n</li><li>Shotgun bullets\r\n</li><li>Faster shotgun bullets\r\n</li><li>Faster bouncy shotgun bullets\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>How to play: Use the WASD keys to move, move your mouse to aim, and shoot with left click.\r\n</p>\n<p>The rooms alternate sides of the hallway. The further along the hallway the door is the more enemies there are, but also the better the powerup in the room.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want a challenge: it is possible to collect every powerup without losing any health and without killing any enemies.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b31/b31dfad1dc9f91c5775765cd10c24f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
