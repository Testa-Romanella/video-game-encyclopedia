But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules\u2026 <br/><br/>The game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It\u2019s a story about balancing freedom and dreams with circumstance and harsh reality. About growing up and finding out the true meaning of independence. Distancing itself from the judgmental simplicity of the original, Cinders tries to explore the more complex nature of oppression, responsibility and innocence. <br/><br/>With 120 decision points, over 300 options to choose from, and multiple endings, Cinders gives you total control over the main character\u2019s personality and how her story unfolds.LinksOfficial website<br/>Twitter<br/>Facebook<br/>Tumblr", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T19:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df5092c1fb16152125cd2fcb2db8df3.jpg", "website": "http://moacube.com/", "rating": 3.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 217, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 4, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Crunching Koalas", "MoaCube"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crunching Koalas", "MoaCube"], "esrb_rating": null}
