And meticulously designed shell casing physics. The highlight of the project is the squad AI system, which has the player's CPU teammates attempt to stay in formation and cover blind angles when in \"Follow\" mode, and can also follow player drawn lines while avoiding any obstacles in \"Command\" mode. Their accuracy and threat detection is also throttled just enough to keep the playthrough engaging.</p>\n<p>This is a concept I'll definitely be expanding on later. I will also revisit this particular project to sand down any particularly rough edges with a patch or two.</p>\n<p>__________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>[Real-Time Mode]<br/>WASD - Move<br/>LMB - Fire<br/>RMB - Tell teammates to follow you<br/>R - Press TWICE to reload (once to drop mag, once more to load)<br/>MouseWheel - Zoom -/+<br/>SPACEBAR to toggle Command Mode</p>\n<p>[Command Mode]<br/>LMB - Draw path for teammates to follow<br/>RMB - Recall teammates<br/>SPACEBAR to toggle Real-Time mode and execute plan</p>\n<p>__________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Patch Notes</strong></p>\n<p>1.0.2 (Hotfix)<br/>- Fixed UI icon for gun to more accurately represent equipped suppressor<br/>- Cleaned up placement of UI elements<br/>- Changed background color from default Unity blue to black for visual consistency<br/>- Further adjusted some targets to avoid clipping issues and pathfinding issues</p>\n<p>1.0.1 (Hotfix)<br/>- Fixed glaring clipping issues with some targets<br/>- Fixed non functional buttons on end screen<br/>- Fixed low resolution reload sprite<br/>- Rebaked 2D navmesh to hopefully reduce pathfinding issues</p>\n<p>1.0.0\u00a0<br/>- Original 12-14-20 Release</p>\n<p>__________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong><br/>- Teammate Follow mode occasionally wonky af<br/>- Targets/enemies always render on top of players until after theyre dead<br/>- Paths can be drawn on top of obstacles (but teammate AI can still navigate around)<br/>- Pathfinding to drawn paths occasionally breaks, toggle Follow via RMB to reset as a workaround<br/>- Can only make one line for both teammates to follow<br/>- Teammates have infinite ammo<br/>- Teammates do not shoot over short cover<br/>- Guns stick past walls</p>\n<p>__________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>@etkworks\u00a0- Programming and Design</p>\n<p>@Katoonist\u00a0- Art\r\n</p>\n<p>__________________________________________\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorials and Assets Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Coming Soon (After I've recovered from this all nighter)\r\n</p>\n<p>And probably a video too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:59:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca1afc46bbc6f6aace29aec85959b6c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ETK Works"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
