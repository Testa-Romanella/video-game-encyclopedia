{"id": 155905, "slug": "echo-heart", "name": "Echo Heart", "name_original": "Echo Heart", "description": "<p>A stealth-rhythm-arcade eat 'em up! Tap in rhythm to the heartbeats of the soldiers so you can sneak up on them and eat them! If you're out of sync, they'll hear you when you approach them and attack! The beat gets faster as play progresses.<br/></p>Arrows to move, SHIFT to beat to the rhythm.<p>DEV NOTES: <br/>This is a port of my first jam game, originally made for the Global Game Jam 2012. The theme was HEART.<br/><br/>It's a bit too mechanically shallow for extended plays (I may revisit it at some point and add a combo system or some such), but still acts as an entertaining diversion. It's also quite unique (and nonsensical). Enjoy!<br/><br/>NOTE: Some people may have problems hearing the heart beats through laptop speakers. Headphones are recommended if this happens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c8389e4977356c0e26b4e33183701a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
