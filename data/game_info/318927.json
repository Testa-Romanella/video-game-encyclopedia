These vital documents are all stored in briefcases, and it's the player's job to grab all of these and get out whilst avoiding any lasers and/or traps. Some lasers are actually a bit faulty, and only turn on when the security system detects a briefcase being picked up, whether it be an actual one or one of the trap briefcases set up within the level. Avoid being detected and grab the briefcases as you ascend out of the enemy base and return safely.</p>\n<p>This project was made using PuzzleScript, a free-to-use online game engine made specifically for creating puzzle games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f52f7dc6549ce432f267b33c4d97557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jacob Rogers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
