You can download the other zip if you want save files to work.<br/><br/>This is Missing Gears, it is a sidescroller roguelite in which you traverse a procedurally generated maze, trying to get stronger. Collect purple coins from enemies which stay with you even if you die, spend the gold coins on anything you find in the maze.</p>\n<p>I made this game for my college coursework in which you only got marks for the code and not any polish, but I still tried to make it as enjoyable to play regardless. I ended up getting 74/75 marks for this game, however there is no real end goal other than seeing just how much you can upgrade yourself. I don't currently have any plans to keep working on this game but it certainly was a very enjoyable experience and I wish to continue making other games.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game took inspiration from many others in the genre, such as Hollow Knight, Dead Cells and Hades just to name the main ones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T20:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f399de7b1ff41d85e3fc94787bb3c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zepht"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
