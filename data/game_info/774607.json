Shoot your way down and collect upgrades and curses\u00a0on the way. Though beware, as another far more deadly cascade of water follows close behind.</p>\n<p>Your primary mode of transport is your shotgun, its recoil sending you flying and bouncing off the walls. You can also hop by tapping A or D. Fill the green experience bar at the bottom and you'll level up, letting you choose from a selection of upgrades and curses. You've only a finite amount of space for these upgrades, and curses give you more space, so strike a good balance of what you can handle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD/ARROW KEYS -- Move/Aim shotgun</p>\n<p>SHOOT/Z -- Shoot shotgun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T23:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d7a047c27dbd73ed44269dc7465d4e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Henry Davis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
