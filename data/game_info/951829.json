Iris here~</p>\n<p><em>Tax Heaven 3000 </em>is a visual novel dating game that actually prepares your 2022 federal income tax return!\r\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always been a dream of mine to meet that special someone\u2026and file their tax return.\r\n</p>\n<p>Join me and we\u2019ll search for deductions while searching for love!\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful! We\u2019re not alone. Most wealthy countries make tax filing free, if the burden of preparation is even passed along to individuals at all. But, corporate tax filing services are (by dint of extensive lobbying) predatory, parasitic bottlenecks that deliberately complicate the tax filing process in order to make it unnavigable by ordinary people.\r\n</p>\n<p>And it works! The villainous corporation that controls the government from the shadows is a sadly mundane reality. It\u2019s the most boring industry imaginable.\r\n</p>\n<p>Videogames are, at the end of the day, pieces of software\u2013ontologically akin to Microsoft Word. <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> simply makes the fiction the point. For some reason the game-to-real-life interface has tended to remain the purview of corporate metaverse fictions. <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> is a dongle that adapts from a visual novel to the IRS.\r\n</p>\n<p>Come on, let\u2019s get started! I can already tell I\u2019m going to like you \u2665\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And remember,\u00a0If you die in the game you die in real life\u00a0if you prepare your taxes in the game, you prepare your taxes in real life.\r\n</p>\n<p>Suitable for single filers without dependents. <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> assists a player in creating a self-prepared United States federal income tax return.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p><em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> is designed to prepare 2022 US federal income tax returns for single filers without dependents.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Tax Heaven 3000 does not support all tax situations, and may not check for all possible deductions and credits that could apply to your individual tax situation.
