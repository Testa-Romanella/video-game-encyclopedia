CeCe (or Carbon Capture) is a game about collecting CO2 as it is pumped into the air, using your mouse and a variety of tools, the net, the hoover, and the fan! Be careful though, those traps will hurt the butterflies!\u00a0Try to survive for as long as possible!</p>\n<p>We had an absolute blast making this game, and we are brimming with ideas on where we could take it next and what features we can add. Some examples of ideas that didn't make the final cut, to name but a few:</p>\n<p>- A potted plant that captures carbon, and grows into a tree that will give you an extra life!</p>\n<p>- Butterflies and birds that can get caught in your carbon traps, forcing you to mix up your strategy!</p>\n<p>- Trap upgrades, like traps being able to hold more carbon, size upgrades, and more!</p>\n<p>- Multiple levels with different layouts and obstacles!</p>\n<p>Thanks very much for reading and playing, please feel free to leave us some feedback in the comments!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Carbon Capture for Climate Action Game Jam, hosted by Abertay University, and sponsored by SSE Thermal. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T07:35:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/466555046c5b3a3f7db501a24b1ad3d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poisonbiscuts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
