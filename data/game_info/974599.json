Help her remember the songs by playing the right notes at the right time!<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this frenetic rhythm game, try to chain together as many songs as possible from over 70 songs spread across 4 different levels. The songs play randomly, and each mistake costs you a life. In each session, you have 4 lives, and you must complete as many songs as possible, making sure your life doesn't drop to zero. Completing each song in its entirety earns you an extra life.<br/>A training mode is also available for you to practice playing some of the more challenging songs. Good luck!<h3>Content:</h3><ul><li> 70+ songs<br/></li><li> Each game is unique!<br/></li><li> Songs are shuffled in every game<br/></li><li> Various music styles from the 80s and 90s: EDM, lo-fi, chiptune, synthwave, vaporwave, pop-punk...<br/></li><li> Training mode to improve your skills</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T05:39:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/2536014dd121b691f74e2c822ff80e7f.jpg", "website": "https://www.flocons.studio/tinyjukebox", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flocons Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flocons Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
