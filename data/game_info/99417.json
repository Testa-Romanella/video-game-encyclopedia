One more thing, it only fires once before it's exhausted. The player will face a gauntlet of hostility in an attempt to make their way to the escape pod and off the ship. </p><p>Team:</p><p>Rachel Cronk-Concept/Art/Animation</p><p>Bryce Maciel-Art/Animation</p><p>Victor Burgos-Programming/Systems Design</p><p>Zakar Keosayan-Level Design/Environment Art</p><p><strong><strong>***Update 2/23/16***</strong></strong><br/></p><ul><li>Keyboard Controls have been added</li></ul><p><strong><strong>***Update 2/20/16***</strong></strong><br/></p><ul><li>Laser sight (Hold L Trigger and move Right Stick</li><li>Updated art (Moving background and materials)</li><li>Added effects to elemental projectiles</li><li>Scripted elemental puzzles (not in game til next build)</li></ul><p><strong><strong>***Update 2/19/16***</strong><br/></strong></p><ul><li>New sounds</li><li>Added collision and effects to projectiles when they hit floors and walls</li><li>Revisited escape pod ending sequence</li><li>Renovated ending menu</li><li>Added Game Over menu</li></ul><p><strong>***Update 2/17/16***</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed puzzles in the first map</li><li>Added enemies</li><li>Replaced all cells with cell doors the player may open with a chance of finding items so hit those lock panels!!</li><li>Renovated title screen and pause menu</li><li>Updated UI</li></ul><p><strong>Focus for future updates:</strong></p><ul><li>Add in all elemental puzzles</li><li>Add new enemies and NPC's with short quests</li><li>Enable weapon to destroy enemies</li><li>Insert lore and potential expansion to new levels</li><li>Finish adding frames to player character animation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d97acca673fd36b573ff0575003cce8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thenegaverse"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
