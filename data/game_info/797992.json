In this dream, Sigmund must avoid his id; represented by demons, symbolizing his primitive and instinctual drives. Throughout the endless run, he encounters the super-ego; represented by collectible angelic wings. He needs to collect these wings as they operate as his moral conscience. In this game, Sigmund doesn\u2019t know why he is having this dream or the meaning behind it; all he knows is that he needs to keep running whilst avoiding obstacles set by the id and collect his superego. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T04:45:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3efd81402be36dcefb785c90163a55e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarah Abd El Halim"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
