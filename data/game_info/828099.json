You may occasionally be asked to delete or enter text.</em></p>\n\n<p><em> Open text files and read them. You will navigate through folders and files to move forward through the story. When prompted, you can type an X, or delete something, or save a file. When you finish reading each text file, just quit it. You can save if you want. (Note: It is recommended to open the actual text files instead of just reading them in the preview so that you can properly get the layout of the ASCII text). Move through folders, reading and navigating and finding your way. Gameplay is approximately 15 - 20 minutes. <br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>AVOID DRONERS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>2015, revisited 2020<br/></p>\n<p><em>Has been tested on Mac and Linux but not Windows.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T16:07:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/755704d4b2e9b0ba7231f6e420b2c238.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["notapipe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
