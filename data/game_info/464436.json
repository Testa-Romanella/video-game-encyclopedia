Made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam.</p><p>Explore the symbiotic relationship between a collective group of Jellies and a solitary Beast as you traverse a nomadic landscape and witness the cycle of life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Jellies are under your control, and their primary focus is to gather food to satiate the Beast\u2019s enormous appetite. As the Beast is fed, it will produce more Jellies, as well as grow in size and maturity. If the Beast is not properly fed when it is hungry, it will become petulant, and get into a frenzy, harming both friend and foe alike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although it has a mind of its own, the Beast may be ridden and directed when it is well-fed and content. It is also strong enough to take on the various hostile Gremlins scattered across the land, as well as break certain terrain elements.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to maintain a balance of control between the Jellies and the Beast.\u00a0</p><p>-----</p><p>Art by Jesse Wang\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/j.ddubs/</p><p>Music by BB Tombo\u00a0https://twitter.com/bbtombo</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/bbtombotunes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/001deb708339435695c47c1aac04f5d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clarkwu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
