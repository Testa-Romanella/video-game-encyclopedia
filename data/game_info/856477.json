Most other sprites are from Kenney but edited by me in Aseprite. SFX are various free use sound effects from OpenGameArt and itch.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T06:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4ab51b4c67c56be2c3a243a651b4cd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["HappySlice"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
