But this hermit crab has a problem : He's about the aproximate size of a truck. So, in order to find a new home, he needs to go to the city.</p>\n<p>Thing is, he's so big he pretty much breaks everything in his path. Which, at some point, breaks the newfound house on his back. <br/></p>\n<p>Beware : He cannot survive for long outside of his shell ! If the house you're in breaks, you'll need a new one fast ( and in good state )</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys and the space bar to play. To get in a house jump on top of it (it must be in good state).<br/></p>\n<p>The further and faster you go, the higher your score !<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made during the Global game jam of 2019, in two days, by a team of three people :\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Hugo Malezieux : Visual Arts</p>\n<p>- Ambroise Durand : Programming</p>\n<p>- Antoine Tirmarche : Music / Sound Design<br/></p>\n<p>( we took some days after that to fix some bugs and tweak the sound )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T06:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/898/89881ca2d3f8f72ebeb920c67f73f94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dentelin", "Damoone"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
