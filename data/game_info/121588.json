Suddenly, the time machine he's working on goes beserk, then disappears. It seems the machine he was building is now tearing apart the fabric of time. Portals start appearing that connect to other times, including the Cretaceous period, the Ice Age, and pirate times. You can enter the different eras and explore, but hostiles from each of these periods can emerge to fight you as well. Your mission: enter the portals, find the missing time machine, and destroy it before shatters time itself.</p>\n<p>This is built as a mod for T-Engine4, but can be downloaded and installed as a standalone game.<br/></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please report them using the Github issue tracker.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c11/c11e3337ef7b2e5d7b9dcf40fdc49db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["chaosdev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
