Notice objects in this world or discern a foundation in it.  To choose.  Not to choose.  Accident or cruelty.  Mercy or coincidence.  Music.  Screams.  Overcome or substitute.  Imaginary cities or a mirror of loneliness.  Executioner and victim, at least.  They are close.  They almost communicate, even if they delegate to doubles.
