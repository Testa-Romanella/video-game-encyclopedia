It means that the computer does not only act following the rules of the road but also takes some other techniques taken from real life, for example, gives a sign that passes the driver to the main road.</p>\n<p>The time in the game is slightly different from the real time (1 minute in the set corresponds to five-ten seconds of real time). The driver can drive in total for 11 hours, after that he needs to go to the nearest Parking to make a nine-hour rest. If you do not, the driver gradually begins to struggle with sleep and yawn. The screen becomes dark, and the player, in turn, loses control of the truck, what can quickly lead to an accident.</p>\n<p>In the game, there are temporary and permanent road signs that limit the speed mode. The maximum speed of all trucks in the game is technically limited to 90 km/h by default (but it can be disabled in the game settings).</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2012-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:51:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1f5/1f5ddf7199f2778ff83663b93b5cb330.jpg", "website": "http://eurotrucksimulator2.com/", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 119, "owned": 4764, "beaten": 254, "toplay": 37, "dropped": 467, "playing": 183}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 79, "ratings_count": 846, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 852, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SCS Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SCS Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
