They observe you, from the corner of your little bedroom.</p>\n<p>Close your eyes.</p>\n<p>If you don't see them, they don't see you.</p>\n<p>But here the imagination runs free, the figures swell up, they become creatures, monsters, they move, they approach. The pulse increases, the shadows are creatures and the creatures are shadows. You cannot escape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Open your eyes.</p>\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>'(Don't) Blink' is a very short game developed as part of the 'Game-A-Week' module of my bachelor degree course in Game Design.
