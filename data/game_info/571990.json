Bigger fuel payloads and higher impact velocities will drain a larger amount of velocity from planets - but be mindful of the amount of fuel you are using when getting to your destination, and of the other planets that are trying to do the same!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b56bef25bca1fc7a3a052bc1c18bff6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Francesco"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
