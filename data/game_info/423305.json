So far you can interact with your environment immensely, and that will be a big part of the game. You can pickup/throw objects, breaking fragile objects. You can play basketball, and explore the house. You can also mow the lawn, which gets you experience points. Later on, experience points will be used to unlock other features. Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d84665168339213ac688111972d9f33f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiko"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
