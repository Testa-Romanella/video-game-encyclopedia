Say no more! ISLANDERS should be right up your alley.<br />\nISLANDERS is a minimalist strategy game about building cities on colorful islands. Explore an infinite number of ever-changing new lands, expand your settlements from sprawling villages to vast cities and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere.<br />\nIf you\u2019re thinking about buying ISLANDERS please keep in mind that we are a very passionate but small team of three.

You start with a set of buildings in your inventory that you can place on your island. Placing buildings is rewarded with points. The amount of points you get depends on what surrounds the buildings when you place them. Gather enough points to refill your inventory and unlock new buildings.<br />\nOnce your city is big enough you may choose to travel to the next island (they are generated procedurally, so you can literally keep exploring forever). If you run out of buildings the game ends. This is where you high five yourself for beating the high score, take a proud last glance at the epic city you&#39;ve built and start just one more round...</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T14:07:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a62fb9a34ba7d37b87679387beabc970.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 887, "beaten": 88, "toplay": 64, "dropped": 70, "playing": 24}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 64, "ratings_count": 177, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 180, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Coatsink", "Stage Clear Studios", "GrizzlyGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coatsink", "GrizzlyGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
