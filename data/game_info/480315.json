The falling objects are made of two shapes each(An outer Circle having\u00a0 a\u00a0 smaller inner circle /triangle/square completely onside it)and they can be destroyed only when the shuriken circumference will lie between the two shapes of falling objects\u00a0 ( the shuriken is completely inside the outer circle and the inner shape of falling object is completely inside the\u00a0 shuriken circumference ) .</p>\n<p>This is my first game as an indie game developer. I have made this game just for learning and applying my game development knowledge . I am a beginner in this field and I do not have much experience. I am now learning game art to improve the look of the game . I know that game art is not good . I have just implemented my idea in a project and now I will improve this by learning some skills. But what you think of the game play. Is it interesting? Should I put my time in improving this game or not? with improve art does it will become interesting or it is a boring game which can't be improved?<br/>Let me know in the comment section.</p>\n<p>SHOW LESS\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Controls:-</p>\n<p>Use arrow buttons\u00a0 on the screen to move the player left and right and to stretch out the shuriken (ninja star) hold your finger on the screen in between the arrow buttons.</p>\n<p>Credits;-</p>\n<p>Background music and sound effects from PlayOnLoop.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be8d53cb9a18121d14ac0b4e38cf9ffc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mohamad655"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
