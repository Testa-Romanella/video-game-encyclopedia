You will explore the island at your own pace and find side quests which you can complete in order to learn more about the island, its inhabitants and external forces acting on it. Each quest is unique, play various mini-games and think outside of the box in order to complete all 40+ quests available.<br/>(Most of the game can be played with a controller but various menu items may not be fully functional when using a controller.)<br/><br/>You are a nameless soldier from mainland Japan who is sent to aid the Japanese navy in the invasion of Urajiosutoku (Modern day Vladivostok), but your journey does not go as planned and you wash up on the shores of Nayoshu- an island not well known to most form the mainland. Here, you will find a power struggle in progress between the indigenous Ainu people and a mainland clan intent on establishing their presence. You will interact with both sides and learn about the strange circumstances which seem to have kept this island paused in time.<br/>Strange things are happening; ships can not leave nor enter the island leaving it lacking supplies, there are no new births here and none on the island seem to be able to die.<strong><br/>Art: <br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kurniawan67 - Main Art</li><li>Sato_Neet - AI Pixel-Art</li><li>Ainu Monyou - Ainu patterns and designs</li></ul>\n<p>With the exception of two menus, this game is entirely playable using a gamepad.<br/></p>\n<br/><strong>Required</strong><strong>Recommended</strong><br/><strong>Operating System</strong><br/>Windows 7 64-bitWindows 10 64-bit<strong>Processor</strong>Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or fasterIntel 9700k or AMD\u00a03700X\u00a0processor<strong>Memory</strong>8GB RAM16GB RAM<strong>Video Card</strong>NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higherNVIDIA GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 570 series card or higher<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T08:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b132dc6b8480c00d9d25f4728c9690e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schirwindt"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
