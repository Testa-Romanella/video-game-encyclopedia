The theme was \"Underworld\", so I took a shot at a creative 2d platformer. I ended up liking it so much that I'm now going to develop it into a full game, after the jam is done! Look forward to that. It'll be on my itch.io as well ;).<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>AD / Left-Right / Left Joystick: Movement<br/>W / SpaceBar / B / Circle / A / Up: Jump<br/>R / Select / -: Reset<br/>Esc / Start / +: Exit to menu<br/><br/>Best of luck.<br/><br/>-Samuel Clarke<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T05:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/611e7179337e9d9d62fd910f91f394d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["KingTide44"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
