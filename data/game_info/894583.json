What is life, grants death. What is lost, may be found...<br/><br/>Behold the Megalith: A city carved from the slag of worlds, heaving beneath its own weight and decrepitude, home to the many sins and rare virtues of humanity. Among them, a street urchin pockets the secrets of a dead man, a team of salvagers hunts a treasure from across the ages, and a young woman seeks to combat and contain the outbreak of a deadly disease, while politics and organised crime collide around her.<br/><br/>In time, their paths shall converge, and lead them out into the fire; across the seething waves of the Burning Sea, past pirate and storm, and far away to the Rim, to the edge of all charts... and beyond. <br/><br/>A six hundred page tale of nautical adventure, friendship, villainy, mystery and grim certainty.<br/><br/>Please Note: This product is a digital book, packaged and presented via a game engine. Its interactive elements are limited to book and menu navigation.<br/><br/>Includes .epub and .pdf versions!<br/><br/><strong>Sample the first hundred pages in the demo, along with samples of other upcoming works!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T06:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d9/4d9aab38061942d2140397d453ee0e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Brakespear"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Brakespear"], "esrb_rating": null}
