This is a concept release just to get something out there and give people an idea of the type of games to come soon. An updated version will come out with original hand drawn art, better music, and an optional story to follow. Moonstruck Technologies is also currently working on a 3D game. I hope you all enjoy!... Best experienced when played with an Xbox one controller.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T07:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fd428267a5b8632d86b46dd09b22f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moonstruck Tech"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
