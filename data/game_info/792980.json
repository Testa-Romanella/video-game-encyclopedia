Happiness is a rare commodity in this dreary cyberpunk dystopia. Faced with a ceaseless rain, it's up to a lone teru teru b\u014dzu to ward off the downpour. The only method being to platform up to\u00a0the top of\u00a0the labyrinthian amalgamation of various buildings that mars the skyline, and hang from the tallest eaves in the city.</p>\n<p>Can the future be saved? No, of course not. But perhaps, by your actions, you can help to provide some much needed sunlight to the disheveled masses.\u00a0Your mission--much like the lives of the struggling Neo New Kyotoites--will be short and difficult.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Move with the D-Pad. Hold the A button to charge your jump, release the A button to jump. It's really that simple.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T17:06:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/1227bbdfd681b5e1cf8722e273632097.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bownly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
