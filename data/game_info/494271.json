{"id": 494271, "slug": "quixotic-quest", "name": "Quixotic Quest", "name_original": "Quixotic Quest", "description": "<p>We're making Quixotic Quest, a free RPG game in which, unlike other RPGs, you try to save the world. Yoapan's being torn apart by the Black Hand, and its up to you to beat them, as only heroes can.</p>\n<p>Quick Start Guide (read before play):<br/>This is the alpha build, so it's probably really bad. I don't have that much experience with game design, and I'm still learning. Anyway, here are the controls:<br/>W/A/S/D move<br/>Space to jump, C to crouch<br/></p>\n<p>E to open/close menu<br/>Enter to interact with people<br/>Q to toggle free-look cam</p>\n<p>The demo ends when you fight the guards at the royal palace. To enter the royal palace you must complete Sans' quest and obtain \"Road block repellent\". Sans is located in a secret garden near the start of the game. The quest \"Glitch in the Matrix\" can be completed but you will not receive any rewards yet, this is intentional. Additionally, the glitched portal can not be entered yet. I'm still working on that dungeon.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Don doesn't use a traditional mana bar in fights, but uses something called \"Moxie\" instead. You can read more about it here: https://nnmgstudios.com/blog/8/2/20\u00a0</p>\n<p>Regarding fights, there are both static encounters that don't respawn and infinite random encounters, which work similar to Pokemon. The game will be balanced with the assumption that the player only completes the static fights. That way grinding is viable but not a necessity.\r\nLastly, here are some tips if you're struggling with fights:\r\nSpiders are really weak and can be instantly killed with \"Gambit\", even at level 1. As such, it's usually ideal to focus on them first in fights with multiple enemies.\r\nGambit does about 88% more damage than your standard attack, use this to your advantage.\r\nDon't be afraid to spam heal! Your moxie regenerates pretty quick, especially if there are a lot of enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T04:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba1d79751cc7c9c34cccfa1fcf8141a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yin4TheWin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
