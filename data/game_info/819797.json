In this game you play as a dice named nice (funny how that turned out) in his quest to find the golden dice in the one level this game has. Platform through dangerous obstacles, avoid fast but annoying enemies and gamble with your life through the checkpoints scattered all around the world (and by world I mean the one level this game has). Will you roll the dice on your life? or will you avoid these helpful markers in hopes to gain more lives? All this in more in Nice Dice Adventures\u2122 (Batteries not included)</p>\n\n<p>This is my first released Unity game, so please don't expect that much from it lol. I made this as a test of my knowledge and my game development skills (and it's made in 48 hours so you can say It'll not be that polished), and I hope some of you may find some enjoyment (or rage because I think I made some jumps hard) in this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d7647292b61760e8a53093dc5ba3b02d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SeanSS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
