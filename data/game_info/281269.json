When in main game use the arrow keys or click/touch (Mobile) the corners of the screen to move the character left/right. Avoid enemies, but grab the candy. Every candy = 50 points. Every 100 points you advance to the next Wave (which slightly increases enemy amount and speed).</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for giving the game a try!</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Mobile worked on Android, however IOS test did not work on the 1 device i tested on. Also on Mobile audio takes a while before it begins working (probably a cache issue?).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea985c02441c410e7cba77bb65c8242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelvengeance"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
