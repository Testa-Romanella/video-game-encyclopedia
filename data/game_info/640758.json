You got the graveyard shift for work.\u00a0</p><p>Watch over the cameras, investigate anything unusual. If everything looks clear at the location, return to the camera room and continue your shift.</p><p>This game was made for Callum Upton's game jam! The jam was held for 8 days, but due to circumstances, I only had about a day and a bit to get this game created. I still really wanted to join this jam, and I am very glad I did, it was a lot of fun! Just wish I had more time to polish everything, and add a bit more.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this little project.</p><p>Known issues:</p><p>Not many, just sometimes the doors need an extra E press to open.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:29:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b15b2212633556b0366192e1a4639d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BunBoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
