{"id": 725078, "slug": "sm-radio", "name": "SM RADIO", "name_original": "SM RADIO", "description": "<p>SM RADIO is a project created by\u00a0 Rodwin Malinga and Erik Prinz. The project is intended for mobile devices and turns your smartphone into a fictional radio.</p>\n<p>The SM RADIO is preloaded with 8 main radio stations and 2 hidden stations. All of these stations are fictional, and any similarities between them and places, names and events that truly exist are purely coincidental. The main stations are CCB Radio 1, CCB Radio 2, Ranch Radio, K-West SM, The Van SM, Graveshift SM, The Mailroom SM and Emerald City Radio. All the 8 of the main stations have been cowritten, directed and produced by Rodwin Malinga and Erik Prinz; each of these stations contain a fully voice acted narrative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The SM RADIO plays radio stations from a fictional city known as Silverport. Silverport exists in a universe that runs parallel to our own. So, the events in Silverport are similar to those here on Earth, however there are quite a number of key differences. Users can only interact with the SM RADIO for 20 minutes before the battery dies, and all of the radio stations play simultaneously. This means that participants will not be able to listen to all of the radio\u2019s content in one sitting.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9adbc670bcad73ac22bec8f1a85403c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["GearPunk Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
