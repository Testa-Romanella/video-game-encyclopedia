{"id": 15363, "slug": "tank-it", "name": "Tank it!", "name_original": "Tank it!", "description": "Tank it! is made to communicate a clear message: <strong>#WarKills</strong> <br/><br/>Tank it! is a realistic and bloody war simulation game designed to show how brutal and dangerous war really is\u2026 that it is no good... that countless civilians are killed as collateral damage. <br/><br/>In Tank it! you<strong> command a drone to remotely control a heavy tank</strong>. You receive the mission to travel to remote villages, <strong>find and destroy the target military camps and eliminate all terrorists</strong>. But as in real life, there are many civilians in the villages, as well. The terrorists and civilians alike are at the player\u2019s mercy. It is up to the <strong>player alone to decide</strong> how to handle this mission. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Bernd Geiblinger: \"I for one do not enjoy playing brutal, bloody games, so for me it is painful to create death animations and blood. I did everything else before I did this kind of work - but I am doing it for the message. This is also why Tank it! will be available for a very low value - For me it is much more important to spread the message of the game than to earn a great deal of revenue.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b5141c02aeac520436d53fc336a8f3e.jpg", "website": "http://tankit.bplus.at/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BplusGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OtakuMaker.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
