You will help them decorate the Christmas tree and receive gifts.<br/>\r\nEnjoy the Christmas spirit and play mini-games.<br/>\r\nThis is not your regular free-to-play match3 game. Laruaville has a lot of game mechanics you will not find in any other match3 game. It also has an exciting new story to follow, cute characters, a whole town to build and our own variation of Mahjong (in our opinion it\u2019s way more fun than the original game).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T02:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a57e7f20cf409890e4d786811d80c5e.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/lgtsia/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LGT SIA"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LGT SIA"], "esrb_rating": null}
