Use your wit and cunning to hold back Randy and his Dice-Men army!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The game starts immediately so you better act quickly! Below you is a standard roulette table. Left click to place down bets on each space to bet on what number or color the ball might land on. Once you've placed your bets spin the wheel and see if your prediction was correct! If it was correct you'll get double your bet back and a cigarette will be placed! These cigarettes will automatically puff smoke at the approaching Dice-Men so you better place a lot! They're your only defense! They die quickly after 10 seconds and if they are touched so get ready! You can also spend a little extra bet clicking on the towers giving them a boost. Don't let 3 Dice-Man get past you however, or its gameover for you! But be careful the power of the enemy is also a roll of the dice, so lets hope you get a good roll. You can accumulate a debt, but that's never good is it?\u00a0Aim for the highest score you can!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>Installation Instructions:\r\n</p>\n<p>1.
