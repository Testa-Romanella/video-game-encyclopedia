Throughout these levels you will have to freeze time, and switch characters to reach the purple win pads.

I had to make a game with a time freeze mechanic, multiple players, and a perspective change mechanic as part of the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>-WASD or arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>-Space to jump</p>\n<p>-\"E\" to switch characters</p>\n<p>-Tab or left shift to switch perspective</p>\n<p>-\"R\" to restart a level if my 100% glitchless game somehow breaks</p>\n\n<p>Art (if you would call it that), code, and sound effects by\u00a0me</p>\n<p>Music by Ecrett Music\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30f/30f30f0c3fe4d2ca8bd96ce042b24147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenBonk"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
