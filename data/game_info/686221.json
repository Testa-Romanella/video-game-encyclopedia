It\u2019s kind of exciting, to say the least. It\u2019s also the first time I\u2019ve really been motivated to make and finish a game.\r\n</li><li>I heard about this jam from someone on the Discord server for a game called Happenlance. It had a demo recently, it\u2019s out right now, and I loved the gameplay. Please play Happenlance.\r\n</li><li>The mechanics of this game are inspired by a flash game called IQ Ball. That game has physics puzzles where your grappling hook pulls things towards you. This one doesn\u2019t. In fact, the only physics involved here is the physics of your own character.\r\n</li><li> I wanted to record these notes myself and put them in the game. On one hand, that\u2019s a thing Bennett Foddy did, and it was pretty cool. On the other hand, that\u2019s a lot of time and I only started this game jam like half of the way in. I also wanted to put these notes in as TTS but I, joining halfway in, felt like I didn't have enough time for that either.</li><li>The song playing in the background is by Kubbi, an artist I really like. His music is under CC-BY, so no DMCA problems here! You may also have heard some of his other music from Ph1lza, Just Shapes &amp; Beats, and the game SNKRX.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c7dcf1ec52f272fa1bb71fa09565f26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["magpy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
