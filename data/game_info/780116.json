Collecting all 5 beetles before finishing each stage will let froggy go to a special bonus stage. There, froggy will find a big delicious dragonfly waiting at the end!</p>\n<p><strong>Game Controls (Keyboard)</strong></p>\n<strong>Z</strong><strong>Jump (in-game) / Confirm Selection\u00a0(menus)</strong><strong>X</strong><strong>Tongue (in-game)</strong><strong>Arrow Keys</strong><strong>Move Left &amp; Right (in-game) / Navigate (menus)</strong><strong>ESC</strong><strong>Pause Menu (in-game)</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Short and sweet, Little Frog Game is a simple platformer game created over the course of several months in Godot.\u00a0 All assets were all created by myself (music, SFX, art, etc), with some special thanks to some great tutorials, as well as all the friends and family who have supported me along the way.</p>\n<p>I hope to continue the adventures of little frog in a more robust game in the future, but for now I hope you enjoy this bite-sized adventure!</p>\n<p><strong>Original Soundtrack Also Available!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you'd like to support me or my music, the full soundtrack from Little Frog Game is available on my Bandcamp\u00a0(Click here!) as well as various streaming services.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you'd like to keep up with me or get in touch, you can follow me on Twitter or check out my official website below:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Twitter:\u00a0@JamphibiousFM\r\n</li><li>Website:\u00a0jamphibious.com</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits and Special Thanks</strong></p>\n<p>I would like to thank the following for their ongoing support of my endeavors:</p>\n<ul><li>My lovely wife Pollyana</li><li>My\u00a0friends and family</li><li>Scarlet Moon Discord Community</li><li>Heartbeast Discord Community</li><li>Something Classic Discord Community</li></ul>\n<p>Font credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Manaspace by codeman38</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to the following individuals/channels for their various art/code tutorials:</p>\n<ul><li>Heartbeast</li><li>BornCG</li><li>Brandon James Greer</li><li>Slynyrd</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Take care, and keep hopping along :)</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T08:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/485500b8df460e12114056179ce63282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamphibious"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
