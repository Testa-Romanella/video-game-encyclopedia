This is only the first public demo, and a lot of things will probably change in the final version, might even need an actual writer for it. Anyways I think there isnt much introductions to make since this is a fangame, just have fun.</p>\n<p>Oh and one important thing, this game has a discord where you can report bugs or give me feedback, and also if you wish to work in the project the server is the best way to get in contact.
