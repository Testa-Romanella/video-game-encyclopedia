It's purpose is to show the basic idea and receive early feedback from players.</p><p>Currently the game runs in Flash.</p><p>Please put a comment with your system specs and an average FPS. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Development plan:</strong><br/></p><p>It is going to be a simulation/sandbox/toy/maker of marble races. The game will let you select the track, theme and how many/what marbles are competing. Players will bet which marble makes it first to the finish line.</p><p>There will be several sets of marbles to choose race participants from.</p><p>The game will have a single race mode and a tournament mode with two variations - multi stage and brackets.</p><p>Built in track editor will let players create simple or complex tracks for the marbles. Tracks will feature obstacles, like fans for example.</p><p>The game will support up to 8 local players placing bets both in single race and tournament modes. No online multiplayer is planned.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p>1. Choose which marble will win.</p><p>2. Watch as your marble miraculously makes it first or gets pushed to the last place. Every race is different!</p><p>3. You can click anywhere on the screen to restart at any time.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong></p><p>The aim is to publish Marble Racing for Windows first - this includes Itch.io, Steam and GoG.</p><p>Later the game will arrive on Android, iOS and hopefully Mac OS X and Linux.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Programming and Art by <strong>Krzysztof Topolski | Ugly Pixels</strong> - http://uglypixels.pl</p><p>Music by <strong>David 'Senjan' Ketikidis</strong> - https://soundcloud.com/senjan-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/ddad497a8a3481953a5b7bca34b23b5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ugly Pixels"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
