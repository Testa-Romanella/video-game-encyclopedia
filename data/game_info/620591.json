There are 2 players that can be controlled with the controls below.\u00a0 Over time the screen will scroll upwards and you must stay within the bounds of the screen to keep going. Platforms will be randomly generated and you can control both players to jump onto them. An enemy will also be randomly spawned and can kill the player upon collision. To defeat these enemies the players must use the string binding them to do so. This string will kill any enemy it touches. You can play this game alone, but playing with a friend in local co-op multiplayer might make it easier.\u00a0This game is a submission to the 2021 GMTK Game Jam and I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Player 1: A and D to move, W to jump.</p>\n<p>-Player 2: Left and Right to move, Up to jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/953/953810fa42f6486d0818c05e7d80f37d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Reach_Mayo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
