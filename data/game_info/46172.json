Victory is achieved once you have created obstacles around the bot player in the way so he can not make further moves. You can choose the hexagon onto which you wish to move by simply clicking on it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLevels get harder and harder and the hexa bot gets more and more difficult to block!
