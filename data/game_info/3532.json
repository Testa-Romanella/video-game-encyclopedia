{"id": 3532, "slug": "singstar", "name": "SingStar", "name_original": "SingStar", "description": "<p>SingStar is a singing game, distributed for free for PlayStation consoles. The series has been going on for 14 years already, developing the games for all of the PlayStation since PS2. <br />\nCrucial to notice: it is not a rhythm game but a singing game. Here the players need to sing karaoke-style, not match screen patterns with the background beats. Every version of the game differs from the previous one by the song list. It is rare that any technological improvement is included. For example, PS Move support or a special microphone release.<br />\nSingStar (2014) adds AR function for the PS4 gamers: it is now possible to see the lyrics or even avatars through the camera. Other than that it is just a competitive game featuring no plot whatsoever. The Party Mode includes up to eight singers simultaneously \u2014 the competitions like &#39;Pass the Mic,&#39; or &#39;Medley&#39; are available there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-22T10:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c3/8c312247dac2ef29cb69bc9995991e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.46, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 1201, "beaten": 29, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 108, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 352, "ratings_count": 214, "suggestions_count": 434, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 215, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
