No? Well, you will be lucky to have this experience right now. Every Thing Is Broken is a platformer game about not giving up even when everything seems broken, because there's always someone out there kind enough to give a helping hand. <br/><br/>This game was made for the Coding Blocks game jam with the topic, uhm.. \"everything is broken\". On the day it started I decided to join and give it a try, and eventually I came up with this idea. I'm not a programmer and had just a few days to make this, so it's pretty short, but I might continue working on it in the future, who knows. <br/><br/>Anyways it's been a fun project! I hope you enjoy it ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb76451f4006e7bafa9d532a3358a714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cindamon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
