Use pixelated necromancy to smash cottages, scare townsfolk, and generally cause a ruckus in the campaign or survival mode. Items power up the player, have randomized availability, and change playstyle. Every enemy is lethal. Position the dead well to stay \"alive\".<br/><br/>See that grave site over there? It's free real estate.  Pick up that tattered spell book, grab yourself a curse, and spend a relaxing evening amongst your newfound skeleton buddies. <br/><br/><ul><li>Control large amounts of undead. Any enemy can be reused! <br/></li><li>Cast spells to support your skeleton crew or harm enemies directly. <br/></li><li>Collect and sell items to customize your loadout.         <br/></li><li>Find secrets to unlock new spells, abilities, and summons.  </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b13/b1365ff5b39fc4fd558966313ba61feb.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/skmP8Spnfb", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Night Job Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Night Job Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
