From the Big Leagues to Little League, coaches and parents count the number of pitches thrown during every game and each bullpen session.  Most leagues even have strict pitch counts that each pitcher must adhere to on a game-to-game basis.  While knowing how many pitches your pitcher threw is important, knowing where these pitches are being thrown is vital in measuring your pitchers progress.  This, along with many other features, is what separates this application from all other training tools developed for pitchers.<br/> <br/>pitcherStatsPro is a professional training aid developed to help coaches/trainers record a pitchers accuracy and consistency during a game or bullpen/training session. The data compiled will help coaches spot the tendencies of their entire pitching staff along with their strengths and weaknesses in locating up to four pitch types (fastball, change-up, slider, and curveball).  pitcherStatsPro also gives parents the ability to record stats in real time and compare the results with past performances as a way to objectively track the progress of one of the games biggest challenges-throwing strikes!<br/> <br/>Pitches are recorded within a 12-zone strike area giving the trainer/coach the details to determine the best training exercises. Knowing what pitching skill to concentrate on is a challenge but with pitcherStatsPro you can determine this in just a few sessions. Data can be viewed on the iPhone/iTouch real time or sent by email for later analysis. The goal of this tool is to help fine tune young or seasoned pitchers in the shortest possible time. <br/> <br/>Endorsements<br/><br/>Chris Fay, Baseball Instructor; \"This is the only application of its kind! pitcherStatsPro provides invaluable information on a pitcher.  Does the pitcher have command off his curveball? Does he or she tend to miss outside or inside? High or low? This is all information that can be used in developing and training your pitcher to excel on the mound. \"<br/><br/>Greg Sullivan, Head Coach Newbury College; \"pitcherStatsPro allows our entire pitching staff to see their strengths and more importantly their weaknesses in locating their fastball and off-speed pitches. In the past we have recorded all of this information by hand, however, pitcherStatsPro allows us the ability to accurately and quickly record every single pitch that our staff has thrown.  It is a great training tool for pitchers of all ages.\"<br/><br/>Features<br/>- Customize pitcher name/session information<br/>- Manage up to 30 pitchers<br/>- Track performance to last 5, 10 &amp; 20 sessions for each pitcher<br/>- Record pitches in 12 different zones<br/>- Record 4 pitch types (fastball, curveball, slider, change-up)<br/>- Instant performance feedback after each pitch<br/>- Start where you left off on exit/interruption<br/>- Save each session/screen snapshot to your photo album<br/>- Flexible to facilitate any situation; game/training<br/>- Email details &amp; summary data; includes automated screen snapshots as attachments<br/>- Import to excel via the email report<br/><br/>Statistics<br/>- Total pitches<br/>- Total strikes<br/>- % strikes<br/>- pitch count/% by zone/pitch type<br/>- summary by pitch type<br/>- track performance to previous 5, 10 &amp; 20 sessions<br/><br/>User Interface<br/>- manage pitchers (Pitchers)<br/>- input data (playBall)<br/>- accuracy &amp; consistency (Zone)<br/>- performance (Summary)<br/>- customize pitcher info<br/>- customize session comment<br/>- customize notes<br/>- track all pitches<br/>- audio &amp; visual feedback<br/>- screen capture of stats<br/>- recall last session upon program start<br/><br/>Background picture courtesy of Dave Nelson at www.flickr.com.
