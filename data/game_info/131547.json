This demo contains many effects common to C64 intros from those days.

The demo is the first 'trackmo' styled demo for the Vectrex and contains 5 parts of different graphics effects. (BTW this was my last Vec coding until returning to Vectrex programming in 2005).

As a concept for perhaps a future Vectrex game, the display shows a 64x64 map which the player can move freely across, along with a radar at the top of the screen showing the player's position as a white dot against a smaller rendition of the map</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf71701756efd883b47866eab8b879e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revival Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
