{"id": 913886, "slug": "groven", "name": "Groven", "name_original": "Groven", "description": "<p>The kingdom has evolved, and luxuries once known only in story books have now become a reality. You want it all! However, all great people have their humble beginnings. Yours just happens to be smithing. Your beloved mother has left you her forge and you will now embark on a journey to make as much Groven as you can to claim your luxury.<br/><br/>With the aid of your uncle, you will grow as a blacksmith and ruins adventurer. All good smiths know the value of their materials, and you will risk life and limb to obtain them in randomly generated caves, as well as searching for priceless artifacts that your uncle is devoted to research. These materials will be used to create requested items that are posted as jobs on the local village bulletin board, and the more you smith and complete jobs, the more you grow. Who knows, maybe eventually you will attract the eye of some important people... whether they be good or bad.<br/><br/>Main gameplay features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Procedural generated spelunking levels every time you enter, where you can gather materials and perhaps find other treasures as you explore<br/>\n</li><li>Smithing competition against 2 AI that allows you to level up your smithing rank upon victory<br/>\n</li><li>Randomly generated jobs with varying rewards and types such as \"high risk, high reward\" where if you fail to meet the job deadline, you get heavily penalized, but the reward is multiplied. Jobs also scale with smithing rank<br/>\n</li><li>Paper Mario inspired bauble system where you can find various baubles as you play and each bauble has a unique gameplay boost, whether it be in combat or in the platforming<br/>\n</li><li>Random events that can appear on the overworld map, or at your forge, which may lead to reward, though some may require risk<br/>\n</li><li>Treasure maps that can lead to riches, resources or price-less treasures<br/>\n</li><li>15 Crafting recipes for the forge, which can be found as you play<br/>\n</li><li>Real time combat that uses the dodge roll mechanic inspired by Enter the Gungeon and ability to combo strike or parry enemies with timed input presses\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Many more features are planned to be implemented, most of which are incentives to make more and more Groven, and I hope that you will stick by the project as these features are implemented.
