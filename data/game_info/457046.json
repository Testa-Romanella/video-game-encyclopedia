Big bugs, flying snakes and random meatballorites stand in your way... but with the power of the robolution, you will emerge victorious!<br/></p>\n<p>Robolution = Robot + revolution (clever)<br/>Revolution = an instant of revolving e.g. one revolution a second (very clever, we managed to fit the theme of the Godot Wild Jam #22)</p>\n<p>Control gravity while you spin with <strong>L7-ee (left turns)</strong> and <strong>R8-e (right turns)</strong>! (awesomely clever) Try to run through the different levels without harming our precious robots! (they aren't cheap to repair...)<br/>And be careful with the inertia you carry with your actions. With great power comes great robonsability...</p>\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please start with R8-e, since it will be easier on your bones (or bolts, as we robots like to say heheh).\u00a0L7-ee likes experienced hands better!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/931/9316bbdf10b4a7ac6bfcf6e51ecb2192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["team-kebab", "victorbenito", "carmenansio", "angelalb"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
