The player plays as the character Anxi who must jump around platforms and face their fears that look like them by blasting them with a beam that will turn them friendly. There are four levels with unique platform challenges and easy story levels in between. You are guided through the story by Anxi\u2019s friend Medi who helps them reframe their anxiety thoughts. Warning: platforming gameplay can be anxiety provoking, but it will be okay! Any feedback welcome! Thank you so much!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b63/b631a143e02ef334c7517f636e439aba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["megang"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
