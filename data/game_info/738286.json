Your virtual pets.<br/></strong>Buy new ones. Feed, clean, walk, train and rent.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Economic strategy<br/></strong>Buy, sell, earn!</p>\n<p><strong>3. Construction<br/></strong>Upgrade your ranch!</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Unfortunately, we have no time to fix the\u00a0HTML5 build, it was broken. Maybe after the JAM we will fix it.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>It was superhard to make strategy in 12-keys-only restrictions. So, we have several mappings to play.\u00a0But the screen always shows a button that must be pressed on the phone keypad.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Basic keys (on the phone):</strong></p>\n<p>* - enter/select<br/># - cancel/clear<br/>1 - help (press if you see a \u00a0icon on the screen to see help)<br/>2 - up<br/>4 - left<br/>5 - enter/select<br/>6 - right<br/>8 - down</p>\n<p><strong>NumPad\u00a0Mapping:</strong></p>\n<p>NumPad is mapped one-to-one (except swaped 2 and 8 because of another direction), and \"*\" mapped to Numpad \"*\" and Numpad \"Enter\" and \"#\" mapped to Numpad \"-\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard Mapping:</strong></p>\n<p>\"*\"\u00a0is mapped on \"Enter\" and \"Space\"<br/>\"#\" is mapped on \"Esc\"\u00a0and \"Backspace\"<br/><br/>There is text input in the game. The input is made similarly to the input on the 3310 - through multiple pressing of one key. To provide the ability to enter text for those who do not have a Numpad, we have mapped the buttons to 1-0 keys. And a \"1\"\u00a0key is mapped to \"F1\".</p>\n<p>Also, there is a F6 key, which toggles a \"real LCD effect\".</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>AUTHORS</strong></p>\n<p>Programming &amp; Sound: @aturbidflow<br/>Graphics:\u00a0@veksell<br/>Horse consultant:\u00a0Olya Ki</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T10:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/952a9601e2ffcf9479ec12ab083e9577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veksell", "Artem Flo", "aturbidflow", "kubik\u00e1mi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
