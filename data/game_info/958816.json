Inspired by the T-Rex Runner game in Google Chrome, you will guide your alpaca through a series of levels, but beware: many obstacles stand in the way of being able to let the wind soar through your wool!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeaturing simplistic gameplay, a beautiful NES-inspired soundtrack, and wonderful spritework, Alpaca Sprint is a nod to simpler times when the biggest achievement was beating your friends for the best score. Don't worry though: actual achievements still exist, too. Alpaca Sprint also includes local and online leaderboards (online leaderboards may only be available on mobile devices). If retro arcade style gaming is your thing, you'll feel right at home with Alpaca Sprint.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T05:34:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f9d39caf8251a8ef7f0245a7b6458f.jpg", "website": "https://brownhammerstudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PeaTeaSix", "Brown Hammer Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Brown Hammer Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
