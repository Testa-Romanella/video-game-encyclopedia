Let me know on twitter if you managed to beat it (and how many runs it took).<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>The key to completing it lies in mastering your skills</strong> (the buttons on the left side). This recharge at the start of each month.</p>\n<p><strong>Full instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>- You click on nearby tiles to move (you'll know you can move if the outline is yellow).</p>\n<p>- After you move to a new tile your stats will change.</p>\n<p>- There are skills you can use on the left. The first unblocks locked tiles (the ones you can't move to), click on that skill and then select a column. The second skills lets you jump over tiles, click on it and then select the tile where you want to go. The last one is a shield, click on it; it'll block the effect of the next tile you step on. YES, skills can be comined, for example, activate your shield and jump afterwards.<br/></p>\n<p>by Ludipe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a7ffe004dd81af4aa708e66585f7fd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
