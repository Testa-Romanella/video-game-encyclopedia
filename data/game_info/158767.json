Each level is composed of a single room that you can turn around as you please to get the character the goal.</p><p>The player is very fragile so even the smallest falls can kill it.  Thus, try to stay close to walls and sides when you turn the stage around and do not fall from ledges!</p><p>Control the rotation of the stage using the WASDQE keys and the player with the arrow keys.  If in need, press <strong>R </strong>to check control tip.</p><p>Thanks for playing and hope you fancy the game.
