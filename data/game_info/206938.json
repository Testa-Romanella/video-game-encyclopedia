C\u00e9zanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey C\u00e9zanne's intense study of his subjects. C\u00e9zanne is said to have formed the bridge between late 19th-century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. Both Matisse and Picasso are said to have remarked that C\u00e9zanne \"is the father of us all.\"</p><p>Included paintings:<br/>- The card players (Les joueurs de cartes)<br/>- Madame Cezanne in a red dress<br/>- Still life with a curtain<br/>- The bathers (Les grandes baigneuses)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07314a27f48fbe99c7ce92e62602a4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["sketchmyapp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
