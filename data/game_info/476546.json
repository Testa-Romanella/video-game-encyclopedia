Rely on your intuition and carefully study the details of the game. Over time, the tension will increase, creating an effect of insanity. The plot is not revealed linearly, almost without notes in the game world.<br/><br/><strong>This game is not suitable for those who are looking for a dynamic horror with action elements and a fast-paced plot.</strong><h3>Environment.</h3>The game takes place in a house where terrible events occurred earlier. You will have to repeatedly wander along the same corridor in order to uncover the causes of insanity and understand who you are. Be patient, and the house will open previously locked doors and show you frightening memories of the past. The narrative of the story is transmitted through the environment in a measured rhythm. Each item tells a story, relying on your imagination.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The demo version is a prequel to the main story and acts as an independent free game that tells the story of a family living long before the events that occur in the main game.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T23:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9017e4b1e2b008f5eafe6574647700.jpg", "website": "https://www.emikagames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EMIKA_GAMES", "Giuseppe Casteltrione"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["EMIKA_GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
