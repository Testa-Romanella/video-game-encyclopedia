Lose 1 point each time you shoot, gain 2 points for each plane or person destroyed. Take out a parachute and the person will fall and destroy any people already on the ground. If 10 people land, you are overrun and it is game over. It starts pretty slow but it gets pretty hectic!</p><p>Arrows to rotate gun, space to shoot. </p><p>Plane model from this pack.</p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #3 or 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96f98c6f1f4d0c492160bde706e2dde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
