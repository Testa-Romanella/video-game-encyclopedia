{"id": 804993, "slug": "countryballs-at-war", "name": "Countryballs at War", "name_original": "Countryballs at War", "description": "Countryballs at War is a Grand Strategy Game with turn mechanics and real-time combats involved. Your aim is to make your country a world superpower by building strong armies, controlling tax rates, increasing the happiness of your people, and upgrading your country.<br/><br/>In Countryballs at War, you can declare war, send ally requests, sign peace treaties, offer peace to enemies, and puppet weakened countries. You should choose your allies carefully because enemies will always try to capture your territories and destroy you. If you fail to rule your country, there will be rebellions in your country, and with rebellions, you will mostly lose half of your territories and armies.<br/><br/>You will start each game with attack and diplomacy points. Each time you attack a territory, it will consume one attack point. Likewise, each time you use diplomacy actions, it will consume one diplomacy point. After you end a turn, these points will reset. You can upgrade these points' limits in Academies!<br/><br/>In combats, your aim is to cross your enemies' borders by sending your units to the battlefield. Enemies will not accept that to happen that easily. So, you should call your allies to battle and you should build strong armies!<br/><br/>To build a strong army, you should unlock units from 'Barracks' and 'Artillery Depot' and upgrade them when you reach enough resources. There are tons of units that are 'unique' to each country and more will be coming soon with the next updates.<br/><br/>There are world events in Countryballs at War such as the 'Pirate Invasion'. Pirates will often invade territories with seaports, so you have to be careful!<br/><br/>Lastly, all countryballs are available to play, but some of them are locked. To unlock them you should find them! They are hidden in some areas. You can get some hints by clicking the 'Get Hint!' button in the game.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed playing Countryballs at War, please consider giving it 5 stars.
