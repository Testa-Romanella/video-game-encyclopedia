It's not a very good remake but I did what I set out to do with it. I actually finished it I improved the really bad engine I made. (not much I could do without starting over) It was a challenge to finish this in the state that it is in because this engine was so bad I had to redesign a lot of it. Besides all of that it has some fun mechanics that I used and refined in the sequel which I originally stopped developing this game for. (Which I'm in the middle of remaking)</p>\n<p>Goal: get to the light blue square and hit fire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:41:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/16771638d095add27505ace0979dcf1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mark 4 Productions"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
