Code, music, sfx, graphics and all.</p>\n<p>Fun features: flexible text box generator featuring text skip, collisions, special attack, juice.</p>\n<p>Controls: W, A, S, and D to move. Left mouse button to shoot. Right mouse button to special attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70dbef410bb5b88a63d1d532929552b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kyle's mit games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
