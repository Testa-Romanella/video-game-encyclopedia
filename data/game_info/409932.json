But I care too much about others, ignore my own feelings and bear any complaints silently. Life is not as good as we think, because someone is pretending us, we can only try to make up for the defects in life.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb5d533ba4d93c7cdd587205b84fc09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["qianxinan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
