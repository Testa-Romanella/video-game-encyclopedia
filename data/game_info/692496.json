You can interact with those words as well as the main title itself.</p>\n<p>- Pressing \"THE\" will turn the lights on and off, affecting what happens when you click on your words as well as certain other elements.</p>\n<p>- Pressing \"LAST\" will freeze or unfreeze the words.</p>\n<p>- Pressing \"OF\" will turn gravity on or off.</p>\n<p>- Pressing \"US\" will speed up or speed down the words.</p>\n<p>- You are also able to turn on/off the music and text-to-speech in the Settings.</p>\n<p>You are more than welcome to mess around with whatever you want. And remember, no bad words...</p>\r\n[Descriptions]\r\n<p>This interactive poster was built off of the game poster design. It has many of the same colors with the addition of a few more to give it more vibrance. The game poster's original intended theme was about words/trivia and this interactive poster was to visually build off of that aesthetic. I wanted to make it to where the viewer can type words and interact with them, as well as with the main title itself.\u00a0</p>\r\n[Known Bugs/Issues]\r\n<p>\u00a0- Due to the limitations of P5.js, the text-to-speech is very slow and reads one at a time. It can stack up a lot when given too many things to read out.</p>\n<p>- Some words won't register when they're clicked.</p>\n<p>- The music may not play at start sometimes.</p>\n<p>- Words can get stuck at the edges of the screen when speeding up/down.<br/></p>\r\n[Credits]\r\n<p>Bounce Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/freesoundMozardes/sounds/514640/</p>\n<p>Ding Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/MashedTatoes2/sounds/515643/</p>\n<p>Bonk Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/LittleLuigi/sounds/364790/</p>\n<p>Light Switch Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/joedeshon/sounds/119415/</p>\n<p>Gravity Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/pfranzen/sounds/393745/</p>\n<p>Power Up Sound -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/rkkaleikau/sounds/588251/</p>\n<p>Freeze Sound - My Ugly Voice that was edited in Audacity</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0BOB BEAT 6 by BrothaD [https://prosearch.tribeofnoise.com/artists/show/44327/33524]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T11:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69c/69c8e9eb5b2b5b9efb92add3b90cdbcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joshdotwav"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
