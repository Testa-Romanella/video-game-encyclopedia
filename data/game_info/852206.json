I\u2019ve been a fan of turn based RPGs my whole life so this means I know their strong points, tropes and flaws very well. As such I wanted to make something that leans in to some of these aspects, yet also is fresh in its perspective.</p>\n<p>This classic style, turn based RPG has your party exploring the world, visiting exciting towns and dungeons, all in the name of finding \"the Thing\". I'm also happy to say that one town in the game is an Irish speaking Gaeltacht, enhancing that sense of travel as you explore.</p>\n<ul><li>2-3 Hours play time</li><li>50 Monster types</li><li>Optional party member</li><li>Meaningful choices</li><li>4 Ultimate weapons</li><li>Irish speaking town</li><li>A world of towns and villages to explore</li></ul>\n<p>The game was made using RPG Maker and its assets.</p>\n<p>Additional music provided by\u00a0audionautix.com</p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy my game and thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>You can check out the Final Thing Quest trailer here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T18:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ff/7ffa2f65d7dc81e808b9dc4d530475ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valhallions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
