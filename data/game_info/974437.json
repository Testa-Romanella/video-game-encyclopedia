Each play-through features procedurally generated towers for the player to place with different shot patterns, range, damage, and abilities! Players choose which towers to research and upgrade during each play-through, decisions which could mean the difference between passing your class, or turning in a smoldering husk for your final project! Place your towers strategically on your circuit board, because procedurally generated waves of bugs have come to destroy your hard work!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll towers and enemies are rendered in hand-crafted, isometric, vaporwave pixel-art style! The towers and enemies also emit detailed video effects from particles being blown off of them to arcs of chain lightning! Blast and relax to Electron Flux\u2019s midi-inspired original score and handcrafted sound effects!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T06:30:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b20d1cf51e9725931a4c0b3998a543c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flightless Squid Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flightless Squid Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
