Rupert hates water, but to keep from starving and most importantly to keep Riley from looking at him as dinner he is gearing himself up for the task. The object of the game is to capture the fish that come as orders from Riley on the boat with your bubble gun and turn them in without losing all your Air. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRiley\u2019s Fish orders are located at the top of the screen in a particular order and you must capture the fish using a gun that produces bubbles in order to beat the level. However, along with fish that needs to be captured there are also other challenges on each level. Rupert must keep up with Riley as he moves forward, but watch out for enemy fish and obstacles! Luckily, Rupert has rigged his bubble gun to fire pearls at them as he collects Riley\u2019s ever growing list of fish he wants and Riley has to do something with all those fish bones. To make Rupert\u2019s fishing task a bit easier he obtains more powerful bubble weapons as each Island increases in difficulty. There's also power-ups located in the luggage that can be purchased with in-game coin to help Rupert out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis isn\u2019t your typical laid back fishing trip, no sir. However, Rupert and Riley are so caught up in catching fish that they don\u2019t realize they might be an even bigger catch. Just be wary of greater enemies that lurk in dark places, stay savvy and good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures-<br/>\r\nAddictive, adorable and comical game-play- 20 levels of Bubble Fun!<br/>\r\n5 Islands, each with a different weapon, environment, and obstacles!<br/>\r\nMini-games and bosses for each Island<br/>\r\nUnlockable achievements", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/395/3953d3ed267514464efd1871f98f6c70.jpg", "website": "https://www.madfrogstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadFrog Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["MadFrog Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
