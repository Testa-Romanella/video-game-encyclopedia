The game has been built for room scale VR, but can be played in a small place.<br/></p>\n<p>Gravity was\u00a0developed for research\u00a0- investigating ways to reduce virtual reality sickness,\u00a0<em>without</em>\u00a0sacrificing immersion. The research project has reached the end of it's life (for now), and now I am making the game available for anyone to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gravity was designed to induce a very particular feeling\u00a0of sickness,\u00a0and does break some VR \"rules\" to do so. You shouldn't get too sick with this demo, but remember to take a break if you do.</p>\n<p>Gravity features mechanics from similar games, such as:</p>\n<ul><li>Pressing buttons</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Picking up, moving, and placing boxes on things</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Falling</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>It also features some mechanics that similar games don't have:</p>\n<ul><li>Changing gravity</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Holding two boxes at once</li></ul>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Both hands act the same. You can play with one controller if you wanted to!</li><li><strong>Joystick / Touchpad</strong> moves with smooth locomotion. There is no teleport or turning options, sorry.</li><li><strong>Trigger </strong>to change gravity or throw a held box.</li><li><strong>Grip </strong>to pick up boxes.</li></ul>\n<p>Discuss on the Geko Games discord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/828c5c0b35e6d77d8623a1d3e0c739bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geko Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
