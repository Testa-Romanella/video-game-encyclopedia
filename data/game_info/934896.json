With the help of memorable foods, neurons will deviate from their normal growing path and follow an old direction which allows them to reconnect once again. Neurons pass down electricity just like plant roots pass nutrients to a plant. Our story also has an underlying \"root-related\" metaphor that we would like the player to try to interpret.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T09:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ce/7cebbbf69c469cd1e5bd0d34559d0594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["PACA", "ElfPenguin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
