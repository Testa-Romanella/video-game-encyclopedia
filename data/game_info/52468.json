The game was also licensed to Cinematronics for conversion to cocktail arcade cabinets in North America.</p>\n<p>The game is one of the first shooters with scrolling in multiple directions. It is also the first color game released by SNK and an early example of a dual-control game, similar to the later Robotron: 2084, but using four directional buttons rather than a second joystick.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c3/4c3694d49b7701bd8a0a7b55a538c533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 5200", "PlayStation 3", "Atari 2600", "PSP"], "developers": ["Tose", "Tose Co."], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari", "SNK", "Centuri", "Zaccaria"], "esrb_rating": null}
