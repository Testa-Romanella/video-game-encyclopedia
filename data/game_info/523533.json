Once you have your two options written down, collect your gear and go back to the\u00a0<strong>Utility Area</strong>, which acts as a shop and safe haven, and leave the house with the big red button to see if you are right.</p>\n<p>If you are connected to the internet, the game will look for updates, and if there is one available you have the option to visit this web page (though in DEV-002B, the game instead links to my blog page).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/824632eea4946dbdd667cc880e92acfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsMiatch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
