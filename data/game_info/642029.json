Endangered whales like Whaley's species of the North Atlantic Right Whale are faced with the effects of human pollution in the sea, and many often do not make it to adulthood and reach their breeding ground off the coasts of Florida, USA. They encounter many \"foreign\" objects in their life, most of it due to humans, like fishing nets, ships, trash, and also fish that may be naturally poisonous or poisoned from polluted waters. The whales' natural environment thus becomes \"foreign\" to the whale itself! We hope that our game can be fun and educational at the same time by highlighting the dangers faced by whales. Many thanks to Level Up Circle for organising this jam.</p>\n<p>Developers:\u00a0yoVeronn, ruixin__</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e05/e05c8b4712caecc34e137600485b2b90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["yoVeronn", "ruixin__"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
