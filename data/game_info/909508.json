Something went wrong and now some of the subjects have escaped and started terorizing the guards. You play as a scientist who saw how inhumane people were being treated and wanted to help them, but you got caught and were about to be used as one of the test subjects for a new drug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is firstperson and is played using a mouse only.
