{"id": 907442, "slug": "gross", "name": "GROSS", "name_original": "GROSS", "description": "Get ready for a thrilling and innovative gaming experience with GROSS, a hybrid of tower defense and first person shooter genres. With its fresh and unique mechanics, you'll be hooked from the start as you strategize and defend your way to victory.<br/><br/>Join our Discord<br/><br/><br/><br/>In GROSS, you are tasked with defending your base against waves of enemy attackers in classic tower defense fashion. You have the freedom to build barricades and turrets to create mazes and launch attacks on the enemy, as well as place traps on the ground for added defense.<br/><br/>During the construction phase, you can experiment with different combinations of turrets and barriers to come up with the most effective obstacle course for your attackers. And don't worry about time limits or wasted resources - you can sell everything you build for a full refund until the next combat phase begins. So if you love the strategy and satisfaction of building the ultimate tower defense setup, GROSS is the game for you!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once you are done building your defenses, get ready for intense, fast-paced combat! With a huge arsenal of guns at your fingertips, each featuring different ammo types, you'll have to make split-second decisions to take down waves of zombies. Full metal jacket rounds can pierce through multiple enemies and even objects, while hollow points send foes flying and give you some breathing room. Incendiary rounds ignite zombies and keep them burning, and grenade and rocket launchers can deal massive damage to groups of enemies - but watch out, they may also destroy valuable cash pickups.<br/><br/>In addition to all these guns, you'll also have access to a range of active abilities that give you even more ways to defeat or distract enemies, move around more efficiently, or manage your resources. With over a dozen weapons to choose from, gunplay in our game is always exciting and rewarding. Are you ready to take on the undead?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Money is essential for success. You'll need to gather it from defeated enemies as quickly as possible, but beware - you're not the only one after this valuable resource. You'll need to get it to safety so you can buy defensive structures and active abilities, and it also plays a major role in determining your score.<br/><br/>GROSS keeps you on your toes at all times. Every action you take - or don't take - has consequences. If you focus on taking out attackers while your defenses are overwhelmed, you might turn the tide of battle, but you'll also risk losing precious money that could be used to improve your defenses in the next construction phase. Stay sharp and stay ahead of the game to come out on top!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T04:35:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a402b4d2f69307e2fe1a463e4338748c.jpg", "website": "https://hangryowl.games/gross", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 532, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hangry owl games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Hawthorn Games", "hangry owl games"], "esrb_rating": null}
