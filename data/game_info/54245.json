The quality of the full motion video on the Sega CD version is less than that of the others. Also, after the release of the Sega CD version, Digital Pictures created an option to have English subtitles during the full motion video as critics had complained that it was difficult to understand what the driver was saying in the Sega CD and Sega 32X versions. Corpse Killer was the first CD game released for the Sega 32X.</p>\n<p>Footage from the game was later recycled for the 2003 film Game Over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f1290d54a99f637def413baa6642fa0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "SEGA 32X", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA Saturn", "3DO"], "developers": ["Digital Pictures"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Digital Pictures"], "esrb_rating": null}
