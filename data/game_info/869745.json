The owners of your property are not in the mood to hand out candy, so they leave out a bowl with a sign to take one. However, you know as the resident guardian ghost, that many kids aren't that obedient. Armed with your trusty\u00a0garden hose, assure that many kids leave happy and candy-full, no matter the cost!</p>\n<p>Press space or click to spray hose! But be careful, if you spray the hose when the kids are good they get compensatory candy in return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Gian-Paolo: Production, Art, Sound</p>\n<p>Skylar: Coding</p>\n<p>Jane: Coding</p>\n<p>Leo: Design</p>\n<p>Avery: Art</p>\n<p>Helena: Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T05:27:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d58/d58dbd202c20bc12762e707ff30dc91e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ginvr", "CyborgButOk", "glibbert", "Nightmerp"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
