The same flowers would follow the standard match-3 rule\u00a0 even with more than 3 flowers are matched in a row. T-shape and L-shape matches are also available and when more than 5 flowers matched at the same time a bigger flower survives.<br/><br/>This is a hard game that requires you to discover some specific patterns of movement that could help you through the whole game. The modular 3 property is introduced naturally by match-3 rule that would prompt you to carefully calculate the state of player on board.</p>\n<p>This is my first game on this platform and I tried to make the game self-contained. If the rule is still not clear please comment below and let me improve my games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/574/5743c6ac4205e70c60baaaf9667d7f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hungwei"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
