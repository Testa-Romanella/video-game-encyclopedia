Yes the old board game finally comes to the pc. It has all the cool stuff, pawns, rooks, bishops, knights, a king and even a real queen. All your wet board chess dreams will become true.</p>\n<p>In addition it has top notch graphics, state of the art for 1990 SNES games. All pixly and stuff. Animations sounds and the best part: It is chess.</p>\n<p>You can play with your friends locally on one PC , like with a chess board but cooler. Or if you are like me and don't have local friends or your friends are morons who can't play chess it has even an online mode to play with friends all over the world. And if you are a lonely annoying dude who has no friends at all it has even an Artificial Intelligence included which will for sure kick your ass, so you can try to beat it and play with yourself all day, like you already do.</p>\n<p>You are not cool enough to just play good ol' chess? It is boring you say? It is to hard you say? You may be right. For that reason I have included chess riddles to train your skills without getting the humiliation of getting your ass kicked by a stupid bot or random dudes on the internet. If you want it to be more entertaining and start from the beginning, the game will include a campaign which teaches you how to play chess with a story deeper than all Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan movies combined. You will laugh, you will cry and you will rage.</p>\n<p>Did I mention, it is chess, the oldest and most balanced game created?<br/></p>\n<p>This game is still in alpha, so if you encounter some bugs: Feel free to tell me about it, here or on one of the several other social media platforms I am on.</p>\n<p>If you have things you don't like or ideas to improve the game: Shut the fuck up...just kidding, feel also free to tell me about it. I'm always open for ways which could enrich the game.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to follow the progress and support me:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Things already included:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Local Multiplayer</li><li>The Kingdom Faction</li><li>Different colors for the factions to choose from</li></ul>\n<p><strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Things nearly included:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>AI for Singleplayer</li><li>Online Multiplayer with lobby\r\n</li><li>First Biom</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Planned but not finished:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sounds</li><li>Tutorial</li><li>Campaign</li><li>Chess puzzles</li><li>Quick game with ranking for online multiplayer</li><li>4 other factions</li><li>4 different bioms<ul><li>6 maps per biom</li></ul></li><li>Chat function</li><li>Banner for online games</li><li>Lore for characters, factions and bioms</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T15:17:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/354/35432996db040360f776f891772d6fee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KeyboardKrieger"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
