{"id": 635883, "slug": "endgame-road-to-salvation-itch", "name": "Endgame: Road To Salvation (itch)", "name_original": "Endgame: Road To Salvation (itch)", "description": "<p>The world is under siege from an unknown enemy. Gates are appearing, spawning demonic entities. Major cities have been destroyed with overwhelming force. Most of the population has been decimated, but the dead rise again to feast on the living. There was no warning, no signs, but there is no doubt... This is the apocalypse. There are rumours of massive fortified strongholds around the world, properly defended against these dark invaders. The closest stronghold is called Salvation, but getting there will prove to be a long, challenging road. If there is any hope of survival, it rests far to the North at the gates of Salvation.<br/></p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>I am proud to present the first release from Indie/Anon Games, Endgame: Road to Salvation. It is a road trip combat style of game with rpg/survival/roguelike elements such as 6 main attributes and 26 skills to develop, over 300 craftable items, and full ragdoll physics. It is a unique hybrid of top-down/twin stick shooter and third person camera control while driving. As the player, you have to drive North and reach the safety of the distant stronghold Salvation, delivering your caravan with as many survivors as possible from the cruelty of the Apocalypse. You can accomplish this monumental task by staying armed, fed, and mobile, and keep your caravan happy and safe. The enemy are more active at night, meaning you should find shelter and stay hidden, and hope that nothing tears down the walls around you. This is a really difficult game and you may be forced to make tough decisions on the fly, but the random generation and AI storyteller will keep you moving.\u00a0\u00a0Rescue survivors, form a caravan, call in various support drops or air strikes, loot random structures for supplies or craft them yourself, modify common vehicles into post-apocalyptic machines of war.<br/></p>\r\nDrop In/Out Local Co-Op\r\n<p>The game contains local co-op split screen, which can be played with either a keyboard/mouse or gamepad controller for player 1, and a gamepad controller for player 2. The single player game can be played with either the keyboard/mouse or a gamepad controller. Player 2 can drop in or out of the game at any time, maintaining their character through a slot-based save system. Co-operative play allows certain privileges such as reviving a fallen player, controlling a trailer turret, firing from the passenger seat, or just having a friend watch your back.<br/></p>\r\nPowerful Support Options\r\n<p>Gather as much loot as you can and send it back to the convoy from activated radio towers or inside the colony. Loot is broken down into basic caravan materials; Wood, Metal, Electronics, Fabrics, Food, Medicine, and Firepower. These basic materials are used to unlock material/survivor capacity bonuses and higher department levels, which in turn unlocks stronger support options. All weapons, traps and turrets add to the Firepower stockpile, so be sure to disassemble them first if you prefer the base materials. These support options can be the difference between life and death.<br/></p>\r\nStay mobile, Stay alive\r\n<p>No matter how well equipped or skilled you become, you cannot take on every enemy on foot. A light vehicle support option will always be available to you for quick getaways, if you can survive long enough for the delivery. You will be forced to flee from the enemy masses until you have a vehicle modified for combat. Using a combination of support drops, mounted vehicle weaponry, and guile, you can take on anything.</p>\r\nGameplay Video\r\n\r\nSome features include:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Day/Night System</strong>\u00a0- Enemies are more restless at night, try to find a safe place to sleep before the sun goes down, or be prepared for a long night.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Temperature System</strong>\u00a0- Lightning storms, tornadoes and other weather effects can change the environment around you, making the landscape wet, tearing apart buildings, ect.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>RPG Character Creation with Extensive Skill/Attribute System</strong>\u00a0- Pick a random character or customize your own with multiple classes and 26 skills.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Vehicle Modification System</strong>\u00a0- Multiple vehicle mods can be found, transferred from other vehicles, or crafted.
