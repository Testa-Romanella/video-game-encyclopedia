Its only compatible with 64 bit versions of windows and I don't know how to fix that. The Escape the house series will get more complex as I learn more C++ coding. Honestly I'm using the itchio account as a portfolio of me learning C++.<br/><br/>Please do not underestimate how simple this game is. Having the manual open while playing will be useful.<br/></p><p>This game functions more like a test of the basic mechanics, and any story elements are hidden. The sequels will build on this in both story and mechanics.</p><p>I don't know if it will work on non-windows systems. I doubt it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
