It\u2019s the night before the trial, and all evidence points to his guilt. When all hope seems lost, you receive word from your former partner, Eric White, that his organization has a way to help. <br/><br/>D.I.V.E., a top secret machine developed for use by the WATCHDOG Corps that can be used to view a person\u2019s memories directly. All he needs is someone to help him test it, someone with combat experience and a strong sense of personal justice. In exchange for helping him refine the machine and gather evidence on cold cases, he\u2019ll allow you to use it to clear your son\u2019s name by examining the memories directly. <br/><br/>With time of the essence and the warped environments of criminal minds as your battlefield, will you be capable of discovering the truth? And even more important, do you really even want to?</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>ESC - Menu</p>\n<p>E - Analyze/Interact</p>\n<p>Right Click - Open Revolver Menu</p>\n<p>Left Click - Confirm Selection / Use Last Revolver Action</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel - Select Revolver Action</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Sound: Greg Wilson<br/></p>\n<p>Design: Merlin Ahrenadel</p>\n<p>Character Artist:\u00a0Nicolo Allado</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0Mark Rittman</p>\n<p>Lead/Environment Artist: Andre Tran</p>\n<p>Concept Artist:\u00a0Kai Hoffman</p>\n<p>Narrative: Zachary Mangen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:40:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/400/4006bdc2c1b62bdcdd9ccde71d166b07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Merlin Ahrenadel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
