Just killing enemies won't get you anywhere though. Collect light tokens and bring them back to the light (don't forget to hold E) to level up, increasing your speed, damage and cooldowns. The light is fragile though, so if enemies get near it, they'll destroy it quickly! Each time you level up the light, you get access to a perk.
