Art has always been my weakness when making games, so I wanted to challenge myself to create a game that forces me to make a lot of art. So the idea of a medtroidvania came to mind. This was also my first time ever animating.</p>\n\r\nCredit:\r\n<p>Thanks to my brother Andrew for the nice ambient sounds.\u00a0https://gummerfly.bandcamp.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>All develoment, art, and sound fx made by Medow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T19:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012484658e30ee420f23f83f126b6ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Medow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
