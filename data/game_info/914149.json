This is a PC version of this ancient game.</p>\n<p>The game has 3 AI difficulties. Kevin who is just learning the rules, Leonard who is practised but can be over zealous and Irving who is more tactical. He is named after Irvin Finkell\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Finkel\u00a0who discovered the rules to this\u00a0 milennia old game so we can play it today.<br/><br/><strong>- RULES -\u00a0</strong><br/>Both players roll 4 x 2 sided die (a tetrahedron but it's 1:2 chance to get a 1 or a 0. You move your stone to the value of the die. Landing on an opponents stone gets it kicked off the board. You cannot land on your own stone and you cannot land on an enemy stone that is on a rosette-square. There are several versions of the path on the board in this game you can select either the classical path or an alternate interpretation.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0- ME -\u00a0</strong><br/>I am hobbyist game developer and this project was inspired by\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/quill18creates/\u00a0where he made a prototype of The Royal Game of Ur in a stream. Having been fascinated with this historical game for years I decided to make my own.<br/><br/>I might update this project at some time. But currently I consider this finished. Any feedback, comments suggestion and bug reports are greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T11:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76bf783569610a5ac271ac7be51c2bdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solitar"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
