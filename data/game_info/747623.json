{"id": 747623, "slug": "nolwenn", "name": "Nolwenn", "name_original": "Nolwenn", "description": "<p>Cree for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 on the theme of \"It's not real\". I chose to use this theme to illustrate a complicated point of mental illness: the denial of its entourage that does not always consider these diseases as real. In addition to this, the controls, although simple (arrowkeys), will go against what you may have learn until now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay :</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>A simple story with short dialogues to guide you through your adventure, and a simple goal: get Nolwenn to the end of each level.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Beat the levels, puzzle after puzzle, reaching the end plate. Destroy the obstacles that appear as you go along. Or learn to live with them and use them to go further.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Take on the challenge of the controls that will make you think despite their simplicity.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Live the infinite adventure in a world that is getting bigger and bigger.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Story :</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A metaphor for the doubts and problems caused by sickness, obstacles will block or slow down Nolwenn on her journey. Those made of stones appear at the loading of a level and you can't interact with them like insoluble problems. Wooden or ceramic obstacles appear as you go along, they can be destroyed if you hit them and represent more temporary but sometimes annoying problems.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls :</strong>\n</p>\n<p>[arrow] to slide in this direction (careful : as the level increases, the directions will change from one level to another) or hit wooden or ceramic obstacles in this direction<br/>[R] to restart a level (randomly generated at each start)<br/>[Space] to pass dialogue</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Credit\u00a0:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game Creation &amp; game design -<br/> Kyofa\r\n  </p>\n<p>Graphics - <br/>World by Cainos Chen -\u00a0https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic<br/>Character by aztrakatze -\u00a0https://aztrakatze.itch.io/top-down-character-pack-4-directions?download</p>\n<p>Music -<br/>TheSearch by Jaunter -\u00a0https://www.auboutdufil.com/index.php?id=574</p>\n<p>Fonts - <br/>Rainy Hearts by Camellina -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/rainyhearts.font<br/>Alagard by Hewett Tsoi -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/hewett-tsoi.d4888</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b1a096aa8ff0d7ab80c5dd0b2a81b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kyofa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
