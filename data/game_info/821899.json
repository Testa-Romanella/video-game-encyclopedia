Each turn you will roll the dice and get a number from the card. Then you can shuffle that exact number of cards randomly. If the dice is \"1\", all the cards will be shuffled randomly. The game mechanics seem impossible to win, but I promise you there is a small trick that you can always win the game ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:06:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b661e83316c6c8ff602e1d011ad873f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kither12"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
