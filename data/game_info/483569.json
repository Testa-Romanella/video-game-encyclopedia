During these times where gathering together in person is so difficult, the job of a postman becomes more and more essential in ensuring that everyone can stay connected to the people and services important to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, \"Mail Run\", you are the postman for the local neighborhood. Control the postie using arrow keys, and deliver mail (use left ALT key) to the moving houses. A house that receives mail will stop moving. The more mail you deliver, the higher your score is, so deliver as much as you can in 30 seconds!</p>\n<p>But beware: teddy bear pedestrians roam the streets, and have no concept of social distancing.\u00a0 Avoid them at all costs if you don't want to get sick! Throw pancakes (use space bar) at the teddy bears to make them go away.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Postman, teddy bear, mail and pancake sprites/animations + music are ORIGINAL (made by our team).</em></strong></p>\n<p>Github link -\u00a0https://github.com/prashanthshri95/UNIJAM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:40:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/998bedf19d4ef396b164c904973486ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["pancakeattack"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
