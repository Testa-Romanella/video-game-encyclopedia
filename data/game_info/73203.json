In this race you do not need to become a hot dog or a grilled sausage. To prevent this from happening, you overcome the obstacle in the form of knives and grill pans. Someone will just say run a sausage, but that's not enough, you need to fly so that you are not served as a hot dog. On the run you can collect coins and then for coins you can become, for example, a running bacon. Okay enough to talk about the game it's time to tell the sausage run and send it to the kitchen!<br/><br/>A running sausage is not very cool, but we need to write about the features of the game:<br/>1. The peculiarity is that the sausage is running!<br/>2. And there are knives and fire there, just like a game of fire!<br/>3. If you scream at a smartphone sausage run, then ... there will be a super mega nothing!)))", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f082ef5607f2e8bd2eadd62e6b02414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MARINA VALEKHOVA"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["MARINA VALEKHOVA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
