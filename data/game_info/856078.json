Between school and other things I didn't get much time to work on it, and because of how inexperienced I am most of my working time was spent watching tutorials anyway.\u00a0 My goal was to make something (at least mostly) functional within the Jam time frame, and I was able to do that, so I'm satisfied. When I get better at this I'll start striving to make games that are actually fun, lol. I'm able to recognize most of the flaws the game has, as there's a lot more I'd do with it if I had the time, but any constructive criticism is still really valuable to me! So thanks for playing and giving feedback if you do.\u00a0 :)<br/><br/>(Sorry about not having a web build, I couldn't get it to work T-T)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T18:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87e/87ea934d019cc6769fea565b3a60a225.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArgentumStaar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
