Still, you advance through the house, despite your fear, knowing that you are on the right path, as indicated by the presence of the Motogotchi (handheld game consoles) of the children who disappeared there before.</p>\n\n\n<p>Developed by:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Alcaval\u00a0- Programming &amp;\u00a03D\u00a0Modelling\r\n    </p>\n<p>Dededec\u00a0 - Programming &amp;\u00a03D\u00a0Modelling</p>\n<p>JaviBermanBD - Sound Design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T12:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b398697d2a3aab0af3b2b7baed67a409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dededec", "Alcaval"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
