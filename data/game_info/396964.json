Let them feel the wrath... of grease!</p>\n<p>Move with WASD, use your grease gun with LMB, and dash with RMB. Grease the stage, then dash into enemies to shove them into spikes.<br/></p>\n<p>Originally submitted to Ludum Dare 32.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:09:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/8767fc94528ac31e1fe4c1487ca0fde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Boxed Meat Revolution"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
