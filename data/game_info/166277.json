Providing the possible client with a fully featured 360\u00b0 view around the car, he can easily check for any scratches there might be and be sure about the car itself before he might take a long way to testdrive the real car at a distant location.\r\n</p><p>Soon our used cars on www.dasweltauto.at will feature this 360\u00b0 inside and outside option.</p><p>\n<br/>\r\nIf you are interested in updates, or in how far we will use this technology in a real life application in austria, feel free to contact me.</p><p>This game has been produced by DasWeltauto of the Porsche Austria GmbH &amp; Co OG, Louise-Pi\u00ebch-Stra\u00dfe 2, A-5020 Salzburg</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b72276024674f25fcc0a91c1d6460e39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Porsche Holding"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
