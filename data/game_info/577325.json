You take on the mission to\u00a0rescue all monsimals.\u00a0Observe them, catch them with\u00a0tools and traps, make friends ... and gain skills together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Can you rescue them all?</p>\n\r\nThe features\r\n<ul><li>Watch fantastic\u00a0animals in a lively 2D pixel-art world, each with individual traits and behaviours.</li><li>Catch them with tools, traps or with the help of your new friends.</li><li>Level-up your skills and tools to catch even more.</li><li>Release the monsimals in a new home.</li></ul>\n\r\nThe controls\r\n<p>Use Controller or Keyboard or Keyboard &amp; Mouse. Fangsi is playtested with my 4 year old daughter to make sure the Controller is easy and intuitive to handle.</p>\n\r\nWhat to expect from the game and its future?\r\n<ul><li>Fangsi is meant to be casually enjoyed.</li><li>Fangsi starts fast and lets the player explore on their own pace.\u00a0No story-driven progress or long cinematic cut-scenes.\u00a0</li><li>Fangsi is currently a single player game. Multiplayer is not expected, although I might consider a couch-coop in the future.</li><li>What you can download now is a demo and proof-of-concept. I'm planning on working with the concept by adding more ... more monsimals with more behaviours, more biomes with self drawn pixel-art, more tools. Also the ship should become your home over time and will get some love eventually.</li></ul>\n\r\nA personal note\r\n<ul><li>I started my own indie-game-dev adventure because I have seen my kids\u00a0\u00a0(4 and 10) being fascinated by the monster-taming genre. However old-school as well as modern games of the genre are not working for them. Why? There are\u00a0two main designs prominent in all games:\u00a0(slow) story-driven progress and/or controls with purely text-based menus.\u00a0My vision for Fangsi is to create a\u00a0world that sparks imagination while catching and collecting\u00a0monsters.</li><li>I'm developing Fangsi in my free time - further\u00a0progress might be slow and content might change.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>I hope you (or your kids) enjoy Fangsi. Let me know if it works and feel free to send me wishes and ideas via the comments.</p>\n<p>See you, Kathleen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e9f6e504c1ca2a9c4b34d00a1ecb82b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kathleenkirchner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
