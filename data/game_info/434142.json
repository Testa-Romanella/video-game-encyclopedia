Every action (moving, attacking, being attacked) consumes nutrition. When your nutrition is 0, the action(s) will consume the player's hitpoints instead. By consuming food, you can maintain the player's nutrition.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-------------------</p>\n<p>We took the theme as a literal \"keep me alive\" for the player<br/>This is kind of a cop out of the theme but it works and we added a nutrition mechanic to keep track of as well to reinforce the theme.</p>\n<p>Halfway through this weekend I had thought to myself \"oh my god we are in over our heads\", but we actually were able to get a fully functional game done.</p>\n<p>We were a team of 3 programmers<br/>-Scott\u00a0<br/>-Zach<br/>-Joey dubalingarino</p>\n<p>and 2.5 artists<br/>-Ryan<br/>-James</p>\n<p>- 0.5 scotts (art director)</p>\n<p>This is our first game jam, the second game together as a team and by far the most in depth game any of us had made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea724bbd8fb6fb259da1f6d453391c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dreamsteppe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
