This is the first game I've ever made, so please keep expectations low. My main goal for this jam was to create a 3D playable third person game, and to experiment with different textures. I used wall textures from here:\u00a0https://ethantaylor.itch.io/cyberpunk-materials</p>\n<p>I also used HDRP.\u00a0 I don't think older PC's without any Direct11/12 support will be able to run this game. Why I\u00a0decided to try using HDRP on the first game I've ever made is a question I can't answer.</p>\n<p>I don't really consider this game finished, but I will not be updating it.</p>\n<p>Controls are WASD or arrow keys to move,\u00a0and mouse for camera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84d/84d88d23f3cf4c416c2b727e21d462e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miracls"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
