The assignment was to create a top-down \"tag\" game with some sort of scoring system in Unity. I decided that zombies would be a good theme for it. Short and sweet but definitely a lot of replay value to survive as long as possible. More zombies spawn as the game goes on. Uncertain if this will receive updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c70/c70775b6a82bbc61f01c21f42ff252e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThunderclawStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
