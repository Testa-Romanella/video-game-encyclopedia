{"id": 61468, "slug": "trials-of-ascension-exile", "name": "Trials of Ascension: Exile", "name_original": "Trials of Ascension: Exile", "description": "Trials of Ascension: Exile is a hardcore sandbox fantasy game where you will play as a human mastering your skills, evolve for the hunt as a Raknar, or defy all odds to grow as a powerful dragon!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Survival is the goal of every life that finds its way to the Lost Isles. With hunger and thirst a constant threat, food and water will be top priorities. But dangers lurk around every corner and many environmental factors need careful consideration. Shelter and other means of protection will be necessary to fend off all threats, including aggressive predators.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to Health and Stamina, the Balance attribute brings a new aspect to combat. Maintain your balance and you are rewarded with solid footing; attack recklessly and you chance exposing yourself instead. Unbalanced characters find their swings are less effective and they run the risk that a well placed blow will knock them down. Additionally, each race has their own unique way of treating wounds.<br/><br/><br/>Time is in constant motion on the islands, with day cycles that bring truly dark nights and changing weather patterns that forecast rain, wind, and storms, all of which will affect your character. Every piece of flora, fauna and minerals are interact-able and offer an abundance of resources to assist in your survival.<br/><br/><br/>Each island can be set with a wide range of options so that you can play just the way you like. From flora and fauna spawn rates, to PvP settings, even to the number of lives each character is allowed, ToA: Exile can be set to your liking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>For untold centuries the Lost Isles have been the hatching and nursery grounds for your kind. Only those strong enough to survive on these hostile lands earn the right to reach adulthood and advance dragon-kind. Freshly hatched from the shell, you find yourself surrounded by new enemies your ancestors never faced in their tender years. Can you use your wits to overcome these new threats, or will the death of your kind begin with you?<br/><br/><br/>Dragons are the most challenging race to play in ToA: Exile, as they lack the natural arsenal of the raknar and the ingenuity of the humans. Skilled and resourceful players will be able to overcome this disadvantage to keep their hatchling alive and fed until it is ready to molt. Molting allows the dragon to grow to the next developmental stage, increasing its size, strength, and abilities. Continued growth unlocks new racial abilities, such as breath attacks and flight!<br/><br/><br/>Dragons are able to build their own race-unique structure, the nest. It functions as a respawn point, storage, and is required to molt to their next life stage. Multiple nests can be built, offering different storage and respawn locations across the island. Nests can be destroyed, so it is best to hide them in hard-to-reach locations.<br/><br/><br/>Dragons can ingest nuggets of rare metals to fuel their fiery breath weapon. Devastate your foes with this powerful attack and bring the lesser races to their knees. The rarer the metals consumed, the more powerful attack.<br/><br/><br/>After growing their wings, dragons can begin mastering the controls of flight. Launch yourself into the air with a running start, then beat your wings to speed up, bank to turn, and flare them to slow down. However, air speed must be maintained or you risk falling from the sky.<br/><br/><br/>Dragon have superior senses and because of this are able to navigate their surroundings, even during the darkest nights. They also possess the unique ability to sense deposits of rare metals buried underneath the surface of the ground, allowing them to harvest the nuggets they require for their abilities and molting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Driven to the seas by the advancing raknar threat, you and you fellow refugees seek out a new land to call home. A terrible typhoon over-takes your inexperienced crew and your ship is dashed upon the rocky shoals in the darkness of night. Nearly drowned by the waves, you make it to shore with your life intact and little else. Can you use your skills to survive, or will you join your fellow passengers in the afterlife?<br/><br/><br/>Humans are able to gather raw resources from their environment and turn them into various items, tools, and equipment to improve their survival situation. They can also research improvements to the items they craft using our improvement system. <br/><br/><br/>Along with the ability to craft their own tools and equipment, humans also have access to our 3D structure design system where they can draft a 3D model of a structure and create a blueprint of their building. These blueprints are needed to begin the construction of buildings.<br/><br/><br/>Humans do not have natural abilities, instead they must rely on their skills to reach their goals. Skills are improved with use and can be enhanced through perk choices earned as they increase the skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Trapped underground by the devious humans generations ago, you and your hive mates explore the ancient volcanic tubes in search of new ways to the world above. An earthquake collapses the tunnel behind you, but opens a new way to the surface. As you skitter your way into the daylight, you find yourself surrounded by ocean. Cut off from the Hive, can you evolve to dominate this new land, or will it dominate you?<br/><br/><br/>Raknar are born with full use of all their natural abilities. For combat, they have impressive, scythe-like strikers. In addition, their silk can be used to set traps for prey or as treatment for life-threatening wounds. Six legs give them an advantage in speed, and heavy chitin protects them from most minor damage. Take on the role of the lone hunter, or work together with your friends to create a hive that dominates the isles!<br/><br/><br/>Raknar are able to evolve each of their natural abilities by simply doing what raknar do best, hunting and killing and they do it in real time. Watch as your raknar grows in size, gains armor around its body and menacing barbs sprout from its strikers.<br/><br/><br/>Raknar are the only race able to cling and move effortlessly over most surfaces. This includes slopes that cannot be traversed by the other races, including vertical and even inverted surfaces! This adds a whole new dynamic to combat!<br/><br/><br/>As a raknar you will be able to penetrate the darkest of nights and caves thanks to your fully functional night vision that you can turn on and off at will. Become a true hunter of the night!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7afed9ca2f9ac9bcc613836e18bacf3b.jpg", "website": "http://trialsofascension.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Forged Chaos"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Forged Chaos"], "esrb_rating": null}
