Now let's dive deeper into the game's specifics:</p>\n<p><strong>Society </strong>is a local-multiplayer game <strong>with 2 or 3 players</strong>. Each player has their own main city and different resource vaults. Each city produces a bit of most materials, but that won't be enough if you want to reach the Sky! Using those resources, you need to start building <strong>\"excavators\"</strong>. <strong>\"Excavators\"</strong> are the buildings that can give you more of those basic materials. Then, when you have enough, you can start building <strong>\"Processors\"</strong>. They are the buildings that can <strong>\"process\"</strong> the basic resources and make some more<strong> high-end</strong> ones. Using those better resources, you can start doings some more exciting stuff. Keep in mind that, the whole time you were doing this, <strong>the other player/s</strong> were probably keeping an eye on you, and will most likely attack you as soon as you show a weakness. We would want to share more, but we don't want to spoil everything, so you will just have to play the game! Either way, let us reveal one more thing to you: The thing that makes <strong>Society </strong>different from other Strategies, are <strong>cards.\u00a0<br/></strong>There are <strong>50+ cards </strong>in the game, that can all help <strong>you get that win. Cards</strong> can be won in a lot of different ways. Some of them are:<br/><strong>1. Winning challenges<br/>2. Getting more wins<br/>3. Buying them from the shop with the in-game golden coins<br/></strong></p>\n<p>We are planning to make some more updates to this game, including:<br/><strong>1. Better and more animations<br/>2. A lot more cards<br/>3. Some new features to enhance game experience<br/>4. Maybe even some networking solutions, so we can make this game local or even massive multiplayer. This means that, you will be able to play the game with people from the other side of the world.<br/>5. And a lot of bug-fix releases, balance-patches and technical updates</strong></p>\n<p>Either way, that was <strong>all from us for now</strong>! We surely do not want to spoil anything more to you, so you can enjoy this game to its full extent. Also, stay on <strong>standbye </strong>for the updates, that will be <strong>announced </strong>on <strong>all of our social media</strong>, which you can check out!\u00a0We\u00a0hope you decided to try the game and that you will like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:20:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04ef739026e98281684a710ad89802cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sinest"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
