For example, a whole tree looks like a branch and a branch looks like a leaf.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, one can try making trees using self-similar mathematical structures called fractals.</p>\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_canopy\r\n<p>However, these mathematical structures does not look exactly like real trees. First, they lack randomness which is always present in nature. Second, real trees are not completely self-identical: different levels of structure follow different rules.</p>\n<p>In this editor you can generate your own tree-like structure. Define fractal's properties (length, width, amount of branches, colour, randomness, etc.) for the whole structure or for the separate levels individually.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use the left and the right mouse buttons for different effects.</p>\n\r\nShortcuts:\r\n<p>[0]\u00a0-- [7]\u00a0 Menu selection.</p>\n<p>[F4] Save tree image.</p>\n<p>[F5] Copy all tree settings to the clipboard.</p>\n<p>[F6] Load tree settings from the clipboard. Settings should be in the specific format.</p>\n<p>[F9]\u00a0 Resample all random effects.</p>\n\r\nCredits and source code\r\n<p>Mikhail Shubin, 2021\r\n</p>\n<p>Made with pygame,\u00a0published with\u00a0cx-Freeze\r\n</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/2pi360/tree_maker\r\n</p>\n<p>Uses pygame simplifier:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/2pi360/pygame_simplifier</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76bd89f69f5433b98373da965abe2f93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mikhail Shubin"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
