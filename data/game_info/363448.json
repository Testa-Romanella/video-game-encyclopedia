{"id": 363448, "slug": "thiefs-roulette", "name": "Thief's Roulette (itch)", "name_original": "Thief's Roulette (itch)", "description": "<p>Thief's Roulette is a Story-Driven Puzzle game inspired by the Zero Escape and Danganronpa game series. The game is being developed for PC and Nintendo\u00a0Switch. Thief's Roulette takes the narrative heavy design of Visual Novels and combines it with immersive, first person Puzzle gameplay to create a unique gaming experience.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You awake in a strange place surrounded by unfamiliar faces. You and 14 others have\u00a0been kidnapped and forced to compete for your lives in a series of challenges, hosted by a mysterious woman called\u00a0<strong>Lady Luck</strong>. When the group is split into 3 Teams you learn the horrible truth of this game; To win means to sentence your opponents to death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lady Luck proclaims these 15 strangers to be Thieves. And for this reason, she has brought them here, to fight for their life. They must complete <strong>all 7 of Lady Luck's Challenges</strong>. As the\u00a0game goes on, the more Thieves die. In the end, only those left alive will be allowed to leave the game.</p>\r\nLady\u00a0Luck's Game\r\n<p>Before each of Lady Luck's <strong>7 Challenges</strong>, the 15 Contestants are randomly assigned to 3 Teams. From there, they will enter their respective <strong>Challenge Rooms</strong> and attempt to complete the task the fastest. The catch, is that both 2nd and 3rd Place Teams will have to take part in the Marking Roulette. Members of these 2 teams are randomly Marked for Death. If you are ever Marked twice, you will be Executed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the 2nd Place team, the Roulette spins once. Only one player in that Team will end up with a Mark. For the 3rd Place team, the Roulette spins twice. With two spins, two players will be marked, or one player could be marked twice...</p>\n<p>When a Team gets 1st Place, one Player from that team is randomly selected to receive the\u00a0<strong>Trade Token</strong>. The 3rd Place Team will have one Player randomly selected to receive the\u00a0<strong>Reroll Token</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>The Trade Token can only be used right after the Teams have been scrambled. With this Token you may swap places with anyone else on any Team.\u00a0The Reroll Token can only be used right after the Marking Roulette. With it, you may choose to Reroll the Marking process. Perhaps for a more ideal result.</p>\n<p>These Tokens can only be used once. You are allowed to give, trade or steal Tokens. You are also not obligated to ever use them. That choice is yours. At certain points in the game <strong>You (the Player)</strong> will receive these Tokens. <strong>How, when, or if at all you choose to use them will have an impact on the game\u2019s story.</strong></p>\n<p>--</p>\r\nThe 15\u00a0Thieves\r\n\n<p><strong>Morgan | Viktoria | <em>Protagonist </em>| Ice | Ruby</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>M | Alise | Li | Lillian | Roland</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Isaac | Adhira | Joy | Inamori | Roger</strong><br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\r\nGameplay/Features\r\n<ul><li>Player Choices that can alter the path of the Story.</li><li>Complex and Dynamic Puzzles to Solve.</li><li>Immersive First Person Gameplay</li><li>Fully Explorable\u00a0Escape Rooms with VN Style Artwork.</li><li>A cast of unique characters with their own goals and personalities.</li></ul>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Thief's Roulette is still in early development.
