Chromatching is about matching shapes of the same color, in order to complete the challenges in each level. Simple right?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever we have added a good touch of creativity, since you will be able to change the color of the shapes, push them to change their position, or even remove them during the game, using the special objects that will appear in some levels. Besides, some challenges require you to do just the opposite -not to match the shapes to complete them-. The time to achieve the challenges is limited, so you will have to be fast!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to the challenges, each level has a rank of achievements that will allow you to know your best marks: maximum score, number of destroyed shapes, number of combos, best combos, time, etc. This way you will keep track of your improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd we have included a catchy soundtrack and some nice sound effects to achieve an immersive experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T04:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c9/9c9698be29d5db31130f42e91b7bf290.jpg", "website": "https://bunchybits.com/chromatching-en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bunchybits"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["bunchybits"], "esrb_rating": null}
