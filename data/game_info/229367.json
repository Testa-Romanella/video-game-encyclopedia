You and your opponents start the game with precisely equal resources. Quick reflexes will get you nowhere. The only path to victory is through clever strategy. <br/><br/>Auralux features a slow, floating feel and vibrant minimalistic graphics. The entire game pulses to the rhythm of ambient music, and the player's actions evoke sounds that smoothly coalesce into melody. <br/><br/>This game is designed to provide a relaxing, cerebral experience. Every choice matters, and only the best strategies will succeed. <br/><br/>Features:<br/>-Includes every feature and more from the renowned PC game.<br/>-Free to try for as long as you like!
