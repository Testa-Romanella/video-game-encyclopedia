For example, you can:</p>\n<p>- use an epic grappling hook to zip around levels</p>\n<p>- travel through space and time to fulfill your destiny</p>\n<p>- play through 9 rage inducing levels</p>\n<p>- eat bamboo</p>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanics/Inspiration\r\n<p>The theme of the Beginner's Circle Jam #3 was A Different Planet. Different planets have different gravity, right? So I decided to make the gravity change depending on the level, as well as implementing mechanics that I thought would be fun with low gravity. These include:</p>\n<p>- grappling hook</p>\n<p>- bounce pads</p>\n<p>- double jumping</p>\n<p>That's all for now! Have fun and don't forget to tell me what you think about it! I love you all so much!!!\u2605~(\u25e0\u25b3\u2299\u273f)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T05:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c2709f923883cfea8da5a414c761845a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamer Hangout"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
