Save the ship before the sea monsters take control over it!<br/></p>\n<p>Pirate Codex can be a challengeful singleplayer or a fun\u00a0co-op game with your friends. Fight against monsters while moving your characters\u00a0together.\r\n</p>\n<p>The two character has a rope between them and they are trying to catch the monsters with it, but be careful, if the characters are too far away from eachother the rope breaks.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are bosses, upgrades, potions and abilities!</p>\n<p><strong>Use WASD and Arrows to control the two character. 1-4 numbers are for potions and abilities and T button is the pause. Thats all :D\r\n</strong><strong>The game has controller support so you can play with controllers too!</strong></p>\n<p>I am really curious about the community's opinion about my first game, I hope you have a great time with this game. Ideas and critics are appreciated, I would love to hear them both to make the game better :)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>You must ask permission if you want to upload this game on your own website.</strong>\u00a0<br/><strong>Contact :</strong>\u00a0nagy.patrik291103@gmail.com</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Pixel Arts:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- Pixel Frog\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0Lynda Mc Donald\r\n<br/>\r\n- LuizMelo\r\n<br/>\r\n- Kronovi-\r\n<br/>\r\n- Narik The Artist\r\n<br/>\r\n- Zacksly\r\n<br/>\r\n-\u00a0Ark</p>\n<p>Music:\r\n<br/>\r\n- Shane Ivers\u00a0(The Buccaneer's Haul)\r\n<br/>\r\n- Ross Bugden\u00a0(Pirate Crew)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T07:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b2/4b26aea27f20512a15d37d81ae09a760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alien299 | Patrik Nagy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
