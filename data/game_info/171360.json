This game is created by an Independent Developer that goes by the nickname Vorezii or by the real name Teevint Prak. The game is about you as a player, a cube moving towards a straight platform and dodging or evading the red obstacles. Yes I'll make a more interesting story but this is it for now. still in Pre-Beta. More things such as options menu and other interesting levels will be added.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Powered By Unity 5D</p>\n<p>Educated By Brackeys\u00a0and my friend Ishan/Ithinker.</p>\n<p>Music Provided By : Craze Music,Asset Store</p>\n<p>VERSION 1.0!!!!(EndLess Level\u00a0is unfortunately scraped).</p>\n<p>SKIN CHANGER</p>\n<p>SHOP SYSTEM</p>\n<p>COIN SYSTEM</p>\n<p>These 3 are the 3 things that sets my game different the one of brackeys. These functions\u00a0is the one I put my upmost effort in.</p>\n<p>Levels Organized and Fixed.</p>\n<p>(There isn't much or\u00a0any\u00a0difference in graphics between low and high graphic option, So using lower graphic settings while playing is suggested.) Trust me, I made this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(EndLess level, was too hard to make for my current knowledge and it is very computer heavy). My pc is I5 6400, RX 480 and 8Gb of ram. Soooooo.</p>\n<p>Thanks you for 30 Downloads. The game is now 99% done.</p>\n<p>Office computers can choose Medium and High and Ultra will be for good computers.\u00a0\"WARNING\" endless level is very buggy on High and Ultra, even if you have a good PC. if you want to play endless get turn down the settings to medium and lower to protect yourself.
