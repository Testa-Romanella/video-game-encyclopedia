Nobody knows how or why. You two are detectives, a surly alcoholic ex-cop and a resourceful hacker. You are freelance detectives, which is another word for not really detectives. Nonetheless, you're trying to get to the crime scene.</p><p>This is a gameplay demo/art test for a co-op detective adventure with platforming elements, part of the 2014 INDIGO showcase. It was mainly a first stab at tackling the concept, seeing if the conversation system worked, and having a go at the combined art style. We are now working at a proper version of MmM which won't resemble this version very much. Nevertheless.</p><p>Notes and instructions:</p><p>-This is a co-op game so summon a friend and make sure you have two XBOX controllers plugged in beforehand.</p><p>-The conversation system works like this: Both players select a response and a randomizer picks one for each round of conversation. Leading to a partly-generative partly-controlled conversation.</p><p>-This wasn't finished or wholly bug-free when we demoed it and it isn't now.</p><p>WRITER/DESIGNER/CHARACTER ARTIST: Ernst-Jan van Melle</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL/TOTAL ARTIST: Leon Tukker</p><p>CORE CODE: Martijn Postma</p><p>ADDITIONAL CODE/SOUND DESIGN: Joost Bos</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec76a6a9aa2ea9c89d1dc242e043282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ernst-Jan van Melle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
