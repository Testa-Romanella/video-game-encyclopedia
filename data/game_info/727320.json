{"id": 727320, "slug": "gunpey-ds-2", "name": "Gunpey (DS)", "name_original": "Gunpey (DS)", "description": "<p>Gunpey requires players to arrange line segments to complete lines across five columns, removing the row in the process. However, the lines work their way up the screen, and if an incomplete line should reach the top, the player&#39;s game is over.</p>\n<p>The DS take on Gunpey makes extensive use of the system&#39;s stylus. Players will be able to move an on-screen cursor and erase panels, altering the music. With enough practice, players can time their moves with the background music to create original compositions. The DS has two basic play modes: Endless Mode and Frontier Mode. In Frontier, the player faces a variety of opponent characters, such as Vincent the Space Cowboy. Needless to say, completing rows will disrupt your opponent&#39;s side of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-26T04:02:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf65fadd0d418a6bde4a92234a8fe20.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Q Entertainment"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
