He loves making fun of others at school and shows no respect towards anyone except his family.\u00a0At home he is\u00a0a completely\u00a0different person. Especially towards his mother he is so kindhearted he wouldn't even think of being mean or making a mess in his house.<br/><br/>The day before christmas as he falls asleep in his favorite pyjamas he wakes up in an odd, cold place. Where is he? How did he get there? He's got to find a way home as soon as possible.\u00a0 He does not want to be late for christmas - the best day of the year!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Thank you for visiting this Page and have fun!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>All sounds used from\u00a0</em>Epidemic Sound<em>\u00a0&amp;\u00a0</em>we\u2764\ufe0findies</p>\n<p>Also thanks to everyone who helped me with this project!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T07:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d703d1afe82ebba7c2e1257526c000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninsn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
