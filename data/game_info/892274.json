If you have to copy paste code all over the place, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u00a0 Another thing that I learned from this project was to keep everything very well-organized because it is easier to change the sequence of certain events when every event is kept well organized.\u00a0 This was mostly applicable to the design process of the cutscenes and dialogue system.</p>\n<ul><li>Dylan:\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\tPersonally, I learned that I need to be better at communicating.\u00a0 During the duration of this project, I was consistently busy with other classes, my job, and needing to practice my instrument, which meant that I did not set aside enough time for this project and I was not properly communicating with my teammates about the project.\u00a0 Fortunately, I was able to salvage the issues with my teammates and we were able to come together to finish this really cool game!\r\n</p>\n<p>\tI also learned how to do some coding that I did not learn in classes.\u00a0 We were not taught how to make a menu system or a \u201cfog of war\u201d effect.\u00a0 I took the time to learn these efforts from other sources from the internet.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Anna:\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\tI was working on the art part, and the pixel style painting was a big challenge for me. I had never tried this style of painting before.\r\n</p>\n<p>It was also important to communicate with my teammates. Everyone is responsible for different parts of the project, so it's important to give each other advice when creating.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing our game!!!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:20:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7ca2ceaea7811f708ecd9debd0d447c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aaaaaaanxiety"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
