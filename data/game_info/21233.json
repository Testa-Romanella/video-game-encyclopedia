Breath of Death VIII is a 2D adventure in the best traditions of role-playing games of the late 80&#39;s, early 90&#39;s from the American studio Zeboyd Games. The studio consists of only two people: Robert Boyd and William Stiernberg. The title is a reference to the number parts of Final Fantasy, in fact, the previous 6 of the Breath of Death parts do not exist.</p>\n<p>The player follows the adventures of Dem the Skeleton Knight, Lita the Vampire Techie and Erik the Zombie Prince. Each can be customized using upgrades from the branching skill-tree.</p>\n<p>The developers wanted to abandon the most annoying element in the classic RPGs - turn-based combat and endless random encounters. Therefore, the game uses a hybrid combo system that takes into account several important parameters: the character is chosen and how many moves have already been made. Also, the number of random enemy-encounters in one location is limited to a certain number.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T00:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/470/47007a1d93022e6210c3af8a3c5b52a7.jpg", "website": "http://zeboyd.com/2010/02/01/breath-of-death-vii-the-beginning/", "rating": 2.68, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 95, "owned": 1513, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 42}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zeboyd Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zeboyd Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
