Levels present physical obstacles that must be conquered by moving beams of light that create solid platforms, allowing the player to maneuverer themselves towards the exit.<br />\nThe game challenges you to make your way through chambers utilising mechanics that make you think about your environment in ways you&#39;ve never done before.<br />\nSet in a mysterious void, Dark Light is very streamlined, and places the central focus on the puzzles in front of you without distractions. You must run, jump, press buttons, flick levers, move objects and even take photos to carve your path to freedom.<br />\nAs you progress, you will be introduced to new items and objects which will add another layer of complexity to the game&#39;s core mechanic.<br />\n36 Levels will keep you busy for hours. The further you get, the more complex the puzzles become. This will stretch your puzzle solving abilities to the limit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-10T07:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c98c11bbb3f61c3b0b056e1366e3f6f.jpg", "website": "https://www.darklight-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 55, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mirari&Co.", "b2studios", "Mirari"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mirari&Co.", "b2studios", "Mirari", "Co., Maple Whispering"], "esrb_rating": null}
