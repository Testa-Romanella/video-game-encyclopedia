{"id": 974032, "slug": "triadino", "name": "Triadino", "name_original": "Triadino", "description": "Triadino is a casual puzzle game inspired by Tetris and Rock-Paper-Scissors. This game is played with randomly generated triplets (triominos) of three different types of blocks: Rock, Paper and Scissors. The unique interactions between different block types upon placement make the game more interesting and challenging.<br/><br/>Like in Tetris, the triomino generated in each turn will fall to the bottom of the game board, and the player can move and rotate the triomino so that it can be placed in a particular position and orientation upon reaching existing blocks.<br/><br/>However unlike in Tetris, upon placement on existing blocks, additional operations will take place between triomino blocks and the blocks below them. Based on the block types, the triomino blocks may cancel out or replace the blocks below them, and after block cancellation, the remaining block(s) may further fall down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Triadino has three game modes: Casual, Regular and Challenging, plus two leveling up modes: Line Clearing and Full Clearing. These modes determine the falling speed of the triominos and the speed increment when the game levels up. They also determine the number of rows of initial blocks generated in the Full Clearing level up mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Triadino can be played in either the single player (Solo) mode or the double player (Dual) mode. The Dual mode can be played by two players on the same computer with a shared screen, or on different computers within the same intranet. The Dual mode has two sub-modes: Parallel and Adversarial. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Triadino supports two types of computer players: Easy and Hard. One can choose to play against a computer player, or let one computer player to play by itself, or let two computer players to play against each other just for fun.<br/><br/>Enjoy the game! Also the game provides a number of nicely animated backgrounds for you to enjoy!<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T08:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/53378c8d0131a2a8087aaff0ac8ce247.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeoVoxel Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeoVoxel Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
