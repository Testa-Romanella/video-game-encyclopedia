You will be exploring different levels of dungeons full of traps and enemies but more importantly LOOT ! In between raids you can use the loot to buy new equipment and fun potions to help you with your adventure.</p>\n<p>The game is a small demonstration of what I learned about Unreal Engine. The game is made with C++ and a bit of blueprints, all the 3D and UI assets are made in Blender. All the work, apart from the sounds, has been done by me.</p>\n<p>Have fun with it, enjoy and please tell me what you think of it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d2/7d2a5547fc9835e9054954ad2917225a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AntonGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
