Designed in 1983 by Mel Croucher, the British videogame pioneer, this bizarre graphically-augmented text-adventure for the ZX Spectrum showcased Mel's unique brand of humour. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Using simple text commands, move around Hollywood searching for Groucho and his friend the Piman. Fat cigars are your currency, and can be won by doing things like gambling at a casino or betting on horses. Finding Groucho gives you chances to have hints revealed to you about a certain celebrity figure. When this game was originally released, players could send in their mystery celebrity name guesses to the game's publisher, Automata UK, to be entered into a prize draw for a trip to Hollywood on Concorde! Unfortunately, players of this version will be a little late to the party, as the prize was already won back in 1984 by Phil Daley from Stoke-on-Trent.<br/><br/><br/>This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including:<br/><br/><ul><li> Saving/loading the game at any point<br/></li><li> Support for most modern game controllers<br/></li><li> Full control remapping<br/></li><li> Image scaling and smoothing options</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T03:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed0f2705e62e73b514a3a49c51d25e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Automata UK"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Pixel Games UK"], "esrb_rating": null}
