This is my very first demo/prototype! I am a new indie developer and I've been learning game design, the Godot engine, and pixel art on my own. There is no sound or music in this very early version.\u00a0<br/>you are a mad scientist who combines different types of DNA to create monsters. Click on the vials that you want to combine and press the button to create the monster and then click the button once more to destroy the monster. Combinations of DNA can be 1, 2 or 4 right now. It's very early and limited but this is just a start.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Now that I've done this first portion of the game, I\u00a0will post many updates with new features, gameplay mechanics, and yes even sound!\u00a0<br/>Planned updates include:<br/>\u00a0overhaul to the graphics.<br/>sound and music.<br/>more DNA and Monster types.<br/>Levels where you can take the monsters you create and destroy cities!</p>\n<p>Known issues:<br/> If you press the button after selecting 3 vials, you will get the wrong monsters because I\u00a0didn't program any 3 vial combinations. I'm working on a fix right now. For now, just click the button twice to clear all the monsters out.\u00a0<br/><br/>Sometimes if you click on a vial and press the button without pressing it twice to clear it, a monster will get stuck. This should be fixed in later versions.<br/><br/>If you find any other bugs, just leave a comment. I\u00a0will be blogging here soon about my journey in learning game development and development progress of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:48:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1af/1aff2281564d6007f9f8881efa496266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jaboc1234"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
