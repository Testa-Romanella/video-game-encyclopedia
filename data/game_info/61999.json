{"id": 61999, "slug": "king-randalls-party", "name": "King Randall's Party", "name_original": "King Randall's Party", "description": "King Randall\u2019s Party is a game about building castles, filling them with MacGuyver-esque traps, and trying to survive wave after wave of relentless enemy attacks as they try to break into your fortress and get to your precious, precious gold pile. If too many get through, you lose! Whatever your strategy is, from building the smallest and most efficient defensive fortifications, to building sprawling mega-castles, you will have the freedom to approach each challenge in a manner as unique as you are.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this side-view 2D tower defense game players take the role of the Royal Treasurer who has stolen all of the Kingdom's treasure in order to prevent the King from throwing a frivolous party celebrating the tenth year of his reign. The player must build a castle block-by-block and trap-by-trap in order to prevent the King's army from retaking the gold! The King will send devilishly smart units from his army to retake the stolen gold; they will build ladders and bridges, scale your walls, and knock them down in order to achieve their objective.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-15T10:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d8506ad96fab12d4bc6c534f4b2578.jpg", "website": "https://www.kingrandallsparty.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gorilla Tactics", "GorillaOne"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gorilla Tactics"], "esrb_rating": null}
