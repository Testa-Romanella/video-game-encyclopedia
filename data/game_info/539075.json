{"id": 539075, "slug": "robosquare", "name": "RoboSquare", "name_original": "RoboSquare", "description": "<h3>ROBOSQUARE</h3><br/>Jump into speedy hazard-packed robo battles with up to 15 other players where random series of synchronized events destroy the fighting arena. Everyone zooms around the level bumping, drifting, and flipping to become the ultimate winner by being the last one standing in an ongoing stage of madness. Join a sumo-inspired experience with a rush of energetic motor buzz where even the hardest hits and coolest tricks might not save you from the mayhem on the screen.<br/><br/>There is no lack of insane collisions in Robosquare! From a massive pile-up at the start of a sumo match to crazy 1v1 controlled clashes, the gameplay is nothing short of electronic warfare. Grow your momentum and deliver that deafening blow to anyone standing in your way.<h3>GAME MODES</h3>Enjoy variations of two main game modes, sumo and race. Within each match, the core gameplay of thrusting others out of the map doesn't change. Yet, different tasks within each game mode will get you customization currency known as scrap. While racing, hit epic jumps, maneuver around obstacles, and take caution of dangerous timed events to reach the finish line first. If fate spawns you into a sumo deathmatch, navigate the actively changing platforms with the might of your driving skills. Keep in mind; only one bot will be victorious. Do not be surprised when among the mayhem of constantly dropping platforms, other players will ram you from all directions hoping to knock you off into the abyss.<h3>CUSTOMIZATIONS</h3><br/>Show your style with your very own customization! Catch your enemies off guard with an aggressive art style calling them into battle. Receive honorary items only the most elite robot drivers possess through the earning of scrap. From a Zen garden body to snow-globe wheels, you may use this in-game currency to completely redesign the look of your rig.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/7719b630ab9e7d45042f360becd4afa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fizzostia"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fizzostia"], "esrb_rating": null}
