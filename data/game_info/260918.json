I have no idea what causes that and it doesn't happen in the standalone version. Also, I noticed that, at least on my own setup, having a Youtube video open caused the frame rate to stutter, but your mileage may vary.)</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>[Depending on your keyboard, you may run into some Dropped Inputs. This is caused by the actual hardware you're working with. Most keyboards can only handle about 3-6 keys pressed at a time. I recommend\u00a0using some gamepads, or maybe even multiple USB keyboards (though you still need to make sure that each player is using Different Keys, because Unity can't differentiate between the Keyboards.)]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sequinox! Start Your Engines!</strong></p>\n<p>Grab 1-3 of your friends/acquaintances/enemies/trustworthy strangers and face off on the track! That's right! It's a Kart-Racing Game based on your favorite Magical Girl Actual Play Podcast, Sequinox!</p>\n<p><strong>6 Playable Racers!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>More Racers than you can have in a race at once, and each has different stats! Choose your favorite and have some fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Controller Support! Kinda!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Control Remapping with support for controller buttons, but not the analog sticks. So if you can find a work around you like, go for it!
