My design goal was to invoke feelings of nostalgia based on point-and-click games from the 2000\u2019s, along with ideas of hope through color contrast.</p>\n<p>I started out with a monochromatic black-and-white palette to convey feelings of monotony and isolation. While coding, I realized that the palette was too boring so I touched up the clickable objects with colors that were neutral, but distinct. I wanted to guide the player from the TV, to the dull bed, and up to the window.<br/></p>\n<p>My choice of clickable objects was intended to hook the viewer in with nostalgic aesthetics, giving them the curiosity to explore. I added to the nostalgic aesthetic with the hand-drawn art style, portraying a childlike perspective. Despite the TV playing a Nintendo 64 game, I also decided to put a Nintendo Entertainment System  console instead in order for the player to connect with the nostalgia theme easier. As the player loops through the experience, they start to piece together a positive message: No matter how dull our surroundings can be, our interactions can make them brighter through learning from the past, reorganization, and persistence.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Challenges</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A challenge I had while making my interactive experience was programming a button class that would allow arrays to shift through image files. Since I sorted my image files into arrays, I had to create a class in order to have the index move whenever the player clicked on the displayed image. The problems I faced with creating the class were in understanding the \u201cconstructor()\u201d method and re-evaluating the logic in the \u201cupdate.()\u201dmethod. The p5.js programs from Paolo Pedercini and Daniel Shiffman served as a helpful basis for my own button class. I managed to create a functional class, but due to time constraints, I left a minor bug that prevents the rain sound from playing in the beginning. I\u2019ll chalk it up as a lesson to improve my coding skills going forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Waiting out the Storm was inspired by how I coped with the COVID-19 lockdown. During the first three months, I pulled all-nighters replaying old DS games from my childhood. As I look back at that time, I question what life would have been like if a situation similar to the pandemic happened earlier. What if it happened in a time (say the late 1990\u2019s, early 2000\u2019s) when forms of long-distance communication did not advance to the ones we use today (e.g. smartphones, Discord, etc.)?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>p5.js source codes obtained from Paolo Pedercini and Daniel Shiffman</p>\n<p>Super Mario 64 is intellectual property of Nintendo</p>\n<p>Sound effects downloaded from Freesound<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:08:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e6/0e6455023c75c5513f97e2d7bae9e328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mijaande"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
