It is all going on above your head as you walk the planet surface. Night becomes day as planets orbit the sun. Hundreds of asteroids fly with their own trajectories. We even simulate temperature and atmospheric resistance, and there is no cheating involved.<br/>The player is free to do anything within the confines of the simulation. You can...<br/><ul><li>...spontaneously exit the ship inside a busy asteroid field!<br/></li><li>...fly to the sun and melt your ship!<br/></li><li>...tow a giant mushroom and put it into orbit around the sun!<br/></li><li>...ride a sofa into a black hole!</li></ul>Only your failures and imagination set the limits!Rookie ModeIn Rookie mode it is possible for players of different skill levels to play together. Parents can play with their young children. Or gamers can play with their less talented parents and siblings. We want the whole family to be able to play ADIOS Amigos together.
