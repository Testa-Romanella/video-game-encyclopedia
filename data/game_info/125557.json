After so many friends had a blast playing what I was working on before completion; I simply couldn't let them down on having their own copy! Now you can bring this to your own PC in all its wonky and cheesy goodness. Take on the generic \"Evil Wizard Dude\" as you battle against 5 monster types using various weapons, armor, and spells. Level up to a maximum of level 5 and destroy all who stand between you and freedom!</p>\n<p>!!UPDATE!! If you receive a DirectX error, try this (since I don't think I'm legally allowed to just pack it into the .zip :P )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ae/1ae3943f0d7f4c8ff3316c25c7d3eeaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xarcolt"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
