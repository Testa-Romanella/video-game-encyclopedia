This was a really exciting project as I was able to work with and record a live string quartet. The initial composition, scoring and recording process was a collaborative work with another student from the class, but the mixing, post-production and game implementation was an individual task.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game features a maze that is divided into two halves. One side of the maze, that leads to the exit, is accompanied by positive music that builds in intensity. The other side however, is accompanied by negative music that intensifies as you get more and more lost inside the maze. This project was designed to explore how music can provide feedback to a player in a game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game provided by the Game Audio Institute</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T07:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d304b25491e03cd830e698309a41f1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MVS"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
