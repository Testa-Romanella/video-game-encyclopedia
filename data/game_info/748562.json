The game will be focused around that idea, but will have what we hope to be an engaging and interesting plot, and that you will enjoy it not only for the hentai.<br />\nThe game will follow four female champions from League, we chose four as a manageable number so we can properly develop their relationships and not feel like a cheap porn movie acting.<br />\nThe main antagonists will be OCs because we felt that will be better than trying to bend existing ones to fill that role, but they do still make sense in the whole lore of the world.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-03T15:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89e/89e192d9a9447615ea6c55f00d891d51.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/hreinngames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
