It's something I'd never touched on before and I enjoyed the learning experience. The story isn't that polished and there's only one level as I had to create both the art and music as well. I plan on developing this game in the future and really enjoyed creating it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/7784caebb045d2a9da387607bf919c39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Not A Bot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
