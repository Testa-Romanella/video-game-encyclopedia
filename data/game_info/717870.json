Funnily enough, our combined skills cover all areas needed to create a game. My eldest brother Mikhail is taking care of music and SFX, And my other brother Bato takes care of visual elements(Character design, UI design, etc). As for me, I'm a programmer -\u00a0I took care of all the logic, blockchain, and frontend.</p>\n<p>This project was our first attempt at making a game, and we hope you enjoy the experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:44:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a8d459c5842709eb59c05b7323cdc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThreeBrothers"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
