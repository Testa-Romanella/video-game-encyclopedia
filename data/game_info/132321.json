Put bluntly, the games in that jam are intentionally hard and antagonistic towards the player. Death Masque is a puzzle game and one where no rules are presented to the player. Instead they must use visual cues and trial and error to figure out the rules for each room to progress. The setting is based off of Edgar Allan Poe's Masque of the Red Death.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>SPACE - Start Game</li>\n<li>ARROW KEYS - Move</li>\n<li>ESCAPE - Reset</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>DIRECTIONS</strong>\n</p><p>\r\nNo information regarding the rules is presented to the player on purpose. The only controls are movement using the arrow keys and the player is tasked with figuring out how to complete each room on their own. The game is timed and the player must complete all rooms as quickly as possible. Good luck!\r\n</p><p>\r\nBuilt in Unity with music by Pixel8ter<br/>\r\n\tby Chris Hoopes &amp; Dustin Twilley<br/>October, 2014\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/745/745ebbb50b8a19fe3ce88bef497faa49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghost Crab Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
