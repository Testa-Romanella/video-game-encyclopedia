When you have placed your arrows, you can summon the ball by touching the beacon. If the ball does not touch any arrow, it will only be affected by gravity. Once the ball is in play, it\u2019s no longer possible to move the arrows, but it\u2019s possible to press the beacon to reset the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Play without frustration</strong><br/>---<br/>We know that there is nothing worse than getting stuck in a level and not being able to continue. To avoid this frustration, it's possible to view the solution after 5 unsuccessful attempts in a level.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>--&gt; Intriguing gameplay<br/>--&gt; Multiple levels<br/>--&gt; Interesting in-game physics<br/>--&gt; Challenging levels<br/>--&gt; Simple and easy game controls<br/>--&gt; Suitable for all age groups<br/></p>\n<p>Share it with your friends and family members to have a lot of fun playing this game together.</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d48dc1e0068512599c4529131ec7d08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Warny Warn Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
