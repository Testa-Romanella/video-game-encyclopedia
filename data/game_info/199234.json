This one has to be one of the most important backstories called 'Skyward Flight' which suggests things like; flying into the sky or anything along those lines.<p>I never really drew anything to go along with this story so I don't have any concepts or ideas to continue this project with. However, I'll still 'wing' it and hope for the best.
