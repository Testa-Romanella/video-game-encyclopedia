You have what you assumed to be all of the items you needed in your cart and were about to proceed to checkout when you realized something. <strong>Something's missing </strong>from my cart. Shocked by this terrifying revelation you decide your only option is to run through the store and collect every single item in the building. \"Surely one of these has to be what I'm looking for\" you think to yourself. The security team here, however, do not approve of such behaviour. \"This is preposterous! How can one man need so many high quality products from our store,\" thought the security team. In order to allow other customers to purchase some products they decide they must stop you.</p>\n<p>Crank to move yourself around the store and collect items. Avoid the security team.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4bab39a54070689682d8dd49338967e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PossiblyAxolotl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
