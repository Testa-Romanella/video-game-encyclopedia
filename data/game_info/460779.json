However, one of the goals of this game is to humanize those who struggle with mental illness through some humor, genuine bonding between characters, and a narrative that aims to celebrate the simple joy of being alive.</p>\n<p>There is currently a demo out for both PC and Mac. The demo should take around thirty minutes to an hour to complete, while the final game will likely be five to six hours long.</p>\n<p>If you wish to follow the game's development, you can do so on the dev blog.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:12:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a76b4f3f778aa24dbf6f371040ece45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jay Grimalkind"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
