Every time you pull the trigger, the gun needs a correct percentage level set - and the only way you can work it out is with each given question or statistic. The further away from the correct setting you are, the more ammo the gun discharges and wastes.</p>\n<p>If you run out of ammo, scurry back and your captor will give you a refill... for a fee, of course.</p>\n<p>Presented with small amounts of humour, Rev%lver has a 97% chance of being fun!</p>\n<p>Created in 48 hours for GM48.</p>\n<p>Game: Allison\u00a0James<br/>Programming, art, music, SFX: Allison James<br/>Fonts: Dan Johnston (Aardvark Sk8)\u00a0and Allison\u00a0James (Front Page Supplement)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82b/82b6296dc35c4ce7dc11622219cb94b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
