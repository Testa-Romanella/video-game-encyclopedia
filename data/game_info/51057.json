Punch, block, and dodge your way up the ranks with simple one-hand touch controls and fast action gameplay. Time your dodges successfully and you'll be rewarded an opportunity for a knock-out punch. However, one mistimed maneuver can mean the difference between shining in the bright lights to being lights-out on the canvas!<br/><br/>As an up-and-coming boxer, career mode puts you in the action against 29 other completely randomly generated opponents so you'll never play the same career twice. Fight your way up the ranks and challenge three different title holders on your way to becoming the first undisputed champion of the world. After fights you'll earn money and experience to level up, upgrade stats, and choose between 12 unique abilities in the skill tree. The type of fighter that you want to become is entirely up to you and your playing style.<br/><br/>Can you become the greatest prizefighter to ever step into the ring?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-03T18:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/688dfeef96d6d958138fefaccb51325f.jpg", "website": "https://www.koalitygame.com/prizefighters", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Koality Game", "Justin Mai"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Koality Game", "Justin Mai"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
