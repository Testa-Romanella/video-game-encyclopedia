Place arrows to complete loops and clear them for points. Any un-cleared arrows at the end of a level will be bricked in and these bricks will need to be cleared.</p>\n<p>The default keybinds for PICO-8 controls are the arrow keys for the D-pad, x for the x button, and z and c both for the o button. Press Enter or Esc to pause and/or toggle music; press Ctrl +/- to adjust volume.</p>\n<p>(Strategy hint: A chain of arrows with one brick each can all be cleared just by activating the beginning of the line, but the second brick will stop the chain dead - be careful about long chains that you aren't clearing!)</p><p>(Footnote: Please let us know if you have any issues with any of the binaries! PICO-8 is a good piece of software, but we don't have our own Linux or MacOS machines to test on.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe8262024b0dd4ea291adbaabafd3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Packbat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
