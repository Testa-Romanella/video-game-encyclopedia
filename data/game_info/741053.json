In it, humans live eternally and life cannot be created and evolve.</p>\n\n<p>Your task is to free humans from the dangers\u00a0of the land and most importantly, save 'her' from a cycle of torment.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons and armors are present in this land. Never hesitate to use them.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a reminder of the controls:<br/></p>\n\r\nSPACE BAR<br/>Confirm / Interact<br/>W,A,S,DMovingSHIFT while Moving<br/>RunningARROW KEYS<br/>ShootingCONTROLView Character Stats<br/>ESCAPEAdmin Menu / Back<br/>\n<p> Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>One last thing. This software uses DirectX to work properly. If you haven't downloaded DirectX for your computer, I suggest you do so or look at the README for more details.</p>\n\n<p>--------------------------------<br/></p>\n\n<p>Download freely the soundtrack here!<br/><br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T10:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/9791fdac91cba6baac7eb794dc891a74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E-San"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
