A trial version is currently available. Check it out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gio and Niko wanted to share their design document and the AGK source code as free downloads. If you would like the Windows EXE version (it is the same as the version you can play on this page, but in EXE form), there is a nominal charge. All proceeds will probably end up going to Pokemon cards. :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T07:53:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b34cdaa2bbf3fe520703293137faef5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["LynxJSA"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
