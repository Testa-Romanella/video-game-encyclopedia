Created by an indie team of seasoned game developers, and designed by a Magic: the Gathering National Champion, it is easy to learn, yet challenging for veteran card game players.<br/><br/>One of Spellweaver's core gameplay features is hero development. During a game, your hero levels up, gains resources, and can develop <strong>additional hero skills</strong>, letting you craft the perfect hero to complement your deck's strategy.<br/><br/>Spellweaver's combat system features an innovative <strong>creature speed mechanic</strong>. Fast creatures allow you to dictate how combat goes, but they have generally weaker stats. Slower creatures are bigger and stronger, but they are also easy to outmaneuver.<br/><br/>Spellweaver's design allows for quick games, yet offers a huge number of combinations and paths to victory to explore. Join in and have endless hours of fun with this strategic card game created with a lot of passion!", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2016-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e2772d646a8600d0af912edc8b8e101.jpg", "website": "https://spellweaver-tcg.com", "rating": 2.59, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 486, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 14, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dream Reactor"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dream Reactor"], "esrb_rating": null}
