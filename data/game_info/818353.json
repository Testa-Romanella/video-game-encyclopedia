In order to increase your luck you\u2019re on the hunt for the 12-sided die. It\u2019s a giant fetch quest.\u00a0This was designed for the GMTK Game Jam\u2019s \u201cRoll The Dice\u201d prompt. Because I didn't have proper export profile I am uploading my completed Godot 4.4 project so at least there\u2019s something on time. It works entirely.</p>\n<p>This was built in the last 24 hours of the game jam as a challenge to see how fast and narrow I could implement the directive. The artwork, sounds, and music were built specifically for this game.\u00a0Thanks to Griffin Dziok and Nicholas Glenn for helping me out with a few assets!</p>\n<p>Since closing I\u00a0was able to publish builds. They are located here if you\u2019re interested\u00a0https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bbnshgyj7k6cuf9/AACBlllT2WTWYUOcf050aokXa?dl=0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43b5e37e1c582f9b89f3824ef62db8ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedestrian Tactics"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
