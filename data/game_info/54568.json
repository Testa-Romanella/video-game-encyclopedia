{"id": 54568, "slug": "world-cup-98-2", "name": "World Cup 98", "name_original": "World Cup 98", "description": "<p>World Cup 98 (known in Europe as FIFA World Cup 98) is the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997. Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, World Cup 98 used a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version. Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game engine is based on that of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning. The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals. World Cup 98 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901ef93d139d959833977c5f8f5d1e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.92, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 14, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Nintendo 64", "Game Boy", "PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Canada", "Tiertex Design Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["THQ", "EA SPORTS"], "esrb_rating": null}
