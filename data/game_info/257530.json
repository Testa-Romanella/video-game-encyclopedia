There are 6-8 colors to choose from. <br/>Your objective is to logically guess the combination of color in the correct sequence.<br/>You have 8 chances to guess it correct<br/>Tap the colored peg you want to place into the board<br/>Tap on the chosen peg on the board if you want to replace it with another peg<br/>If you are satisfied with the combination you have made, press the \"OK\" button on the right<br/>When you finished you combination, check the small pegs on the board's right side.<br/>* Black - right color, right space<br/>* White - right color, wrong space<br/>* Empty - wrong color, wrong space<br/>If you fail to guess the code in 8 tries, you lose and the correct pegs are revealed at the top of the game board.<br/><br/>The order of the result pegs has no correlation with the order of the guess pegs. The result pegs tell you how many guess pegs are correct, but not which ones.<br/><br/>SCORING:<br/>You get more points for less guesses, more balls, and more pegs. You get less points for using a hint.<br/><br/><br/>Can you crack the code?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:56:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba3d38c40aa163bde911c3b0d1a21bb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Craig Walker"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Craig Walker"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
