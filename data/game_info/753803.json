At first, the game presents you with \"the good guys\" and \"the bad guys\". However, as the story goes on, Ennith finds that not everything is as it seems. At a certain point, the story splits into two as Ennith must decide who to side with, and that decision is fully up to the player. What truth will you pursue?</p>\n<p><strong>What to Expect</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is currently in Alpha, which for this game specifically means the story is in active development.\u00a0Currently, there is over 10 hours of gameplay and the main story will take you all the way through chapter 5. I will say that there is a LOT of side content for those who enjoy that, and each of the boss fights have their own mechanics to figure out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: I have made several changes to the game since I first showed it off to some friends, but the early game is probably still the weakest. I fully wish and desire for any and all criticism\u00a0so I can make this game the best it can be. You are welcome to make any comments here, or, you can head over to our small\u00a0Discord\u00a0community and talk there!</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets!</strong></p>\n<p>There are... a LOT... of secrets in this game. And, it's not even close to finished yet! All the secret mechanics and whatnot are listed in the Discord, but here is a brief overview. For one, there are multiple ultra rare monster encounters, and they are split between three types. One gives you exp boosts, and the other two are different types of bosses. You can also obviously expect hidden loot and puzzles! Oh yeah, and the fact that almost every monster has an extremely rare drop that lets you use one of their abilities! I'm a big fan of optional grinding mechanics, (I love shiny hunting in Pok\u00e9mon),\u00a0 so that's why I've included all of these secrets. None of them are required of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Boss Fights</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I love making the boss fights. Each one is a joy for me. That being said, I didn't pull many punches for most of them. Since each have unique mechanics, the odds that you beat a boss on the first try are very low. Once you figure out what you need to do though, every boss is manageable. There are over 10 boss battles at this current point, and I hope you enjoy them all!\u00a0This brings me to the final note I want to make,</p>\n<p><strong>The Music</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am almost guaranteed\u00a0to have custom music in the future, but for now i do not. HOWEVER! I have a passion for game music, and to me, bad music can ruin the entire game. You'll find that each boss fight has a unique boss soundtrack made by many different talented artists who do remixes or covers. The playlist for the game's soundtrack can be found below, or in the discord.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/></p>\n<p>No matter how much of my rambling you read, I thank you for checking this game out. If you chose to download and play it, I hope it is able to entertain you in some way! I'm sure this game will change a lot in the coming months, so if you chose to embark with me on this journey, I welcome you to\u00a0Dialectic Pursuit!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Links:<br/></strong>Soundtrack<br/>Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e552649df3508d79700199fef72cc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EnderMon"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
