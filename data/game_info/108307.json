In the midst of all this chaos, can you stop the evil villain's plans before new year?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis adventure game was written for a contest that let me pick from a dozen different settings, so I decided to pick all of them, wrapped up in an innovative interface. The game got second place, too. If you enjoy puzzle solving with not much emphasis on plot and with general zaniness, this is the game for you!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aaf81057cae74425f4b4e5219bd3120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
