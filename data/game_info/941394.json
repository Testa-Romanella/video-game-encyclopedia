This follows the standard American ruleset, also called\u00a0English draughts. Captures are mandatory.</p>\n<p>This is my first project developed in Godot 4. I made it in just over a week.</p>\n<p>The game features human-vs-human, human-vs-bot, and bot-vs-bot game modes. There is no online play. The bot picks legal moves at random, so it's not very strong.</p>\n<p>You can customize the color of each player's pieces, and you can enable an \"autoplay\" mode that will play for you if you only have one legal move available.</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong>\u00a0</p><ul><li>On the web player, the game may freeze for a couple seconds when you click on your very first move. It's taking time to spin up the particle effects system.</li><li>Downloading the game might fail. I've been researching this and I believe it's because the \"SharedArrayBuffer\" feature on itch (required for Godot 4's web player) causes the browser to distrust itch's content delivery network, which serves game downloads.\u00a0See\u00a0https://itch.io/t/2025776/experimental-sharedarraybuffer-support\u00a0for an explanation of SharedArayBuffer.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c53/c53d0a5ed4b5b8a77ac1b0c7355da4b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Aezart"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
