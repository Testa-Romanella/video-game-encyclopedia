Get your mouse and headset ready, this game will test your rhythm and aim \u2013 pull off sick flicks to the beat and track to the bass!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game, the player is tasked with shooting objects that appear in carefully designed 3D spaces, to the beat of especially produced music. Imagine a rhythm game but with the entire map as the note highway. It will challenge the player\u2019s sense of rhythm, as well as their skill in first-person perspective aiming. They will have to flick: quickly move the crosshair to the target and click, and track: keep the crosshair on a moving target \u2013 all in time with the music!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt its core, BEAT AIMER! is a skill-based game. It builds upon two great traditions of rhythm games and first-person shooters, both of which encourage mastery through play. It is our intention to inherit this spirit; this game will reward players for their precision, both rhythmically and mechanically.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is not to say that our community will be exclusive to high-skilled players. After all, we want our game to be fun for everyone! In fact, it is our wish to build a community not only of players of all levels but also of creators. We plan to implement a beat-map editor and uploader, so that people can share their creations. In this sense, this game belongs not to us, but to the community.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T04:49:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56f/56f8eb8674d1ac367249d9ad3280c575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sigcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Signal compose"], "esrb_rating": null}
