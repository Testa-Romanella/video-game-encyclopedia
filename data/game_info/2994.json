The Quest - Hero of Lukomorye, Part II: Tainted Blood is an expansion to The Quest, a beautifully hand-drawn, immersive and enchanting world full of exciting challenges. After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don&amp;#39;t have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Lukomorye is still not free, Hero, so you must face new monsters and foes in order to help your friends, the Tzar and the rest of the royal family.  You will encounter exotic scenarios, including steppes, mountains, the Yishkatoli Greenhouse, the Temple of Hideous Phantoms, an underwater abyss and have the opportunity to become a member with Sir Martelius of the Order of the Sword, if you qualify. You may go mad in Argimon&amp;#39;s Mad Dwarves&amp;#39; Castle. Agent Kolobok will be at your side from the beginning.<br/><br/>- New monsters (monster levels 25-65)<br/>- 44 new quests<br/>- Highly sophisticated dungeons<br/>- 7 new spells<br/>- New, possibly fatal illness<br/>- New high level items<br/>- Agent Kolobok is back<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select &amp;quot;Luko Tainted Blood&amp;quot; as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 32 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion. Please note that after you have traveled to your destination, you&amp;#39;ll have no way back for a while (except if you have Marked a spot), so it is also recommended that you keep a save in Mithria.<br/><br/>The Quest - Hero of Lukomorye II has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.
