Plus, you have a major sweet tooth.\u00a0 So, you'll always have a donut on hand to defend yourself. Just be careful not to be unwise with how you use them. Just because they're unlimited, doesn't mean your launcher may not freeze up on you.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some monsters will kill you if you don't kill them first (even if they don't touch you). Remember to kill the creatures you see, when you see them or run for your life.\r\n</p>\n<p>Also, be aware of inanimate objects that are there to hurt you, bibles and stuff from the sex shop.\r\n</p>\n<p>9 Hellacious Levels including:\r\n</p>\n<p>- Weinie Town\r\n</p>\n<p>- Horror Forest\r\n</p>\n<p>- High School Cave\r\n</p>\n<p>- Weed World\r\n</p>\n<p>- Porn Heights\r\n</p>\n<p>- Metal Castle\r\n</p>\n<p>- Taco Hell\r\n</p>\n<p>- Church\r\n</p>\n<p>- Heaven\r\n</p>\n<p>In all of this madness, you have a saving grace... weed! Delicious, life enhancing mary jane.\u00a0 For every 10 nugs you collect, you'll get an extra life (max of 8 lives).\u00a0 Don't freak out if one of those sticky-icky weed nuggets doesn't disappear. You (should) still get the point and there's plenty ahead on your path. So, no worries.\r\n</p>\n<p>Buttons:\r\n</p>\n<p>A- Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>B- Shoot (keep trying if at first the donut glaze jams your launcher)\r\n</p>\n<p>Directional\r\n</p>\n<p>Left/Right: Walk left and right\r\n</p>\n<p>Up/Down: Climb ladders,trees, and other stuff\r\n</p>\n<p>WARNING: This game may not be suitable for your kids. Play it for yourself first. Maybe if they just play it and don't pay attention to anything they see, you'll be fine.\u00a0 I just don't want to be blamed if you end up having to have a weird conversation with your youngin' that you're too big of a chump to have.\u00a0 Think Leisure Suit Larry goes to Castlevania.\u00a0 But hey, if you keep them away from weird shit like this, maybe they'll grow up to make an even weirder game.\u00a0 That's what happened to me.\u00a0 Have fun champ.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:47:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a38/a38dbe1f105234dc95be6a3079cd7631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PartyBrains"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
