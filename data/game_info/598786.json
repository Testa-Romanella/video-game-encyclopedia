This is a free prototype, designed only to present the potential of a full game based on collecting and customizing teams of Hacks in order to beat specific challenges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This prototype was designed to test whether the mechanics are any fun. It is given here for free in order to try and collect sufficient positive feedback and users to make it worth a larger scale development and investment. If you enjoy or see the potential of this game, please leave a positive feedback.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note that this prototype was made by an amateur programmer with no formal education in the field. Many features might thus not be at the expected level or have some unfortunate bug. I apologize for such failures in advance.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer:</strong>\u00a0Download the game for internet multiplayer (direct connection). An open router path needs to be manually set by the host to enable this. May fail on some suppliers (if you're under CNAT).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T09:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a14772b0a3a2396b5d6e7671216335bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Krobnom"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
