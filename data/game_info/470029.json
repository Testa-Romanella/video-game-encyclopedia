The theme was \"Out of control\" so as you play the level changes in a way that you cannot control. The game was made by one person and all art was made in the jam. The music was downloaded by FStudios but altered by me. Sound effects were also made using SFXR and also downloaded from freeSound.org. It was unable to be uploaded to the actual jam due to an odd Web GL build error causing the game not to load in itch.io.</p>\n<p>Control</p>\n<p>A-D to move</p>\n<p>Left Click - F to dash</p>\n<p>Space - jump and double jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:52:17", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xd SilentStorm"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
