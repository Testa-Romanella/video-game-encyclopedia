I got started on game developing a couple of months ago, and I'm really liking it!

For now, there's like a third of the final planned content, many corrections have been done since the early version, but I'd love to get feedback if you find any errors (bugs, glitches, game design flaws, etc.).</p>\n<p>There will be a vlog on a YouTube channel pretty soon, so I'll post the link here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T14:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b786964304caadf39d87df04603113a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["KayCat"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
