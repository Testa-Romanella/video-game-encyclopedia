You'll quickly realise that they disappeared. You go to their house, but they aren't there.</p>\n<p>You go to the mountain house, the Mountain Dude tells you that Hero got kidnapped by a bad guy and Princess tried to save him. They are both inside the mountain.</p>\n<p>You go to the mountain, the bad guy is a snake and he tells you that you can only save one. You press one of the buttons to save one, you die.</p>\n<p><strong>End </strong>(not really).</p>\n<p>In the newspaper message at the end of the game you learn that an interdimensionnal breach has been  discovered, and they talk about it a bit more in the newspapers.</p>\n<p>You read the 3 newspapers (by pressing \"E\" near the wardrobes at Dog, Hero and Princess's house) and you learn more about the breach.</p>\n<p>(There's also an easter egg if you press \"E\" near the island on the left of Dog's house)</p>\n<p>After reading the 3 newspaper, you can go to the stairs inside the house on the upper left side of the map.</p>\n<p>You end up in the same map, but in 3D.</p>\n<p>There is nothing to do here, except going to Patricia island to find a secret portal that just appeared.</p>\n<p>Going inside the portal, you end up on an island with some pirate ships.<br/>The story (not really told in the game) is that the first scientist who has gone inside the breach got stuck here and became a pirate to survive. And he's fighting against some other pirates and you're helping him by collecting some random stuff to fight.</p>\n<p>Collect all of the stuff to fight.</p>\n<p>You helped the scientist against the pirates, you're both going back in the 2D world and the scientist fight against the bad snake. Hero and Princess are saved.</p>\n<p>I improvised most of the story the last day of the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68f/68fcbf3754615e9efc09be68ce315169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Roucasse"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
