I intend to continue working on this project, especially to implement the features I wanted to make in time for the jam but did not have time for. My intention for this project was to create a sort of \"dance\" in gameplay, alternating between melee and shooting.\u00a0It's a little barely functioning right now, but it works<em> almost</em>\u00a0as intended. If you do enjoy this version, please let me know and I'll release updates on the game as I make it, otherwise I'll just post it here on Itch when I'm happy with it. The first changes I'll make are:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Enemy bullet-firing will happen after a clear windup time punctuated by a red line on the floor, instead of happening instantly. Additionally, you were supposed to have limited ammo before needing to reload, and bullet deflection was supposed to home-in to a degree\u00a0on the enemy who fired it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:32:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcda5650593111bfbe9724f8b3ef6dad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver Bunny Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
