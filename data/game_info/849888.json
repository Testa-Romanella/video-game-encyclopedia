I didn't have enough time to fully finish it, so it is a quick game that doesn't have a main menu or anything like that. When you finish the game there is the quit button so you will have to shut down the game. I hope yall have fun with it, its not the best but its still goofy its not scary but if i was able to get more time it would be. Have fun and please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T07:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e9deaf0d0547ae8c335841d56f9891.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bunger1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
