And you are flying through this tunnel thing, but you also have a limited power supply. So you have to catch these crystal things like in Sonic and it gives you power. They respawn the crystals and the\u00a0goal is, like, to last as long as possible.</p>\n<p>And the controls are kinda slippery, like there's a little friction somehow even though it's in space (?) but there isn't much. WASD is forward/backward and side strafe, QE is down and up, and the arrow keys are like rotation. You can also press escape to go to the main menu but they didn't do it right so if you hold it down you load the level then instantly quit in a loop which is kinda funny</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d5befb0d0638973ddb00b2bddb81016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["crass_sandwich"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
