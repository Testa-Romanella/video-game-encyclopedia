{"id": 975678, "slug": "shard-shuffle", "name": "Shard Shuffle", "name_original": "Shard Shuffle", "description": "Shard Shuffle plunges you into a world that combines strategic skill and puzzle-solving. The goal is clear: strategically place pieces with various properties on the game board to destroy other elements and score points. Each piece has a certain number of life points and a distinct attack type. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game reaches its conclusion when the board can no longer accommodate new pieces. This is why methodical planning of your strategy is crucial to optimally eliminate pieces. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, piece destruction is only part of the equation to boost your high score. A combo system awards you additional points when you eliminate multiple pieces in one go. This allows you to obtain a highly explosive bomb, ideal for clearing a part of the board cluttered with pieces. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also features a challenge system, adding a dose of excitement by presenting random challenges to earn more points and Shards. Once collected, these Shards unlock customization elements to enrich the gaming experience according to your preferences.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T07:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c97b2aa12cb506a3a3a2dae782cd7a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Husk"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Husk"], "esrb_rating": null}
