The player takes on the role of BeeBee, a giant bee fighting to protect its hive. The game features power-ups to aid the player in combat as well as difficulty that ramps up over time.</p>\n\n<p>BeeBee was made in the Unity engine as a part of a team. Similar to a game jam, each team had 5 days to create a game based around\u00a0the theme 'Extinction'. Due to the time sensitive nature of the project, our team decided to make a 2D game as we felt we would be able to do more with the project.</p>\n\n<p>The game is score-driven, encouraging the player to keep playing to beat their previous score. As the game progresses the quantity and types of enemies change to increase difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc32f22623e590ab8c71112325ba2d71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abi Sanders"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
