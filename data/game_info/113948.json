Some research was undertaken as a preliminary investigation, whereby 54 students took part in a series of 4 tests to assess factors in memory recall. The results of this research fed into the planning, design and development of a piece of software that teaches students Japanese vocabulary. </p><p>The main investigation aimed to measure the effectiveness of the Working Model of Memory in the language software. 43 students were split into three independent groups and tested over 3 days to recall 30 Japanese Romaji. One condition had software with a quiz and flashcards (Multi-Store Model software). One condition had a soundboard and Method of Loci (Working Model of Memory software). The final test group had a paper control. </p><p>The students had 25 minutes with the allotted pedagogy method and then asked to write all the Romaji they could remember. The same quiz was given to the students two days later. </p><p>The results showed that the implementation of the Working Model of Memory increased the amount of words recalled by 145%, compared to a paper control. There was also an 83% increase in partial and correct answers compared to software that did not cater to the Working Model of Memory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67e/67e083e71655a01cdbe42a966a47895c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["James Brankin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
