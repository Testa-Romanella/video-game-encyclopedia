Players choose which Starbot food delivery robot they will take into battle and which part of George Mason\u2019s campus their food fight will take place. In the traditional levels, players must fight each other using food-themed attacks. Each of the four locations has a unique gameplay mechanic that causes mayhem for the players. In Frenzy Mode, players work together to prevent the evil robots from invading their base. Or, a player can take on Frenzy Mode alone and see how long they can last.</p>\n<p>Starbot Showdown features cartoonish, maze-like levels inspired by George Mason University\u2019s campus.
