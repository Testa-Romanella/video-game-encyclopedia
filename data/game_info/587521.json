Eventually the project moved on and it lives on in my current game <strong>Project\u00a0</strong><strong>Robo Lair</strong> (working title) at the time of writing. Gameplay wise 2600\u00a0is inspired by Robotron, even the look of the game is a bit too close to the Robotron aesthetic. The aim on each level is to access the warp gate, but to get there you'll have to defeat enemies, get keys to unlock gates and so on. There is around 21 levels, once you complete the last level you'll be beamed back to the main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Z, Space Bar or Left Shift to Fire</li><li>Arrow Keys to Move</li><li>R to Reset the Level</li></ul>\n<p><em>You can also access a test area but I'll keep it a secret :)\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T09:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7cb9b2b4f8dda2eb49c48b4b28554c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dungeon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
