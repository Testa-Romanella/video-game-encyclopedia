So we simply googled the qualities of a \"Down to Earth\" man and one of the key qualities of him was to \"listen\". A down to earth human pays attention to what one has to say. He is humble, respecting and with a peaceful mind. So with that kept in our minds, we designed a game where you have to listen carefully to the sounds in the game and move along that way to keep moving forward.\r\n</p>\n<p>1.
