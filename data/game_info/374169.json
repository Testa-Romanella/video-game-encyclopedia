The game played pretty better at around 5:05 AM but we managed to break most of it by the deadline :)</p>\n<p>The game explores the concept of change and its effect on your environment. The player is given access to a small island where random dudes come to party. But some are not happy and want to fight. Happy people affect others by spreading happiness while angry people spread misery. The player can manage the average happiness of the dudes on the island by separating them and managing their \u00a0social groups.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway - enjoy the dances and some punches :)</p>\n\n<p>Credits: Krum Petrov and Nikola Georgiev</p><p>Song we used: DOLCE VITA by RYAN PARIS<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe3/fe32e055f3e2acbf8fed07c8edde68f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kvabakoma"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
