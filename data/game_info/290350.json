You can play against bots or play against your friends in split-screen multiplayer mode.\u00a0 Get your brick up to speed (when you see a particle trail behind it) and SMASH into the other players to deal damage.\u00a0 Whoever is the last brick standing wins!\u00a0 I\u00a0made this with the intention of creating 1 game per month this year (2019). Be sure to check back every month for a new release.\u00a0I hope you enjoy the game and thanks for your interest in my work!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:19:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7f18faee371b78f8c1abbcb8b49c8ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alvinkpollard"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
