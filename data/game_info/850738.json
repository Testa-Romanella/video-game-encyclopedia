As you kill your opponents, you will gain any superpowers they had already gained.<br/><br/>Feel the freedom of going anywhere in the city with web-slinging and flight.<br/><br/>As the game is also VR enabled, it might make it easier to transfer the superpowers to your dreams at night, if you are anything like me.<br/><br/>Play either against bots on your own computer, or against real people via LAN or the internet.<br/><br/>As well as Battle Royale mode, there is also a Deathmatch mode where you attempt to get more kills than anyone else in a 10 minute match.<br/><br/>Host your own dedicated server, or use peer-to-peer from your own PC.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T06:56:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90bc8e763e3fef7918b4836f5dc686ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Hendry Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robert Hendry Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
