You've been sent to this Solar System to harvest some resources as one of your a daily tasks. Apparently, the Ancient Dynasty needs more resources to build a new Galaxy Super Cluster, you've been told that dreams work super well as a celestial fuel when mixed with some elements you can get from the smoldering surface of the sun.</p>\n<p><strong>#**WARNINGS and notes!**</strong></p>\n<p>The game has a few quirky things going on that I won't be able to solve before the end of the jam as I'll be away from my computer for some time:</p>\n<p><strong>**Progression:**</strong></p>\n<p>- The instructions were unfortunately not implemented ingame on time, so here is a quick explanation of how it works:</p>\n<p>The amount of resources to reach each milestone is shown in the right panel. Once you have enough resources and unlock the next part of the Dyson Sphere, the objective will update automatically.</p>\n<p>&gt; Get Dreams to unlock the Railgun\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; Press \"R\" and shoot meteors to get Iron and Ubaru to eventually have enough to build the Dyson Sphere Foundation</p>\n<p>&gt; The Foundation will collect Milithium for you, so get more dreams, iron and ubaru until you have enought to build the Dyson Sphere Energy Poles</p>\n<p>&gt; The Poles will get Gramanthium for you, so go back to dreams and meteors until you get the Dyson Sphere Disks.</p>\n<p>***The Sun is where you gets Milithium and Gramanthium, however these are harvested automatically by the Dyson Sphere Foundation and Dyson Sphere Energy Poles respectively, so just shoot meteors (gives Iron and Ubaru) and collect dreams from the planet, the Dyson Sphere parts will do the dirty job in the Sun for you.**</p>\n<p>* Shooting meteors can be a bit frustrating, I don't know what I did (possibly the perspective needs some tweeks) but sometimes it looks like you are hitting the meteor, but in fact, you aren't lol. I noticed that rotating the camera around can give better angles and the shots will hit eventually, if you're not being able to hit one specific annoying little comet, just look for another one that's closeby.</p>\n<p>* When you aim at the planet, sun or the moon, the Railgun get's disabled. A voice line was supposed to be played when you did this mocking you for trying commit mass extinction... Unfortunately I wasn't able to record the voice line and implement it, so instead of a bit funny, it's a bit annoying lol.. Just hit R again and you should be fine.</p>\n<p>* There is an obvious lack of feedback in the game, there are no sounds apart from the music and almost no effects when you actually perform something so I've opted out of the \"Audio\" category.</p>\n<p>* The humor aspect was going to come from the voice lines, too bad lol, opted out too.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing, I hoped to give you a much better experience, unfortunately but welp, the feature cutting is real lol.</p>\n<p>LudumDare 52 was great!</p>\n\n<p>Music Credits:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Magical Journey Through Space by Leonell Cassio | https://soundcloud.com/leonellcassio</strong></p>\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</p>\n</strong>\n\n<p><strong>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T05:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f1460878c2490a0280401b11e53e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Southrad"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
