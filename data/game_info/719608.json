While fulfilling various orders you need not only to understand what kind of ghost you are dealing with, but also to carry out an exorcism ritual so that the ghost can no longer harm someone. But beware, hasty conclusions can lead you to a sad outcome. You can play this game alone or with friends, where everyone will have their own role: someone searches the premises in search of additional evidence, someone installs equipment in order to start collecting evidence, and someone can sit in a tent and observe the indicators on monitors. All of these aspects are important in order to determine the type of ghost and then prepare the correct elements to exorcise it.<br/><br/>At the moment in this game are available 10 proofs and more than 20 types of ghosts, so it will not be easy to determine which ghost is in front of you. But don't be discouraged: you will have more than 20 items at your disposal to help you cope with the ghost. Determine the type of ghost using the evidence collected by the devices, begin preparing for the ritual of exorcism, and then perform the ritual. By expelling the ghost and completing additional tasks, you will be able to fully complete the order and receive a reward. As you gain experience, you will be able to receive more complex orders and buy the latest equipment.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Play with your friends!</strong><br/>You can call your friends or find new ones among the list in lobbies and expel as many ghosts as possible with them!<br/><br/><strong>Speech recognition!</strong><br/>With a microphone\u2019s help, you can make a connection with the other world: ghosts can respond or show by their actions that they do not want to see you.<br/><br/><br/><strong>The equipment is all ours!</strong><br/>Use the coolest tools to collect evidence: from an EMF sensor, to a voice recorder, a dual-mode motion sensor, a laser projector, and more.<br/><br/><strong>Various tasks!</strong><br/>In the game in addition to the two main tasks you can find many additional ones.
