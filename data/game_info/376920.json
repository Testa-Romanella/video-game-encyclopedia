Ashes of Creation Apocalypse is the standalone prequel to the upcoming epic MMORPG Ashes of Creation. It is both a testing ground for new systems and content in Ashes of Creation, as well as a unique last-man-standing action game where magic, steel, and chaos reign supreme. Ashes of Creation Apocalypse is a high fantasy, free-to-play experience where no two battles are ever the same.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse, the world of Verra is on the brink of destruction - the only way out is to be the last one standing. It is an arena-based game which will support a number of different game modes, including battle royale-style gameplay, castle sieges, and gigantic monster horde battles! Our high fantasy setting, the vast array of gear and spells, and our massively destructible environments make for an experience unlike anything you\u2019ve played. Hop in, stay alive, and win the glory.<br/><br/>Will you wield a tome that can summon meteors? A deadly two-handed halberd that can steal the life from your foes? Will you play it safe and hide away in a tower, hoping it won't collapse beneath you? Anything can happen in the dying world of Verra.<br/><br/>Play alone or with your friends, level up your character, and win prestige in a high fantasy world rife with magic, medieval weaponry, and incredible graphical fidelity.
