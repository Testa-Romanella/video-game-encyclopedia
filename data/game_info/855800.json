If you touch a wall or any moving object you will lose life. Your goal is to get the white runes to escape from this dark labyrinth.</p><p>It is very possible that you will not be able to see very well in the game due to its great darkness, but that will be fixed in the next update.</p><p>[Gamepad and controller support]</p><p>[Better itchio page ]<br/></p>\n<p>[Download available coming soon]</p>\n<p>[Android port ? ]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T16:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c8/2c866b2985dd691c154181830b231660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adryh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
