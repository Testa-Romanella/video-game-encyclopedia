In a short limit of time, Player has to control protagonist to jump between his 2 mini planets and remove invasive plants with his shovel. You can also dig up some carrot and cook it in a volcano\u00a0 if you need to refill health. <br/><br/>In the novel, it's mentioned that baobab trees are a dangerous menace. Without carefully monitoring, their roots may destroy a small planet. We feel this mechanic is very funny so we decided to make a game for it. But for gameplay reason, we change the baobab trees to vine.</p>\n<p><strong>Control</strong><br/>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Move Camera<br/>Space - Jump<br/>E - Interact<br/>Left Click - Dig/Attack<br/>Right Click - Reset Camera</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Use</strong><br/>Esc - instant quit<br/>T - instant spawn falling seed<br/>Y - instant reduce 1 hp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T00:33:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3eb5dda09825953d76ec71b196d4242d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SunnyChowTheGuy"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
