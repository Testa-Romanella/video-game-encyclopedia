This is my third 'published' game and is incredibly fleshed out compared to the last two. Screenshots and video are not up yet but they will be sometime soon!</p>\n<p>This game is a 1-4 player twin stick shooter. It features random level generation, dynamically increasing AI, 4 player drop in and out, random weather, time of day, random shops, and more! It's very early in development so be weary of bugs, but I think it's coming along nicely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: (Controller only at the moment)</p>\n<p>Select -&gt; Join Game</p>\n<p>Left Stick -&gt; Move</p>\n<p>Right Stick -&gt; Aim</p>\n<p>Left Bumper -&gt; Interact (use)</p>\n<p>Right Bumper/Trigger -&gt; Shoot</p>\n<p>Right Stick Click -&gt; Flashlight</p>\n<p>A(X) -&gt; Jump</p>\n<p>B(O) -&gt; Switch Weapons</p>\n<p>Y(Triangle) -&gt; Drop / Pickup weapon</p>\n<p>X(Square) -&gt; Reload</p>\n<p>Start -&gt; Disable fps counter</p>\n<p>Again this is very early in the project so expect things not to work perfectly. The progression is quite difficult with only one player but you get a lot more cash so it evens out. I plan to add different types of zombies, more level pieces, and more guns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you did download this please take the time to give me the slightest of feedback, any little bit counts~</p>\n<p>FyxeINC@Gmail.com</p>\n\n<p>ALSO BECAUSE ITS A PROTOTYPE I don't have UI for a lot of things so here's what you need to know if you play it.</p>\n<p>- There is a revive mechanic, when your teammate dies press the interact button ten times while close to them. (you will get $100)</p>\n<p>- When all the players die you have to restart the game, I haven't put in end conditions yet :)</p>\n<p>- Don't fall off the map, nuff said.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b7a35b73a816b9c842516bbd5abecbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fyxe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
