{"id": 812250, "slug": "love-and-enchants", "name": "Love and Enchants", "name_original": "Love and Enchants", "description": "Your grandpa always told you two things: \"Boy, if you wanna be rich, you gotta learn enchanting. Everyone loves enchanted stuff.\" and \"Boy, if you wanna get girls, you gotta get money\". While those words didn't mean much to you growing up, with puberty hitting, you suddenly developed a keen interest in the qualities of being rich.<br/><br/>So, you set out and studied enchanting. After years of ardours, studious, boringous [yes, this grammatical error is intentional xD] education, you finally grasped the enchanting 101 and, in a wave of enthusiasm bought yourself a small magic store out in the sticks. You have your eyes keenly set on earning money, buying weapons with it, enchanting them, getting better, earning more money and repeating ad infinitum or ad sexum. Likely the latter. Now, how to find girls?<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>-Become a master enchanter and forge weapons that will shake the very ground!<br/>-Your skills will get better by ingame upgrades and by you, as the player, learning how to better ocmbine things!<br/>-A never seen before enchanting mechanic, taking inspiration from the cartograph and scrabble!<br/>-Meet a cute raccon girl, a demon that hates dealing with customers and (maybe) find the harem ending!<br/>-Enchant weapons with subsets of the elements, in endless combinations!<br/>-Sell those weapons to a plethora of zany classes<br/>-Travel to far away places, to learn more, specialized elements like poison or magnetism (and maybe peek on girls in an onsen...)!<br/><br/><strong>The Girls:</strong><br/><strong>-Tayla:</strong> A cute racoonish tomboy girl, who will handle delivery and procuring of your stock. She is energetic and adventurous (in all the way you'd want a girl to be adventurous), but might actually have a pure soul.<br/><strong>-Zell: </strong> The demon girl who hates customer, but gets hired as a storeclerk since she is kinda cute. She would love to be serious, but tends to mess up and is a bit of clutz at times. <br/><br/>All characters are over the age of 18", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T06:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa076656f581506cacb689e7d6ed1e09.jpg", "website": "http://shadycorner.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 329, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schneeritter Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shady Corner Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
