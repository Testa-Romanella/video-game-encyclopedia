Players earn points for every single time the ball comes into contact with a paddle. Players have to \u201ckeep their marbles\u201d while juggling these two objects between the planks. There\u2019s no timer to restrict the player, the player instead has a set number of lives- when a ball falls off the bottom of the screen or the sides of the screen, the player loses a single life. When the player runs out of the lives, the game is over. When the game ends, the game completely stops- the paddles can still be moved, but the balls stop moving, and your score is displayed on the screen. The balls are out of reach from the paddles after the game ends. The goal is simple, to get the highest possible score without losing, and to prevent yourself from losing lives as many times as possible.</p>\n<strong><em>Game Created by: Matt Danielson\u00a0and Wilson Russell</em></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T04:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/32206b23f5fd6add547d1866ea5168a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Matt Danielson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
