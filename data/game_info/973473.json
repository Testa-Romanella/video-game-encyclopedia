Easiest post there is, just a few nights and you're off the hook. Only the outpost, a small shrine and the rest of the forest can be seen...<br/><br/>What did you say? Strange shadows? Weird sounds? Paranormal activities? Those are just legends, bedtime stories man! There's no way there is stuff like that out there!\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Abtos Covert</strong> is a survival horror game in which you play the role of a soldier keeping guard on a remote outpost out in the woods. You must keep your wits while searching for the truth. Fend off the mysterious entities attacking the outpost and find clues from previous soldiers who had the same shift and survived every night. Things will only get harder as you progress, so stay vigilant. Can you survive every night and discover the truth behind the stories, or will you become part of the legend?<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Deep forest setting: your hauntingly realistic battlefield.<br/></li><li> Unique equipment: alarms, spotlights, lockers for hide-and-seek.<br/></li><li> Eerie soundscapes: listen to tell where the danger lurks.<br/></li><li> Varied threats: each enemy has a unique pattern. Adapt or perish.<br/></li><li> Clues and backstory: piece together messages from guards gone by.<br/></li><li> Nightly escalation: each shift is more terrifying than the last.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Well soldier, seems like you're that guy. You drew the short straw and now you are to be stationed in the Abtos Covert outpost, a place commonly known for being quiet. But the moment it actually happens, the rest of the platoon is whispering: \"Haven't you heard the stories?\", \"...heard someone disappeared there...\". <br/><br/>The stories about that place are innumerable. Human sacrifices, shadows running in the trees and souls still lost that sing a dreary song. When you ask your superior, he just laughs it off...<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Abtos Covert, the gameplay is an immersive blend of psychological tension and strategic survival. Your primary objective: survive the night. You are equipped with just cameras and motion sensors to alert you to the horrors that stalk the night. Make quick decisions: use your spotlight to reveal threats or hide and pray you're overlooked. Listen for distinctive enemy sounds; each one requires a different survival strategy. With limited power, every choice you make could plunge you into lethal darkness. Each night grows more terrifying, forcing you to adapt, strategize, and confront the haunting truth that looms in the shadows. Will you survive, or become the next cautionary tale?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T04:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfddd71fdd67095e6cd4c85c37b43594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iphigames", "Team Abtos"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Iphigames"], "esrb_rating": null}
