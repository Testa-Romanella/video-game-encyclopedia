So he decided to leave it to create a new one,<br/>with real intelligent lifeforms (he always was exited about mushrooms).<br/>And with him, some rules of physics left the universe too.</p>\n<p>So the earth didn't move any longer. To prevent the people from panic,<br/>you have to move the world around the sun and this in 365 days each<br/>circle. If you are too fast, the human could become sceptic. If you<br/>are too slow it will also happen.</p>\n<p>And don't come too close too the sun... and don't come too far. <br/>Ah yeah, some planets exploded in the galaxy too. Don't collide with<br/>the asteroids.</p>\n<p>Good luck</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5ee58e8105c09067e97c8e8e10b7a95c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["xtristrix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
