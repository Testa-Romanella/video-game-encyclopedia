Each tile has connections to other tiles, that give the player either more or less points depending on what tiles are around that tile. When you have enough points, you can buy new islands to build on. <br/><br/><br/><br/>After buying an island you will be presented with two quests, one of which you can choose. These quests are given to you as cards and are placed as any other tile. By completing quests you can get points and unlock new cards into your rotation. Those are the basics, although there are a lot more things you will have to discover yourself!<br/><br/><h3>What the game offers</h3><ul><li>A relaxing atmosphere (until you stumble upon a disaster that is)<br/></li><li>A lot of different handcrafted islands<br/></li><li>Many unlockable cards with different effects and tiles<br/></li><li>Quests<br/></li><li>Rare events<br/></li><li>Disasters<br/></li><li>Infinite gameplay (until you lose of course)</li></ul><h3>The game does not feature</h3><ul><li>Resource &amp; Population management<br/></li><li>Technology tree<br/></li><li>And other major city building mechanics</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T08:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b61/b617ca49611d9cd8aa34a977a649c526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lifty Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lifty Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
