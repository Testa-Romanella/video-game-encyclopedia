We currently consist of a programmer, sound-designer, musician and game director (who also does most other things - design, writing, graphics etc.). We do not yet earn money making games, but hope that people enjoy what we do enough to eventually get some kind of funding! Making games and giving people the chance to live out digital adventures is our passion, and we hope our project catches your attention. We're giving this our all within our given limitations and are aiming to finish the game within a year or two (assuming things go as planned)!</p>\n<p>We will continue to update this page at certain points in development, when we have enough new content to warrant it.\u00a0 Your feedback means the world to us - please do leave some! Thank you for checking out our project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c5/0c592b55cb950530e398e00521dea575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Game Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
