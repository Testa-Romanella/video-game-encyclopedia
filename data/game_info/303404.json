The objective is that the player\u00a0has to mash the keyboard to find the right key to spam to make the monster(/hallucination) go away until the player manages to wake up.<br/></p>\n<p>The mechanics represent my experience with sleep paralysis, and doesn't necessarily reflect how others experience it.\u00a0 A common \"solution\" to \"get out\" of sleep paralysis is to concentrate on moving a small body part, like a finger or a toe, and that will pull you right out. While I was making this, I attempted to emulate the mixture of panic and concentration while trying to \"wake up\" from sleep paralysis, via the search-and-spam nature of the keyboard mechanic.</p>\n<p>I decided to upload the prototype by itself, because I don't know when I'm going to continue this idea. That and the code in the project is so old and so tied to old files that don't exist anymore, that it isn't easy to make any updates. Yet, this is still a game I wanted to share on a public forum.\u00a0I still plan on making an actual game out of this in the future.</p>\n<p>Any feedback I take from this game will go into the creation of the new, updated and refactored version\u00a0of this game, whenever that will be. So feedback and bug reports are highly encouraged.</p>\n<p>If you've read this far, thank you for your time!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>A through Z on the Keyboard - Mash keys to boost the bar by a little.<br/>??? Key in A through Z - Spam it repeatedly to boost the bar by a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Mash the key on your keyboard\u00a0to keep your concentration bar out of the red until time runs out. The key you need to mash\u00a0will change every 5 seconds. If the monster doesn't get you before time runs out, you win!</p>\n<p>If the tutorial is still confusing, I made a small video demonstrating gameplay:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58d28b5eeca4ec1d7eccfba800212d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konahri-Arty"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
