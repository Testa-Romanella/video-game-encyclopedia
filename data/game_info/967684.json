Oppression and injustice pervade this dark realm under Death's absolute control. At the bottom of the social hierarchy are the Penitents: unfortunate souls indebted to Death, twisted by his magic into uncanny animal-human hybrids. Above them are the Elect: those in Death's favor, who enjoy an existence of freedom, entitlement, and luxury.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the Afterlife is beginning to fall into an even greater and more mysterious corruption. Performers have gone missing from the luxurious entertainment center; a sanctuary for both Penitents and the Elect is under attack; and a mysterious sickness has started spreading throughout the land.<br/><br/>This presents you with an even more perilous threat\u2014but also an opportunity.
