After the Robot Uprising and the Petpocalypse, stray humans are often found running about\u00a0with nobody to look after them.</p>\n<p>You are Dr. Dog, a border collie with\u00a0a great pedigree and a medical pet-degree.\u00a0You have just opened your own Human Society, the first no-kill shelter for humans. Choose, feed, and entertain your humans, keep them healthy, and maybe even find them\u00a0their forever homes!</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>What we got done:</strong> Right now you can just walk around the shelter a little bit, and none of the simulation bits really work. There are a few cool things to look at though! Some of the humans are also randomly generated, so try reloading a couple times. The HUD in the upper right corner is just a preview of how some of the in-game UI might look, with your funds, population, happiness, health, and hunger stats.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>If we had more time:\u00a0</strong>The game would let you manage your shelter and who was admitted. You'd need to pay rent and upkeep, and make tradeoffs such as which food and entertainment to give to which humans. How much can you expand your shelter?\u00a0How many humans can you find forever homes for?
