Like its predecessors, it is based around building cities.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>Unlike the previous two installments of the series, which were set in the future, Anno 1800 returns to the series&#39; roots and is based on real history. The game is set in the 19th century and explores the first twenty years of Industrial Revolution era. The industrialization and rising capitalism greatly influence the gameplay. The game features units like trains and cannons and takes into account such factors as workers&#39; strikes and environmental pollution.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Anno series gameplay is a lot like if Civilization was in real time. In Anno 1800, the player controls an island country and administers its economy, military, diplomacy, and society. He or she discovers new technologies, explores the map, builds cities, factories, and farms, makes allies, and fights enemies. The game reintroduces randomly generated maps and physical trading goods that can be shipped by the routes. Unlike in the previous game, the combat is fully integrated into the gameplay and is not separated from the city building sessions. The game also features new elements such as tourism.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>There are three main modes in Anno 1800: a sandbox mode, a campaign with a plot, and a multiplayer mode.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T10:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/065/0650c381e12c28053e1c98779d996305.jpg", "website": "https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/anno-1800/", "rating": 4.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 256, "beaten": 70, "toplay": 163, "dropped": 79, "playing": 48}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 161, "suggestions_count": 615, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 162, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Byte"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
