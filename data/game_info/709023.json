Dr. Eliza Kamen, an expert in biotechnology, and genetic engineering, has broken all the rules, and illegally pursued human cloning technology.  After her unfortunate past, she decided to level the score, take over the world, and destroy all men in the process!<br/><br/>Dr. Kamen and her staff created 2 mind-alerting serums.  Serum A for women, and Serum B for men.  In which almost every person in the world has received against their will.  Dr. Kamen's cloning device allows her to take over the world with sheer numbers alone, and her serums virtually eliminate all resistance groups. <br/><br/>A note has recently been distributed, and addressed to anyone who is not brainwashed.  It reads as follows:  Dr. Kamen\u2019s laboratory, and her cloning device must be destroyed before it\u2019s too late.  If you are reading this, please do your part.  The mind-altering effects will be reversed when the main computer is destroyed, and everyone will go back to what they were before.  The world will slowly return to normal, and become peaceful again, as it once was.  Please try your best, we need everyone we have.<br/><br/>Good Luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T03:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e680ab6ae3caf736255fe87d0acc52ce.jpg", "website": "http://www.dirtyfightergame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zero Brain"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zero Brain"], "esrb_rating": null}
