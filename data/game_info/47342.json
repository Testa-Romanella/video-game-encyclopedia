{"id": 47342, "slug": "cats-make-you-smarter", "name": "Cats Make You Smarter!", "name_original": "Cats Make You Smarter!", "description": "Cats Make You Smarter! is a splendid memory puzzle game with cats and various twists.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to find and match all identical cats on the board. The tiles are flipped over so you can only see their backs.<br/><br/>Depending on the difficulty level you can flip 2, 3, 4 or 5 tiles at a time.<br/><br/>If the revealed cats are identical, the tiles are claimed and your score increases. Otherwise, the tiles are flipped back and you can continue flipping up other tiles.<br/><br/>When you claim all the tiles on a board, you may get bonus points if you have been quick enough and haven\u2019t made too many attempts while matching the tiles.<br/><br/>You will then move on to a larger board, so your memory is challenged even more!<br/><br/>Select flipped or claimed tiles to reveal a full screen image with the cat\u2019s name, their favorite quote and a special information (i.e. Patience, Monster or Psychedelic Mood status.)<br/><br/>Cats Make Your Smarter! offers 5 game modes which all share basic game concepts and also have their own special variations and twists.#1: Sleepy KittyOther than the time limit, you are free to flip the tiles as many times as you need, so this is the classic memory game you might be familiar with already.<br/><br/>This game mode is ideal for beginners, or when you are a bit tired.#2: Good Luck, Jerry!Here each cat has a number of Patience points. When the flipped tiles are not matched, each flipped tile loses a Patience point.<br/><br/>When a flipped tile has only 1 Patience point left, it gains a red border as a reminder for you to be cautious with it. Once a tile runs out of its Patience, it becomes a Trouble tile. A Trouble tile\u2019s background is all red. If you flip such a tile, and it\u2019s not a match, each of the flipped Trouble tiles will move randomly, pushing tiles around the board.<br/><br/>As the tiles move around it will be harder to remember each tile\u2019s position, so try not to annoy the cats \u2013 although annoyed cats give you better score!#3: Jones of NostromoIn this game mode the cats have less Patience points.<br/><br/>Moreover, one of the cats \u2013 the Monster \u2013 starts with 0 Patience points. And, if this weren\u2019t dangerous enough already, as a special rule, you can only match the Monster tiles last, after you have matched all others on the board.<br/><br/>A Monster tile behaves like a Trouble tile, so avoid them!#4: Nyan-Nyan NinjaThis game mode tests your reflexes as well as your ability to recognize patterns.<br/><br/>The tiles are laid out on the board without being flipped, but you only have a very limited time to select the identical tiles.<br/><br/>You get some extra time after each successful match, but if you accidentally select cats which aren\u2019t identical, your time gets halved immediately, so be very careful!#5: Mr. Bigglesworth Sends His RegardsThe cats are having a party and feeling a bit psychedelic, thus finding matches will be a lot harder in this happy chaos.<br/><br/>Each cat have 0 Patience points, so if you cannot match them, they will wander around just like as if they were Trouble tiles.<br/><br/>As cats are so impatient here but also very curious, each flipped tile\u2019s immediate neighbors will also be flipped \u2013 for free \u2013 which allows you to memorize up to 9 tiles for each flipped tile.<br/><br/>The cats also choose a randomly picked color for themselves each time you flip them, so don\u2019t be fooled by this trickery: try to ignore the colors and concentrate only on the cats!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f78/f782adc76684818991900f30d85fda49.jpg", "website": "https://sandorhq.com/games/cats-make-you-smarter", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 126, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SandorHQ"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["SandorHQ"], "esrb_rating": null}
