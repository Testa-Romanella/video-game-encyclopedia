Future releases will include trading, more control over stats and men, sea events, ship upgrades, rival ships, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> - mouse click or tap on sea or towns.</p>\n<p>Note: generating a new game map takes at least 5-10 seconds on a modern processor. Please be patient! There isn't a save feature and if the page is refreshed a previous map can't currently be restored. But anyway, this is a casual game... I don't think you will need such a feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Please leave feedback below</strong> if you'd like to see further development of this concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec4/ec470613664f77d75a7dce409aaa3b42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mn3monic"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
