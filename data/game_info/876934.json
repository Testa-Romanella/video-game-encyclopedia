Global warming melted the poles, and now most of the land is under water.</p>\n<p>In this new environment a familiar species thrived: the Octopus. These animals have gained sentience and are now the dominant species on Earth, while the remains of Humanity are treated as lower class citizens, good only for creating insulated electrical circuits.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the City of Poitiers, the diplomatic capital of Octopus and Human Collaboration in France, disaster struck. The power plant of Saint-Pierre Cathedral has gone silent and the whole city is at risk of running out of electricity. Octopus are blaming the incident on the Human population and a major diplomacy crisis is on our hands.\r\n</p>\n<p>To resolve this, the \u201cBrigade d\u2019Intervention Terrestre Et Sous-marine\u201d calls for two of their best agents, Hooman the Octopus and Octo the Human, to investigate the power plant. Will they be able to do it?\r\n</p>\n<p>To launch the game, go to build/bin/x64/Debug and launch the executable. Also, this game requires two external controllers.</p>Credits:<ul><li><strong>\u00a0Vincent 'Turnute' Tourenne : </strong>Concept,<strong>\u00a0</strong>Level Design, Musique</li><li><strong>Bastien 'Babachanteur' Doret : </strong>Concept,\u00a0Programmation, Lead Prog</li><li><strong>Vincent Pelletier :\u00a0</strong>Concept, Programmation</li><li><strong>Ma\u00eblle Demaret :\u00a0</strong>Concept, Assets Graphiques</li><li><strong>Zo\u00e9 Philippon : Concept,\u00a0</strong>Assets Graphiques, Lead Graphic Designer,\u00a0 Animations</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T10:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/504febfcf61648ce98234af51b31ceb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Turnute"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
