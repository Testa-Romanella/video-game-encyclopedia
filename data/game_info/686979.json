It was the year when millions of players assumed the role of rookie cop-turned-secret agent Leon S. Kennedy as he traveled to rural Spain in pursuit of Ashley Graham, the president's missing daughter. A watershed moment in gaming, Resident Evil 4 was a reinvention of both its series and its genre - not to mention one hell of a party.\r\n  </p>\n<p>More importantly, Leon had\u00a0<em>amazing\u00a0</em>hair. Oh, and he flipped over lasers. For many, he entered the hallowed halls of video game heartthrobs in the same way he crashed through two-story windows: suddenly and with swag.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>But we all know Leon's story. What about Ashley's? For the players of Resident Evil 4, she is, at best, an objective; at worst, a liability. A human cog in a well-oiled gameplay machine. But what if she was more than that? What if she was an interesting person, thrust into a crazy world with crazier men who run the gamut from hottie to hellspawn? How would she narrate this nightmare and who would she actually fall for?\r\n  </p>\n<p>Wonder no more. This is her story. This is\u00a0<em>RE4: Otome Edition.</em>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Relive the events of Resident Evil 4, faithfully recreated from Ashley's perspective - and with exactly as much absurdity as that entails!\r\n  </li><li>Kindle your relationship with a host of eligible bachelors, including the stoic Leon, the mysterious Luis, the evasive Merchant, or perhaps even the conniving Lord Saddler!*\r\n  </li><li>Discover what happened to Ashley in the scenes you never saw, such as her initial kidnapping, her imprisonment on a wall, Salazar's ritual, and more!</li><li>Make decisions that leave you questioning whether you're really in control!</li><li><strong>Full Game Length: 5-8 hours </strong>(based on reading speed, replays)</li><li><strong>Part I Release Date:</strong>\u00a0January 25, 2020</li><li><strong>Full Release Date: March 22, 2021</strong></li><li><strong>Latest Version:</strong> 1.04 (Released Halloween 2021)</li><li><strong>Gameplay Style:</strong>\u00a0Lightly Branching Visual Novel\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: RE4: Otome Edition is a parody and thus subject to Fair Use.
