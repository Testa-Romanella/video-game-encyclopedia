It packs a powerful punch, but unfortunately it's SO powerful it sends you hurtling backwards an alarming distance. Although this \"feature\" of your tank may seem to do nothing but increase your chances of crashing into an enemy or off an edge, perhaps it can be turned to your advantage...?</p><p>To control the tank use the mouse cursor to orientate yourself and aim, and WASD to move. Left mouse button fires. But be careful when you do so!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1e254e2e7aa601c9185f859c1f91f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["cgriff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
