Beta Version 0.2.0</p>\n<p>If you are prepared to downrate this project, just imagine being the developer that made the game in his teenage years, so don't underestimate the imagination of an ambitious 13 year old Game Developer.</p>\n<p>Errors to comply:</p>\n<p>Comment down below if you found any.</p>\n<p>Things the game doesn't make sense:</p>\n<p>No goals and no Achievements. Solution: In the Late Main\u00a0Releases.</p>\n<p>And a message of\u00a0concern:</p>\n<p>The game can only handle 20 clients and that's disturbing because you have roughly a billion people you know of\u00a0so the only way of increasing the value of clients is to donate around 50 - 150$ so I can upgrade the multiplayer cloud to handle more than 100 clients so if you want to play with a ton of friends, make sure to donate and support in anyway possible.
