You are not the Hero here, you play as a Sidekick.\r\n\n<p>The Hero and you are on an adventure but you will not be killing monsters or saving princesses. No, your job it to keep the Hero alive, pick up and provide him with power-ups, and generally say out of harms way.</p>\n<p>Be quick on your feet, pick up stuff that falls out from the enemies defeated by the Hero and don't let the Hero die by giving him with those items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PS: This is our group's first finished project. It's primary role was to allow us to learn how to work together well. Please look forward for our future, much more polished, games. Thank you for playing!</strong></p>\n\n\r\nMockups and development screenshots\r\n\n<strong>One of the first mockups, drawn over a game prototype</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Second prototype with rough game sprites</strong>\n\n\n<strong>\n\r\nConcept sketches for the game\r\n</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60eef1c05607bbd544b29776db1fc4f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RebelGameStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
