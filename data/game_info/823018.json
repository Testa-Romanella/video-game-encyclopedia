A game about rescuing an all-powerful hamburger is pretty odd compared to most of my other games. This is because this is a remaster of the FIRST EVER GAME that I have EVER MADE. The original game was made in the late summer of 2015 with the same title and premise. The original game is now lost media, with this newer port being a complete remaster of the original since the original only had 3 stages and that the original was copied onto a singular disk which was super outdated and is now in some junkyard. Enjoy the new game, I can assure that it is actually pretty good for its premise! :)<br/></p>\n<p>------ Story ------\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as <strong>Lustig</strong>, the smiling square and must rescue the <strong>all-powerful</strong> hamburger from the <strong>spoiled milk</strong> before he uses it for <strong>evil</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>------ Gameplay ------\r\n</p>\n<p>You <strong>navigate different areas</strong> such as <strong>grassy terrains, underground caves, and a castle fortress</strong> with enemies, and the spoiled milk guarding the finish!\r\n</p>\n<p>------ Credits ------\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created by Scott Zimmerman (@ScottZimmerman)\u00a0and was made using Clickteam Fusion 2.5!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T20:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/930/93083cba80a0aa71cdad0e9fa2125e7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Scott Zimmerman"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
