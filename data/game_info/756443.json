Thank you to GWriter Studio for the music!</p>\n<p>A decrepit Home has neighbored yours for many years, falling further into disarray as the years go by. Lately it has begun to haunt your dreams with visions of monsters and pus dripping from the cracks in the walls.</p>\n<p>Your mental state has deteriorated much like the rotting Home that lives beside you. Finally it has been enough.</p>\n<p>Tonight you will venture into the Home to destroy it once and for all. Once you enter however, you realize that the Home is not all that it seems.</p>\n<p>The Home's doors are non-linear, meaning they may connect to many different rooms and going back through the same door may not take you to the same place.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a426bcc55e07c1839976a83afd79b65b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JunoStrunk"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
