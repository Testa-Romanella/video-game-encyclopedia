XD</p>\n<p>Hi, This is my second LD game.<br/>It's an out of space bus simulator.\u00a0 XD</p>\n<p>When I was a student, I felt out of space every day because there are so many people on public transportations.<br/>And here is the OVERLOADED, hopefully, it can remind you of some experience with buses. XD</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>There is a simple tutorial level.</p>\n<p>And here are some simple instruction. ( Same as the tutorial)<br/>1. Click doors to open or close it.<br/>2. Passenger must buy tickets near the driver.// Passenger will have a number above head after buying the ticket.<br/>3. Click passenger number to push them.// The number is where its owner wants to go. ( bus stop 1,2,3,4, \u2026.)<br/>4. Click driver to move to next station.<br/>5. Click driver to end the game at the final station.<br/>6. Open and close doors can solve stuck.</p>\n\n<p>Efficiency = (Deliver - Complaint)*3600/Time.<br/>Higher efficiency is better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by rainysoolar(.etc) &amp; wuyan(audio)</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for your playing!</strong></p>\n<p>Ludum Dare page :https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/overloaded</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/735e522944c31d2b3bbe43e03a7a2228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["rainysolar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
