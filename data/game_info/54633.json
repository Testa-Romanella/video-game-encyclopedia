{"id": 54633, "slug": "daytona-usa-2001", "name": "Daytona USA 2001", "name_original": "Daytona USA 2001", "description": "<p>Daytona USA 2001, known in North America simply as Daytona USA, is a racing arcade game developed by Sega and Genki which is a complete revamp of Daytona USA for release on the Dreamcast platform. This version features every single course from the original Daytona USA game and the Championship Circuit Edition. Three new tracks were also specially designed for this game (&#39;Rin Rin Rink&#39;, &#39;Circuit Pixie&#39; and &#39;Mermaid Lake&#39;), and all of the tracks are playable normally, in reverse, mirrored, or in reverse-mirrored mode.<br />\nThe game&#39;s graphics were significantly updated from previous home installments of Daytona USA, more resembling the likes of Daytona USA 2. It was also playable online, allowing for competition between up to four players and uploading/downloading of best times and ghost car information, although the online options were removed from the PAL version. The Dreamcast&#39;s online servers for both Alien Front Online and Daytona USA 2001 were taken down permanently by mistake as a result of the developers hard-coding the IP-address to the servers in the game and Sega giving away a network block that belonged to AT&amp;T. Another addition to Daytona USA 2001 was the Championship mode, where the player must place above a certain point in the overall rankings to progress, culminating in the King of Daytona Cup.<br />\nThis version tends to be criticized for poor controls. The analog stick&#39;s default setting is extremely sensitive, but that can be corrected in the options screen (except in the Japanese version). However, the game still does not handle exactly like the original arcade version of Daytona USA even when using a racing wheel. The physics, handling, and control are different from the arcade version. Though it is likely that the game has its game mechanics derived from Shutok\u014d Battle 2, and was designed with analog controls in mind and therefore doesn&#39;t play as easily on a joypad as the Sega Saturn versions which used a standard d-pad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-31T01:39:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/102/10223406afe516e0cd173a75c0ec906a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Amusement Vision", "GENKI"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Infogrames", "Hasbro Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
