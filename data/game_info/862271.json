In talking with a friend (who knows how to code and is helping with Gunpowder Tea), we decided that just like Gunpowder Tea, my ideas are too much for GB Studio.\u00a0Especially with my lack of coding knowledge.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0owe my jumping into making games to GB Studio, but it's time to jump to the next thing. We're now in the early stages of making Spaceroach Records in modern game engines, with hopes of a full proper release.</p>\n<p>For now, I\u00a0hope you enjoy this version. It will likely change - and it will have much more music - but I'm proud of what we did in here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T12:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/01582e01feda303e398b92ba6d67739f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A Study in Expression"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
