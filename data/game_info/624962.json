It is planned to be a free-roam/sandbox game, and you can do quite a lot already. At the moment only a Demo is released for the public.</p>\n\n<p>The final game will be completely free! Just like the demo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this game, you can make choices. Hundreds of choices, you can choose your starting magic element or you could settle down and make a nice home. Or you could just rob everyone in the game and become the richest of all. Possibilities are endless<br/>(possibilities aren't endless in the demo as the demo only has a small portion of the features of the full game.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T05:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08af9dde40b1f49698fabfb94a886b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glitched Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
