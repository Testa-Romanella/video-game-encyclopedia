(demo)", "description": "<p>Hello and thank you for stopping by to check out the demo for my project!</p>\n<p>I Didn't Mean to Become a Villain! takes the standard fantasy RPG narrative and flips it on its head. In this game you aren't playing as a character destined for greatness or the chosen one meant to save the world. Instead you play as a petty criminal who is truly down on their luck. Pick locks and loot everything that isn't nailed down if it strikes your fancy or try to beat the odds by holding onto some semblance of morality while doing what needs to be done to survive.</p>\n<p>This game is not suitable for children but also it isn't porn so use your best discretion I guess. Fair bit of swearing, some blood, alcohol use, etc.<br/></p>\n<p>This demo was put together in exactly 2 months and 2 days by a single person working tirelessly with RPG Maker MV and Aseprite. As more content is developed it will be added to this free demo until it stretches all the way from your first crimes to completing the second dungeon. For now please enjoy the first 2 nights of the game!</p>\n<p>Plans for the full release include: 6 dungeons, a branching story, multiple endings, tons of sidequests, pickpocketing, unlockable Titles that alter your stats and skills, &amp; fishing (because I hear folks like that in their games)! <br/></p>\n<p>On a final note I do apologize for all of the temporary character portraits. Getting this demo playable took priority over making those assets. Also Hard Mode is by no means a balanced experience yet and only really in the demo as a proof of concept. I don't actually know how fair the fights will be if you choose it at this time. You have been warned.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T10:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/6262d994693640a8d5b09d7b0e040715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["invalid_user621"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
