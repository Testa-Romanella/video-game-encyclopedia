It is currently in an extremely early testing stage that showcases mechanics of the weapons and movement around a close quarters map.  This stage is also to allow followers to report bugs and suggestions.  Keep in mind that this is being solo-developed so long term changes can take time to implement.  Thanks for following and have fun playing!\r\n</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT - The download above is for the launcher which will prompt you for an update.  Then the main game will download.  This is in place so that dynamically updating the game is possible.

If the launcher is not responding after install, you need to run it as admin as you probably installed it into program files x86.\r\n</li><li>My installer won\u2019t work.  Probably windows defender preventing it from opening.\r\n</li><li>My graphics changes won\u2019t apply in game.\u00a0 Some graphics options are broken due to the upgraded rendering for the project...this will be fixed later on.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68bddf27e382e16ef46172b506cd4afc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlapChickenGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
