It is a 2d platformer based on the theme, and I think it is quite interesting. This will be my first publicly available game, and first game jam game. This was a lot of fun, and this definitely was a learning experience. Thank you for this experience!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8e4c6a2641e4f370350662a1103ed34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OrangeScientist1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
