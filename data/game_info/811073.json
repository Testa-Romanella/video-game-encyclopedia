This is not my style, it was inspired by a youtuber/Unity game dev\u00a0aarthificial\u00a0(\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/aarthificial/videos\u00a0) pls check him out, his game looks amazing.<br/> Also because I haven't ask to use his style sooooo, aarthificial if somehow you saw this and don't want me to use the style I will gladly and respectfully change the style. It just that the style is cute and bit easier to work with :P</p>\n<p>3. Yes there still a lot of problem with this mainly the color system so if any of you who have more experience in Gdevelop than me, pls educate me ('-'\u00a0 )</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made this because character customization my favorite thing to do in game so I tried to learn to make it to see how hard is it. The purpose is also to encourage and help people inspired to create their OCs when they out of ideas\u00a0so hopefully you have a kicked out of this broken mess at least\ud83e\udd1e. Also you better use your device screenshot for now cuz this version screenshot is a mess &lt;_&lt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:58:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa5fa96ab7e7a23a0ed15ddb42da733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hey!
