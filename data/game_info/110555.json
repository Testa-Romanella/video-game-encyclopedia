This game aims to fill that role, and hopefully make you understand their feelings a little bit better.</p><p>If you have suicidal desires, please seek help from friends, family and professionals.</p><p>Thank you for playing.</p><p>Gameplay notes:</p><p>The dark scenes are not intuitive to play, and there are no instructions. Sorry about that. I\u2019ll give you this hint: You don\u2019t have to click on anything after the jump. Just move your mouse around and things will happen.</p><p>Development notes:</p><p>I made this game by myself in three and a half days. The music is also by me.
