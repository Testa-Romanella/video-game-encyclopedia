My submission to the Pixeland Monthly Challenge - Create a single screen game using M\u00f4si.</p>\n<p>The M\u00f4siying King is a simple puzzle game. Your objective is to build up a village, gain resources, and finally upgrade your castle. Interact with the workshop to cycle through buildings, and see if you can complete the game!<br/></p>\n<p>M\u00f4si is a very simple game engine that I would describe in one word. Hell. For some reason, though, it was extremely entertaining with all the restrictions. Took me a while to figure some things out, but it really is a very good piece of software.</p>\n<p>I've attached my game's source code as a mosi file for those who are interested in looking. It contains some quite interesting methods, especially to display the resources at the top of the canvas.</p>\n<p>You can use M\u00f4si here: https://zenzoa.itch.io/mosi</p>\n<p>and you can find details of the Pixeland Monthly Challenge here: https://pixeland.io/monthly-challenge</p>\n<p>and you can find me on Twitter. I do all sorts of gamedev crap and am releasing a pixel art asset pack very soon! https://twitter.com/nateonus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e906bec17dc8d8514f345803ba07c24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nateonus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
