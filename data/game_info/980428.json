{"id": 980428, "slug": "emoji-connect", "name": "Emoji Connect", "name_original": "Emoji Connect", "description": "The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by matching emojis of the same type before time runs out. When you combine two emojis, you gain time. The bigger the combination, the more time you get. In this way, the best players can extend the game indefinitely.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are ten types of emojis which, as you combine them, increase in size. The complexity of the game increases the more points you score. Emojis can rotate on themselves, increase their speed, change their position or appear somewhere in the game circle at random.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe top five daily, weekly and monthly scores are recorded in their corresponding rankings, but only the top five scores of all time can be recorded in the world ranking. After your game, if you make it to the top, enter your three-character username and don't let anyone else beat you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T11:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52a/52a6f020c1bb2439602b2e5202f8655f.jpg", "website": "https://emoji-connect.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jomego76"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["GAMEZ-STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
