The gun has a fully fleshed out stat system with the ability to dynamically switch out gun pieces on the fly to change the stats. I wanted the game to be borderlands like but with my own niche of having a singular gun that you rebuild instead of new ones.</p>\n<p>It also features an inventory system built into the gun menu to easily swap out gun pieces at the different nodes of the gun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T07:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd1659cb3578da504b78ece4be6a80af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wesley Earl Stander"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
