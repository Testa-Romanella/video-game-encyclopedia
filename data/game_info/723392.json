Don't expect anything fancy. <br/></p>\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>- Use WASD to move.</p>\n<p>- Use ARROW keys to shoot.</p>\n<p>- There will be various shapes that spawn throughout the game.</p>\n<p>- Squares do not harm you and will move through you. However, if you shoot a square, you die.</p>\n<p>- Circles will kill you if you collide with one.</p>\n<p>- Triangles will shoot smaller triangles towards you which will kill you on impact. Also, you will die if you collide with regular-sized triangles.</p>\n<p>- You can shoot triangles and circles to earn points, but not squares.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy! (or not)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:02:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44d77aefaa586349caebded331a6c3c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["celadonbanana"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
