What if you made a few revisions? What's the worse that could happen. What kind of revisions do you want to make?\u00a0 What will be the consequences?</p>\n<p>The pillars of society await you, but only if you can nimbly jump from one to the other in order to gain access to each destination's password. Once you have a destination's password, remember it and use it to revise the programmed destinations at each location.<strong> </strong><strong>There is a weird bug that it might not take a password the first try (it will say the password is invalid when it is correct), so try 2 or 3 times and it should take. The issue is that it doesn't always save the input the first time. Should be fixed in version 004.</strong></p>\n<p>You can jump (and double-jump!)\u00a0on resources moving between pillars to help you get across, and if you fall you can \"restart\"\u00a0or rather respawn (<strong>but sometimes over nothing so just keep respawning or Reload the level</strong>).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move, SPACEBAR to jump, and Left-mouse click or Trackpad click to log into a location when you are standing on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the ESC key to pause, restart/respawn, reload, and quit.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and this is most important my Best Beloved, most pillars (not all) require a resource to exist. Once they run out of that resource they will eventually collapse. Don't forget that when you start muddling with things!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T10:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dd/6dd761a93a6b98407295bb10eea68e49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Andybyte"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
