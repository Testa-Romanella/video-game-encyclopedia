Scope's none-explicit narrative was open ended in how a player may interpret\u00a0it but was originally designed to show the journey of a idea being created, it's growth through various processes and it's eventual birth into creativity or it's destruction at the hand of scope management.</em>\n\r\nWhat I learned...\r\n<p>Over the course of developing Scope, ironically I had to make the decision to pivot development and cut the initial scope of the project down in order for it to be completed/playable within the time-frame I had been working on it. My initial scope for this project was too big and mid-development it was cut down to 1/3 of it's original size.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d14/d1437745d51840618cc5f9cd35447141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Winzar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
