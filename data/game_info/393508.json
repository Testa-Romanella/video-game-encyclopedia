Little did we know that &quot;Whacko Jacko&quot; had laid out the blueprint for the seminal game of our generation - a game so gory, so brutal, so devoid of logic and morals that it would make Postal 2 seem like Ms. Pacman. A game so terrible, so repulsive, that a 60-year old serial killer squeezed out his first tear in 40 years when he played the beta. The BETA.</p>\n<p>Consisting of 3 alcoholics and a foreign exchange student, Thompsonsoft is a new game company formed around the singular idea that Jack Thompson is the most brilliant game designer in the universe. After reading &quot;A Modest Video Game Proposal&quot;, we formed this company to create any game that Jack Thompson designed. Our first title, &quot;I&#39;m OK&quot;, is based on Jack&#39;s masterful design from &quot;A Modest Video Game Proposal&quot; and it&#39;s a murder simulator so cruel, so bloodthirsty, so horrifyingly violent that it makes Grand Theft Auto seem like Sunday Funday.</p>\n<p>How does one explain why, in a world overflowing with disease, war, and other horrifying realities, a man would spend 18 years crusading against video games? Easy. You say that it&#39;s the most extensive, ingenious marketing campaign for a video game in the history of MAN.</p>\n<p>Not since John Romero made us all his bitch have you been this excited about a game, and now it&#39;s finally here in your sweaty little hands. We hope you enjoy it. (But only if you&#39;re an 18-and-over adult with no prior convictions.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T15:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03def4d78a5bfac20c3f36aad053cc52.jpg", "website": "http://www.imok.gzwn.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derek Yu"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
