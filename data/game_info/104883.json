With the help of a time-travelling polar bear.</p><p>At least, that's the concept for the\u00a0<em>full\u00a0</em>game. The version you can play here is\u00a0a prototype  made in a few for the 2018 Climate Jam. It's more of a blueprint for a full\r\ngame than it is a complete game in its own right.</p><p>I hope to revisit the project in the future and flesh it further by including, for example, mini-games that show what we as humans can and should be doing to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Until then, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecda3f8e0845d025e99c44d3d23244ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Karn Bianco"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
