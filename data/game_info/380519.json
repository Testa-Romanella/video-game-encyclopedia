It is my first GameBoy game and I made it with GB Studio (https://www.gbstudio.dev/). The development time of this jam game was something between 7-10 hours and within that timeframe it was possible to learn the tool and play around with some features. The .gp file can be used to play the game on your GameBoy if you happen to have SD card adapter. Enjoy the Footure!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/>Game design, art &amp; code: Annakaisa Kultima<br/>Music: Lauri Leskinen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a61fb6526775a636c95b48cab3406e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AaKoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
