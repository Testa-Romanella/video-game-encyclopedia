The map is now generated procedurally,\u00a0so\u00a0each run will be unique, I hope you like this new version! ^^<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/6320451572056ef5f0d775cea810e202.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KakuGames"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
