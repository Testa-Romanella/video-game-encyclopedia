He is out of luck, but he is aiming to buy the golden hook and finally catch the Golden Marlin (fish).\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, what he does not know is that the villagers are not very friendly, and are trash-talking him behind his back. Will you befriend them and earn their trust? Or will you go a more sinister route?</p>\n<p>Play using your mouse to click on the screen, and dragging downwards when out at sea, to hear what the villagers say when Santiago is not around.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made in 48 hours at\u00a0Nordic Game Jam 2021</p>\n\n<p>Horatiu Roman - programming, game design</p>\n<p>Lars Bindslev - graphics, game design</p>\n<p>Julian\u00a0Hansen - programming, fishing</p>\n<p>Shanty music:</p>\n\n<p>Discord@gminorscale\u00a0</p>\n<p>Discord@amnara\u00a0</p>\n<p>Discord@Joachim - Sound Design</p>\n\n<p>Gloomy Town song:\u00a0@horatiuromantic\r\n</p>\n\n<p>External plugins:</p>\n<p>Amplify Shader Editor<br/></p>\n<p>Easy Character Movement</p>\n<p>Shapes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/286b22aad03582d71eaf4814c9732dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lars", "horatiuromantic", "julian42"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
