To incorporate the theme into our game, you'll play through various mini games, each lasting only 2 seconds! On top of that, you've only got two chances, which are displayed as the bull and cow. We also decided that the art would be in two colors. All assets were made within the jam timeframe.</p>\n<p>We were able to add 12 bizarre mini games in the two days we had, each with multiple levels of difficulty.\u00a0Have fun and don't get abducted!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Each mini game controls a little different, but each uses only the mouse.</p><p>Credits</p><p>Luke: code, art, design</p><p>Austen: art, music, sfx, design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1aa/1aa1791d3fabe9641b53097db9c4755b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bifflestein"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
