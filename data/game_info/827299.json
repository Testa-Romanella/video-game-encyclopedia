Part 2 of a 4-part series that spans multiple worlds and introduces new and familiar faces, your generous donation helps buy me the time to complete this epic quest!</p>\n<p>This game can be played with keyboard+mouse, gamepad, or a touch interface. It is highly recommended that you save early and often. There are occasional instances where an enemy will get caught in an infinite pathing loop that softlocks the game during battle. This issue will hopefully be resolved in an upcoming update, but for now, it occurs rarely enough that I\u00a0felt comfortable releasing the game.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Ottomania Part II: Wild Juice Chase!</p>\n<p>If you are interested in supporting this and other projects, consider becoming a Patron for ongoing updates, early access to playtest builds, and more:</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/rain101</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfb/bfb08c23ab335ce9c7003dd1065b86be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rain101"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
