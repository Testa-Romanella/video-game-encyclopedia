The objective of the game is to survive as long possible.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move: WASD and Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Attack: Space</p>\n<p>Interact: X (open the door)</p>\n<p>Keep Orientation : Shift</p>\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n<p>Currently, the only weapon is the Katana. In the future I plan to add a lot more weapons. This would be done by adding a shop and inventory.\u00a0 My plans are to make the enemies to drop coins. This would be used in the shop to buy new weapons. A healing system will also be introduced using the shop. The idea will be to choose between better weapons or healing.</p>\n<p>I also intend to add more enemies. Currently, the waves scale by linearly increasing the number of skeletons\u00a0 that spawn. However, this is dumb and boring. Therefore, I intend to add a greater variety of enemies and make the wave system better.</p>\n<p>The map will also be expanded. However as this is meant to be an arena game I don't have plans to make a dungeon map.</p>\n<p>the obvious one ADD SOUND!!!!!
