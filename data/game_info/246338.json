{"id": 246338, "slug": "bowlympus-vr", "name": "Bowlympus VR", "name_original": "Bowlympus VR", "description": "<p>This game was a simple exercise in my C# development courses on Unity, but things got a little out of hand, and I ended up with a prototype of a Greek \u00a0mythology themed VR bowling game, with some different environments, monsters and power-ups... so why not share it ? This is still an early-stage version, there's a lot of\u00a0improvement to be done on graphic and sound design, and I plan on adding levels, bonuses and other stuff, but I think it's already quite enjoyable. So have a go, have fun with your big balls, and you're very welcome to express any thoughts - good or bad - you have on the game, and of course to report any bug you may come across. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba7928487ac8570975d327a11356ccf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stabeor"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
