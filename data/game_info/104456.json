The purpose of the jam was to promote positivity and diversity in the games industry. I made Hammerhead High because I wanted to make people laugh, and I also wanted to draw adorable sharks. I liked\u00a0Hatoful Boyfriend and Tsundere Shark Reddit\u00a0so why not.</p>\n<p>I'd like to make\u00a0a full-length version of Hammerhead High one day.<br/></p>\n<p>Hammerhead High was build in the Ren'py visual novel engine. I would highly recommend this engine to anyone interested in creating interactive fiction.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Credits:</strong><br/> Cover art by Jocelyn Kim<br/> Background art by Cameron Koller</p>\n<p><strong>Music sources:</strong></p>\n<p> \"Carefree\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\"Colorless Aura\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\"Easy Lemon (60 second)\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>\"Let it Go\" by MayJ, Frozen Japanese soundtrack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d245ef473c6ed6d27e3967c9c3b3d11d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Catherine Fox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
