The Golem is about having a lot of potential that you wrap up in someone else\u2019s bullshit. The kid who is eternally in the shadow of someone else because they don\u2019t feel like they are up to the task or even as a clever shield from consequences. No matter what direction they are taken the Golem is intrinsically tied into drama.</em></p>\n<p>The Golem is a Skin about being the Ron, the The Billy, the Cordelia of a group of friends. You may be important, you may be the best fighter, but you are a vizier, a secondary player behind a power. Your power just happens to be another character.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy delving into co-dependence and the vizier/muscle role that can befall so many in high school. Discover yourself through others. See how far you can push the envelope before your relationships begin to fray.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6d9c669b1cb29504778ab4caaa3f9df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
