{"id": 19278, "slug": "blood-one-unit-whole-blood", "name": "Blood", "name_original": "Blood", "description": "<p>You&#39;ll battle cultists, gargoyles, zombies, hellhounds, and an unholy host of other terrors in your quest to stop Tchernobog. You must not only defeat the Cabal - you must scour its dread name from human memory. If that means eradicating everyone and everything the Cabal has ever tainted, so be it. Of course, you&#39;ll first have to make your way through fortresses, castles, mines, mansions, and estates guarded and kept by Tchernobog&#39;s malevolent servants. Fortunately, it is wits that make the hero, and although you&#39;re in serious danger of losing yours, you&#39;ve got enough left to improvise some pretty effective tools of destruction. Aerosol hairspray can be frightening enough on its own, but apply it to a lighter flame and you&#39;ve got an instant flamethrower (kids, don&#39;t try this at home!). Likewise, a flare gun can brighten your prospects considerably against even the grimmest odds, which is to say nothing for shotguns, Tommy guns, and dynamite. Who knows, you may even find that there are some spirits on your side when you find yourself clutching a voodoo doll.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "1997-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b74fccd30274db00ef51b97b41862c.jpg", "website": "https://www.ludomo.com/game_blood/", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 487, "beaten": 98, "toplay": 36, "dropped": 58, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 156, "suggestions_count": 481, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 156, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Monolith Productions", "3D Realms", "Ludomo Gamestudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GT Interactive Software", "Ludomo Gamestudio"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
