The artstyle in my opinion isn't the best and the demo/prototype is just meant for seeing whether people would like more/a continuation of this game. Plus, since I work on this game every day, this demo is a little outdated.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T00:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/9339f56b7e7bba6ae5b812e8bbd47187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Domkrats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
