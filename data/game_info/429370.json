Got to maintain a healthy social distance of course!</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game for the Arduboy! If you got one, you can upload the .hex file. If you don't, no problem! You can play it on an online emulator:</p>\n<p>https://felipemanga.github.io/ProjectABE/?url=https://community.arduboy.com/uploads/short-url/tDhSFHoyFSrMawGHAXNMEYPkgs5.hex<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>D-PAD: Movement</li><li>A/B - Pause</li></ul>\n\n<p>While the basic premise came from the COVID-19 pandemic, this game is in no way trying to make slight of the situation. Practice social distancing, wash your hands regularly + maintain good hygiene. The sooner you play your part, the sooner we overcome. Please be safe out there!</p>\n<p>Made in the Caribbean with \u2665</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/499dd9bb230936f4c2953ada5d09253c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcus Sanatan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
