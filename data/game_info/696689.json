{"id": 696689, "slug": "drops-of-light", "name": "Drops of Light", "name_original": "Drops of Light", "description": "<p>Drops of Light is a game designed to tease both the visual and logical parts of your brain featuring original graphics and music.  Inspired by color physics, peg solitaire, and a Chinese Checkers board, Drops of Light is a puzzle in the purest sense of the word: as you play, you will have no time constraints and no elements of chance to obstruct your progress, only the puzzle and as much time and patience as you can muster to crack it.  The game is played on a six-pointed crystalline lattice filled with photons of various colors, and your task is to move them around and blend them together in order to form a specified arrangement within a limited number of moves.\r\nThe standard level set provides 60 levels of varying difficulty, starting with a hands-on tutorial to teach you the basics.  Additional levels are available, and, using the level editor (included), you can try your hand at making your own challenges to tease other Drops of Light fans.\r\nThe most recent version of the game, released in 2007, is a revitalization of the 1998 classic.  It features more vibrant, easier-to-distinguish graphics, and a remastered version of the original level set with a smoother difficulty curve.  Though somewhat dated, <em>Drops of Light</em> received critical acclaim in its prime including Allegro.cc\u2019s Groovy Game Alert and consistently high ratings on GameHippo.com.  We are continuing to provide downloads, free as always, for those seeking a bit of late-90\u2019s nostalgia.\r\n</p>\n<p>Version 3.0 requires Windows 95 or later, and will still run (albeit under protest) on Windows 10.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/867b9bce425b3b4eba2fcea09ebce2a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tursiops Truncatus Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
