Let me know what you think by posting on the discussion boards!<br/><br/>\"Don't Feed\" uses an isometric 2D art style, which helps to maximize the number of units that can be on the battlefield. There are no heroes, because I feel that controlling a hero warrants its own game (e.g. \"DOTA\"). This game instead focuses on the RTS play style.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03dd5cc13727452a993085bde93db2b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ravinia"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
