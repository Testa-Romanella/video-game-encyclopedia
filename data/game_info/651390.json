So what is Mini 4WD?<br/><br/>Mini 4WD is any miniature model within the mini scale of between 1/20 (1:20) to 1/48 (1:48) scale. Currently, the term is popularized predominantly by a 1/32 (1:32) scaled, AA battery powered plastic model race car without remote control. All four (4) wheels are direct-drive, thus \"\"4WD\"\" for 4-wheel drive, as opposed to \"\"AWD\"\" or All-wheel drive. Horizontal side rollers guide the vehicle against the vertical walls of the un-banked track for steering, providing very fast speeds up to 65 km/H (40 mph) on the track. In Japan, Mini 4WD is also known as mini yonku (\u30df\u30cb\u56db\u99c6) in Japanese. Though mostly popular in Asia, they are sold in many countries as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Italy, United States and the Netherlands.<br/><br/>** Real Racing with Mini 4WD! **<br/><br/><br/>Visit Mini Legend Facebook &amp; Customer Service Page: MiniLegend4WD<br/>or Email: cs@twitchyfinger.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T20:55:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/872643cd4d7285a0bfb862ec242799d7_aWbkEYQ.jpg", "website": "http://www.twitchyfinger.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Twitchy Finger"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Twitchy Finger"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
