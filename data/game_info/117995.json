As such, it's both personal and of its time. I'd say more, but the closest way to convey that feeling to you is to have you play the game.</p><p>While you can play it by yourself, taking turns with other people adds to the experience. You'll see what I mean when you play it.</p><p>The original concept was to create a game that could be played in a public space, such as a gallery. One of the underlying themes is communication with strangers. Playing the game by yourself, playing the game with strangers, and playing the game with friends: each produces a subtly different effect. I wanted to try to communicate emotions through the act of playing (alone or together).</p><p>I like to think that you'll figure out pretty quickly if it speaks to you or not.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/4879d2968a251f378d2eed4d1d830e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ikarth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
