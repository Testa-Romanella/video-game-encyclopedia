There are two evil alien lifeguards who want to eat you - good thing they can't go into the water! Collect the orbs to buy your way out.</p>\n<p>This was created for the Game Dev Unlocked Game Jam #4! The theme was \"Under Water\"</p>\n<p>We had 72 hours for the jam, but I, unfortunately,\u00a0ended up with conflicts and couldn't take the whole time and there are some features I didn't get to implement. Originally, there was going to be a voice in the Mushroom house you could talk with, and the doll in one of the pools would talk, and the monsters were going to have noises etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As disappointed as I\u00a0am that I ran out of time, I still had a blast and learned a lot! I can't wait to play everyone else's submissions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I took a break from developing my first game, Worm Goes To Hell to participate in this.It's available to wishlist on Steam now, and it would mean the world to me if you did so! It'll be releasing here on Itch and on Steam in 2023, so if Steam isn't your thing you can follow me here for updates. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T17:43:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/0341eb5ffb8973148c2734ca83009835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MTGJoeD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
