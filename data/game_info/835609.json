Many have tried and failed, but The King seems to trust in your skills. Along the way you will collect gems which grant you unique powers.</p>\n<p>Default resolution is 64x64, as per LOWREZJAM's rules, but you can optionally play with higher resolutions and textures turned on (shown in the screenshots).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>E - Interact (Open doors, chests etc.)</li><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Left-click - Attack</li><li>Shift - Sprint</li><li>Esc - Open settings menu</li></ul>\n<p>This project is pretty sloppy and unfinished. I\u00a0wanted to do a lot more originally, and probably will continue making it after the jam. I have made a first area, with a boss battle, and started making a second area, just to preview the main enemy in that area.</p>\n<p>Linux and Mac builds not tested.</p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/jorickhoofd/sounds/178658/ (Modified)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/412068/ (Modified)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FunWithSound/sounds/361485/ (Modified)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Jamius/sounds/41529/ (Modified)</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/614724/ (Modified)</p>\n<p>https://soundbible.com/1348-Large-Fireball.html (Modified)</p>\n<p>Plus other sounds and textures from freesound.org and ambientcg.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/424bbf1b8d97b806e07f59df9072c126.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["James"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
