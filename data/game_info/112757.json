It's not pretty.<br/> <br/>A team of four fire-forged friends have risen to challenge Dark Lord Orion and end the Demon Wars that have plagued their world for centuries. It's time for a good old happy ending with no strings attached, right? <br/></p><p>But one final thread of Fate is left to be unwoven. <br/> <br/>Something strange shatters the momentary calm. The body of our hero, Swiftheart, is suddenly and strangely altered into something not at all ordinary. Suspecting a curse, the team assembles once more to find the source of the spell and stop it. <br/> <br/>What they'll find instead is a horrible truth, and one last wild adventure.<br/> <br/>Gameplay: <br/>The End uses the \"Aggression\"-based combat system seen in Illusions of Loyalty. Do you spend your Aggression now and gain an advantage? Or will you bank it for use on a more powerful skill later, and risk missing a window of opportunity? <br/> <br/>The game also features many unique offensive and defensive pieces of gear that grants special bonuses to whomever they are equipped to, from free attacks to gaining energy when attacked.</p><p>Thematic origins:<br/>The End was originally made for an event on RPGmaker.net, where we were tasked with creating a game built solely with assets other users created for the event.<br/><br/>Given the wealth of great-looking retro tilesets and sprites, I decided to make a game based on a \"devolving art-style\", and this was the result.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f78/f78a177fbebbe188897a7863a15aa2fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aegix Drakan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
