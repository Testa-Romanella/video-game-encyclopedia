A purple skull underneath means the attack is poisonous. If there's a purple bubbles icon above a hp-bar: the character's poisoned.</p>\n<p>Also, for downloading: extract all three files from the .zip to a single map, then doubleclick the .exe file to play.</p><p>Tell me what you think of the mechanics if you happen to play it in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/744/744eab80f567c0d2f137ae874398a18d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MelonoDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
