The player can command their own character and control a range of weapons in a suitable testing environment showcasing the vehicles and weapons included in this game. The player has a range of options available allowing testing of a variety of bullet calibres in a number of scenarios from a air resistance to impact mechanics. The ballistics system in this project is suitable for a military simulation style game and could even be modified into a DLC and applied to a current game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Designed to be as realistic as possible with bullets replicating real world projectile movement with as much accuracy as available utilising the appropriate mathematical formulas for calculating air resistance (drag), wind deviation, energy requirements for penetration and much more.\r\n</p><p>The document contains supporting formulas, methodology and testing of the prototype against real world examples and calculators to reinforce the success of implementation. While there is no design documentation for the vehicles, they are loosely based on the TOW Launcher, M1 Abrams tank, and the militarised Little Bird helicopter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2f57646d15e6ef4d9f9ccd75bfbb264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JackWilkes"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
