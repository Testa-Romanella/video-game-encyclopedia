Three years ago, you assaulted a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Florida, while you were transferred to\u00a0Skeleforest, home of the famous 'Forest Cottage' Air BnB.</p>\n<p>Air BnB\u00a0is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste facilities on Mars and some parts of Tasmania.\u00a0With no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' dust and watchin' restricted flicks in the rec room.\r\n</p>\n<p>For the last four years the military, Air\u00a0BnB's biggest supplier has used the remote facilities in Tasmania to conduct various secret projects, including research on sick skeleton dance moves. So far they have been able to open a pretty great bed and breakfast in the forest,\u00a0throwing a few guests into one and watching them come out after their stay. Recently however, the Air BnB\u00a0has grown dangerously unstable. Skeleton \"guests\" entering them have either busted a move\u00a0or been stricken with a strange form of boogie fever, bludgeoning any beat that plays,\u00a0and finally suffering an untimely death by full-body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to the folks became a full-time job. Latest Air BnB\u00a0reports state that the research is suffering a small set-back, but everything is under control.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:03:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/070637eb5b9b3a6b6a77b102a4dc4884.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HonkingHonk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
