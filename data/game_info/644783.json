Look into your memories, clean your house, fight against your fear, explore your world and talk with your imaginary friends to be brave once more!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVirtual Amusement is a single player VR puzzle game. You explore your own house, find hidden objects, and find your way to the other rooms, and eventually outside. To complete the puzzles, you need to enter the imaginary world through the merry-go-round music box. In the imaginary amusement park, you can play mini-games with your emoticon friend and win hearts to purchase quest items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVR-specific interactions, for instance nodding or shaking your head to communicate with NPCs, or pinch your cheek to return to the real world, will enrich your VR experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T03:42:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0fe03bf7a05655fe110515d96e3c61c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Myaune"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Myaune"], "esrb_rating": null}
