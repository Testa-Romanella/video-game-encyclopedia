The games cover a wide variety of styles, genres, and themes as they fight against any definition of \"indie game\" as a genre.</p>\n<p>Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each contributor is paid\u00a0and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.</p>\r\nThis Month's Games\r\n<br/>Q-Cubed (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0Carolyn Lu\r\n\n<p>Q-Cubed is a puzzle platformer where you navigate 3D levels while seeing the world from two orthogonal perspectives</p>\n\r\nThe Nine Lives of Nim: Fortune's Fool (WIN/MAC) by\u00a0Claire Ahuriri-Dunning of Sky Bear Games\r\n\n<p>Where has the Prince of Cats gone? Nim, his servant, leaves the safety of the faerie court to find where the leader of the cat spirits has gone. She finds herself in the city of Vanora, where players will meet many familiar Shakespearean characters. Stuck here for a month until the next full moon, Nim has to navigate the busy city searching for the Prince. Forced to fit in with the humans, she has to learn new skills in classes, or take jobs to make money to survive. Will Nim remain untainted by the mortal world, find her Prince, and return him to Faerie? Or has entering the city of Vanora changed her fate forever?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a narrative life simulation, with a focus on scheduling and exploration.

Keeping a cozy yet fun vibe, you play a master brewer who is more focused on what a customer might need rather than what they want, and that can complicate things. All you need is a deck of playing cards, a handful of six-sided dice, and writing implements. Meanwhile, Enchanted Blend can be a journaling game or thought exercise, whatever best makes your day magical. Create the hot drink you need and use it throughout your day, or create a new blend every time you need something different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All three games are included in The Tea Bundle at a reduced price to raise money for commissioned artwork by the talented and sweet Koshi (@Koshijin on Twitter). The artwork is specifically for Whistling Wolf Caf\u00e9, though any extra will be used for art on another game that will be voted on should we surpass the goal.</p>\n\n\r\ndandelions (WIN/MAC/Linux) by\u00a0lotus\r\n\n<p>a short story collage and a meditation on change. a game about trying to start a new life on a dying planet. memories of dandelions and mushrooms and rooftop campfires. made in rpg maker mv, for the 2020 vextro game jam.</p>\n\n\r\n\r\nNo Honour (WIN) by\u00a0Flavedo\r\n\n<p>A poetry based narrative adventure about Laika - the first dog launched into space by Russia.</p>\n\r\n\r\nPsychological Assessment Test V1.0 (WIN) by\u00a0Tanija\r\n\n<p>Thank you for trying out our free first session for your future therapy and agreeing to try out our in-development new form of psychological analysis - directly from your device at home!\u00a0</p>\n<p>For future diagnosis, please fill out the paper sheets and this questionnaire until the next session.
