{"id": 655464, "slug": "turbo-thrust", "name": "Turbo Thrust", "name_original": "Turbo Thrust", "description": "<p>A racing\u00a0game for Amiga &amp; Amiga emulators. This was my 5th Amiga game, originally released in July 1992.</p>\n<p>Turbo Thrust had various roots of inspiration. Years earlier, I wrote a simple vertical scrolling game on Dragon 32, where a 'Y' flew down a tunnel, and this was a surprisingly addictive hit. Years later, Salamander on the Commodore 64 had a bonus level which involved flying along a tunnel at speed. I wanted to create a race game based on these principles. Early versions of the Turbo Thrust destroyed players when they hit the wall, but this made the game impossibly hard. The game is two player only, and each player uses a joystick. The fire button accelerates. There are no penalties for crashing except losing time.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:33:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/141/1416d7bcb9466909b0dfe525d2014d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
