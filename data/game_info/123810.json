If you do that, he will set your family free.</p><p>Game is about taking choices and relying on luck. Each choice you make gives you different probability of success so you must decide which option is better. </p><p>In our game we have 3 quests and the game chooses one of them randomly at the beginning. If you win or lose, you can play again with a different quest. The quests are: killing the mayor, car theft or bank robbery. </p><p>Not the entire game depends on luck - there are some arcade minigames like connecting cables in a car or shooting a mayor.<br/><br/>Facebooku: https://www.facebook.com/TheSpookyKidsGames?fref=ts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc3/dc3a1d076af8621ba7349f0290b476d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cicha09"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
