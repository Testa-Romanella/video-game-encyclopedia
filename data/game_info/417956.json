You can play the tutorial (which is minimally random) by typing `tutor` on the title screen. The tutorial is complete and should give you a general idea of what I wanted the game to be.</p>\n<p>The main idea was to create a roguelike without any visible dungeons. In this way the servers you hack into are a dungeon's rooms with all the interconnected servers being a single dungeon. Each dungeon is a \"job\" in that you're being paid to hack into the final server and do something there, and jobs would be random in multiple ways.</p>\n<p>Time kind of got away from me and I think I focused on the wrong things (classic move) so the actual job generator is incomplete. However I like the concept so I'm submitting it anyway.\u00a0If you want to see a very broken job (you probably won't be able to hack into more than the first server or two) you can type `start` on the title screen.</p>\n<p>I might revisit this when not under a seven day time crunch because I really enjoy the concept and working on it was surprisingly fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/561c8ada08dc2e482108aa9e47f3525e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mantis-Eye Labs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
