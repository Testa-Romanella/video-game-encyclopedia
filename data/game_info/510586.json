The game depends quite heavily on being a certain frame rate, so if you have a super mega gamer god computer with 500 terabytes of ram everything will go hyper fast and if you have a potato with a keyboard and a screen everything will go super slow and either way it will be unplayable so sorry about that</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01da8ba90a914c662c6be92f6be1a457.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unicorn Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
