Basically it consist in a town (the Outcast slums), a few side quests in the surroundings world map area (the Wasteland) and the first dungeon (the deserted plant).\u00a0 The demo ends when you reach the southern Terraform City. <br/>There is five side quests that can be done to reveal additional side stories and get hidden loots. You will have to speak a couples of times to peoples to get all informations about side stories and quests. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>COMING UP<br/>The demo form the first part of the game. It includes the first town, the surrounding world map areas and the first dungeon. I plan to make around 7 areas as such, to form the whole game. <br/>I\u2019m currently building the maps for the second part of the game, which will entirely take place in Kaali, the southern Terraform City. The big futuristic city will offers good settings for exploration and side quests, while the main dungeon will consist in the infiltration of the TerraCorp Headquarter. The demo will be updated once the second part will be playable.</p>\n\n<p>For more details on the game, please visit the Game In Developement thread on the RPG Make Web forum:</p>\n<p>The Last Continent, game in development thread</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1e7af66280855b8460becd5abbfed72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TSR"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
