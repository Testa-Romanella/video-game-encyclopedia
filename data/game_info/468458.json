I didn't intend for this, but I will absolutely take it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T20:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fae8677aae8375f976ff2c577170628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tertle950"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
