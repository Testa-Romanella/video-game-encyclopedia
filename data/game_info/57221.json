Along with Allumer's Blandia, Time Killers is one of the earliest weapon-based fighting games modeled after Capcom's Street Fighter II (1991). It was later overshadowed by the success of SNK's 1993 weapon-based fighting game, Samurai Shodown. In Time Killers, eight characters from different periods in history face off with each other, and then Death, for a chance at immortality.</p>\n<p>A home port for the Sega Genesis was released four years after the arcade version, after having been delayed and even cancelled for a time.
