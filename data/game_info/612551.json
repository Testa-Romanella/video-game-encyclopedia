The main gimmick is that you can alternate between first person view and a top down camera.</p>\n<p>This project is very poorly optimised, so apologies for any frames per second\u00a0inconveniences.</p>\n<p>If at any point you need a reminder of the control scheme or change the configuration just press ESC to pause the game</p>\n<p>When to game loads you be placed on a sort of hub level, there is a brief tutorial there (just follow the signs).\u00a0 You'll see two portals each one takes you to a different level. In any of them you need to defeat all enemy waves.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun, I'll love to hear any feedback</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c029408b1a890f76dd479c57d62526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octoyisus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
