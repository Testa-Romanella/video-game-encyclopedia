It may be temperamental at times, like with moving platforms and downward falling blocks and such. Since the game is still in development, it is available for free, with optional donations. We are not responsible for any epikness that may occur while playing Warden. If your epikness lasts longer than 4 hours, please consult a doctor or trained professional. Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant have a higher chance of epikness occurring.<br/></p><p>You play as a whip-weilding treasure hunter in the future named Warden. Use your electromagnetic whip to drag blocks, activate generators, smash crates, and kill aliens. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc11e3744ae68ec25ecf255daa409ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SampleText"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
