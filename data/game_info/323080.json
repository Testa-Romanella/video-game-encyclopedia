In each adventure, create your own deck genre, show your wisdom in building strategies and exploring the dungeon!<br/><br/><strong>Game Features:</strong><br/><br/>Game features<br/><br/>\u00b7 Characters with different characteristics: We plan to launch at least 3 characters. Each character has unique energy values \u200b\u200band draw rules to experience different battle ideas and rhythms! (There are only 2 characters in the pre-emptive experience, the future Will expand)<br/>Each character also has an initial deck of different genres and a unique initial sacred object (which requires more than difficulty)! Players can freely match their own genre!<br/><br/>\u00b7 Unique deck construction: Through battles, stores, adventures, get different card packs with different rarities, open the card pack to choose the deck you want to join the deck, or you can use the Runestone to get additional options, or give up this time. Choose to avoid the expansion of the deck!<br/><br/>\u00b7 Unique recirculating dungeon: We deploy dungeon events in the form of cards. Each time we can select one of the three cards to \"advance\" to the location, reasonably plan the route, supply, and fatigue, as much as possible Search for the spoils in the dungeon!<br/><br/>\u00b7 Unique combat system: Enemies don't always have only one, and they don't always stand in a row! Sweeping or traversing? Positional relationship is also an important factor to consider in combat.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Create/decompose the card system: Is the initial card too weak? It doesn't matter. Through the resources acquired in the game, you can upgrade the initial card to a more rare card, or break it down and remove the deck to strengthen the deck strength.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Challenge mode: Unlock the card illustration through the adventure mode, you can use it in the future adventure mode, exhaust your brains, and challenge the high score with the deck! (This mode is not included in the preemptive experience)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>---<br/>Pay tribute to the forerunners on the road (killing the minaret) and (the Hearthstone)!<br/>---", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/3155718d3cdf4fa0f65ed5b48d6900b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5e7b\u60f3\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20\u5f00\u53d1\u7ec4"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["\u5e7b\u60f3\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20\u5f00\u53d1\u7ec4"], "esrb_rating": null}
