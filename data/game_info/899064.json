In this game, you will have to rescue as many presents as possible to help save Christmas, be careful because any presents you miss explode! You have 5 lives plus a bonus life so be careful, the difficulty ramps up to keep you on your toes. I produced all\u00a0the music and sound effects, I also did the coding and particle effects. The art was a mixture: the sleigh presents and parachutes I created but the animated deer was an open-source one I found on the internet, as was the font.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>AD / Arrow keys - control left or right</p>\n<p>S / Down / Space - Stop</p>\n<p>Return -\u00a0 Start (from the menu)</p>\n\n<p>Further Notes:</p>\n<p>Should there be reasonable interest in the game,\u00a0I aim to update the game shortly (this was a one-day game and my first time using unity in a year). Some of the features I aim to add are: post-processing, high scores, and an options menu.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20ed38550ea1a208e347ea26db65d3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["incrediblegames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
