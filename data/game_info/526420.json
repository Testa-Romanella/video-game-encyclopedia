It's not finished unfortunately - But I\u00a0still managed to cover most of the plans I\u00a0had. It did not turn out exactly the way I\u00a0wanted, but I am happy with it anyway.\u00a0 There are some small bugs that I didn't have time to correct before the deadline, and I also miss \"Game Over\" screen, so please accept my apologies for that. It will be better next time, I promise!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1ee50f465b8ee3d8c729292b11515f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["GosiaS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
