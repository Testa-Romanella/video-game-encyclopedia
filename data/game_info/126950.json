The picture is a mock-up of the original idea.</p>\n<p>The idea was to have a submarine survival game in which the player had to juggle multiple systems at a time while dealing with wonky physics.<br/>F.e. mice would damage machinery wich would be disabled and cause other problems. the captain would cause damage to the ship, flooding it in the process.<br/>Many systems would affect each other and cause an steady increase in difficulty with the goal to survive as long as possible.</p>\n<p>But alas the game wasn't finished in time and thus only this \"test\" version is available.<br/>In its current for the game doesn't offer any of the systems fully and only part of the wonky physics.</p>\n<p>No I understand why everybody despises the GM built in physics<br/></p>\r\nControlls:\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement</p>\r\nTeporary Debug Commands:\r\n<p><strong>Y,X</strong> - Spin the ship<br/><strong>J</strong> - Debug overlay<br/><strong>P</strong> - Collision editor (many collision structures wont crash the game but more doesn't always mean better)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f31c8a19553c5136018bc55db01309e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DodgyMerchant"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
