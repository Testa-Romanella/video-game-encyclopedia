The aliens use wormholes to send their troops, which require generators. In order to stop alien troops from stepping through their generated wormholes, our hero has to deactivate all of the generators.<br/></p>\n<p>And maybe even use the alien\u00a0technology to defeat the invaders...</p>\n\n\n<p>We hope you like our game :)</p>\n<p>We are a team of two programmers. We did our best at creating our own 3d models but unfortunately we didn't have enough time to spend on the sound. We also would have liked to add more weapons into the game.</p>\n<p>Let us know what you think about our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4f/b4fe6553b05ce2f3c0f8e3051b4d3e5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirZok"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
