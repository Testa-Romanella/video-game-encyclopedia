Whoever loses 10 HP first loses the game.</p>\n<p>Host a game with \"host\", connect with \"connect [ip]\". Use \"help\" to get a list of all commands.</p>\n<p>Its very easy to create your own deck of cards, just create a .deck file in the same directory as the exe and load it with \"deck [filename]\". Each spell is a line looking like \"Name of the spell#Attack value#Defense value\". Both players need the same deck to play.</p>\n\n\n<p>SOURCE:\u00a0https://github.com/nukaboy/manaduel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c04fbf4d8af660b63db18e8cf742a758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Campo Del Padre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
