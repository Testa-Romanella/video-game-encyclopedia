Players need to fill the squares on the matrix to solve the puzzle. Players need to complete the puzzles of each layer to restore the original face of the 3D object, just like slowly carving a stone into a work of art. The game is easy to get started, and people get into it. The size of the puzzle matrix is relatively small at the beginning, and it will become larger and larger in the later stage. The difficulty is first easy and then difficult, so that you have a process of getting started. <br/>In the later continuous update plan,The game has prepared 100+ levels and a level editor. It will support Steam Workshop in the future.<br/><br/>Voxel Digger is produced by SLASH, a two-person independent game studio from China. I hope everyone can support it.<h3>Feature</h3><ul><li>3D puzzle</li></ul><ul><li>Multiple ways to play</li></ul><ul>Tradition\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>Colour\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>Scenes\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul><li>Rich levels</li></ul><ul>100+\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>5x5\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>10x10\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>15x15\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul>20x20\uff08updating\uff09</ul><ul><li>Level Editor and Steam Workshop\uff08updating\uff09</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3>Voxel Digger is a puzzle game.
