{"id": 901069, "slug": "akuma-sword", "name": "AKUMA Sword", "name_original": "AKUMA Sword", "description": "<p>A simple <strong>2D</strong> platformer in the <strong>Japanese</strong> setting, where You are playing as a samurai demon hunter named <strong>Kenshin</strong> and his henchman demon named <strong>Akuma</strong>, who was in a legendary sword, You need to find the sword broken by THE MEGA EVIL DEMON into <strong>5</strong> <strong>parts</strong>. Your henchman demon was forced to enter the wooden sword, and only he can repair the broken sword.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Made By </strong>Team CHIPSOED /\u00a0Alexander Pak\u00a0</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li>You need to run to the end of the level and get the part of the sword. If you fall behind the map, the level will <strong>restart</strong>, so be CAREFUL when jumping between platforms. In addition, you have <strong>5 lives </strong>against Demons, when the counter reaches zero, the level also starts over.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Your main <strong>enemy and obstacle </strong>is the evil Demons on the level.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Available</strong> to the player:<br/>1. A/D - Move<br/>2. SpaceBar - Jump<br/>3. Destroy Demons by jumping on their heads</li></ul>\n<ul><li>As you <strong>progress </strong>through the game, the level becomes more difficult. As you can see in the game itself, at first you are given a tutorial where the player can get used to the controls and also there is only one Demon on the way.</li></ul>\r\nTechnical part:\r\n<p>Below are screenshots from the Unity Project, where you can see the presence of Prefabs, Rigidbody, Collider2D, Asset Manager and PlayerController connected to the Player. On screenshots also you can see basic HUD, Main Menu, Pause Menu, Option Menu, Completed Level Menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Package Manager of Assets:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hierarchy of Objects:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Inspector of Objects:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Folders in Project:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Links to Music:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\r\n\r\nAddition\r\n<p>The visual style is certainly not quite Japanese. This is due to the fact that I was alone in the team and I didn\u2019t really want to draw everything by hand, as this is a very labor-intensive process in terms of time and effort. So I took the Game Assets from the Unity Asset Store.\u00a0 At least the main character is a bit like a Japanese-style Samurai.\u00a0\u00a0The game also lacks many of the mechanics that I thought they would at the time of design and development. Such as combat, moving platforms. This can be attributed to inexperience in creating games. Despite the excuses I've written here, I hope you enjoy playing AKUMA Sword at least a little bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Best Regards CHIPSOED Team\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc61c40794ab5cb4d197cc0a6b002ef5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BWZN"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
