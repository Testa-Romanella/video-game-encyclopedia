{"id": 510598, "slug": "punchball", "name": "Punchball", "name_original": "Punchball", "description": "<p>This game is your standard pinball sim, but pulling back the plunger is replaced with readying up for a punch. This means you can yeet the ball anywhere, as long as you have good aim. Just don't get stuck in the launch tube.</p>\n<p>You can also save your final score to a leaderboard and compete with others on the same device for the highest score in each category. If you wanna post it online, get a vid of the run or such.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is meant to be played with a touchpad, so you get the feel of pulling back the plunger on a pinball machine and launching it.<br/></p>\n<p>I'll probs add a windows Player into the .zip later, but not now. The saves will be in ~/.config/AGKApps/Punchball/media, and if they break, just delete them.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with AGK Classic. Is free on raspberry pi so if you got one lying around use it. Make sure to use a 32 bit pi because they don't got a 64 bit pi version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f7d8164adb0d80ef65684762455c2a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Munsterlandr"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
