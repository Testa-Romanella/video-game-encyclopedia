Try to get the yellow flying dots (pellets), while avoiding the lasers coming from the enemies. If you get a pellet, then you'll turn red, and is able to kill enemies by walking into them, for a while (one of the enemies requires five hits). There is also a store where you can buy upgrades. The counter in the top right tells you how many points you have, and the counter in the top middle tells you how many points you have gotten in the round. This is an entry for the curious jam. Enjoy this bad game.
