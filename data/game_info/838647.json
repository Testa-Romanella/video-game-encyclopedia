THIS IS INTENDED.</strong></p>\n<p>A cutsey pixel-art platformer where there are 2 rabbits, only one of which you control.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Ultra-simplistic platformer. Arrow keys, WASD. All there is to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Debugging your friend:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If your friend is stuck on a section, maybe try backtracking in order to guide them to the goal.\u00a0</li><li>If your friend is insistent on walking in/into a wall, head towards the side they are on, and try and coax them off of it. It never hurts to be kind about it.</li><li>If your friend is struggling with one of the timing sections, let them work it out. They'll usually get it sooner or later. If they are really stuck though, don't hesitate to give a hand.</li><li>If you are stuck, take a deep breath, let go of the jump key, do a little shift dance and patiently edge your way out of the corner. Let go of the stress and just enjoy your little adventure.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97e9371c68a9b11c9ca870ce9486ae52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KamikaziDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
