{"id": 700297, "slug": "rewritten-kat", "name": "Rewritten (Kat)", "name_original": "Rewritten (Kat)", "description": "<p>Rewritten is a storytelling game prototype\u00a0inspired by how stories are told through time. Too often in history, the story of a woman is told only where it concerns a man; we know these women as catalysts of war, objects of desire, cruel traitors, and more, but do we really know these women at all? Can we tell a story \u2014 or many stories \u2014 that doesn\u2019t reduce female characters to just the time they interact with men?</p>\n<p>\tIn Rewritten, players can play through three different personas: Medusa, Catherine of Aragon, and Scheherazade. Each of these characters has a story already told throughout history, but in the game players can choose the next option to learn more about the character, change history, and rewrite the story.\r\n</p>\n<p>Further development coming soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/295/2956db94d0bb5c122e8dc2066a96219f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
