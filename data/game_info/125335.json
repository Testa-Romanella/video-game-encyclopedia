It's all about balancing mass. If you run out of mass, you die. Everywhere you go, you leave a trail. This takes away from the mass, but going over your trail again takes no mass away. Pressing [grow] twice will make you split. This clone has one half of your mass. If it dies, you get transported back to your previous body. So, on the one hand, you want to have lots of clones so you stay alive longer, but on the other hand, the clones don't have a lot of mass and are therefore vulnerable.</p>\n<p>If I had a bigger level, the balancing would be much cooler, but trouble in other places made it so that I couldn't focus on that.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Made using Godot Engine<br/>Sprites designed by CodeTriangle using Piskel<br/>Code written and tested by CodeTriangle<br/>Logo cobbled together quickly by CodeTriangle<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SOURCE<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>http://github.com/CodeTriangle/glob</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fcc3cc07d7f4e58de87a6910355196e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CodeTriangle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
