You pick a card, your sled moves according to the selected card, the deck reshuffles and it's your opponents turn.</p>\n<p>Each card takes away or gives you provisions. Traveling cards give you the most distance, but spends provisions, while camp cards gives you the shortest distance but gives you provisions.</p><p>Each traveling card gives you random terrain and random weather. The better the terrain, the further you can go. The worse the weather, the more provisions you spend.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Let's take a look at examples of some cards:</em></p>\r\n\r\nTravel Card: Stormy weather over rocky terrain.<br/>This card gives you poor distance for a lot of provisions.\r\nTravel Card: Clear terrain in sunny weather.<br/>This card gives you good distance for less provisions.\r\nCamp Card: In cloudy weather.<br/>This card gives you provisions but short travel\r\n\r\n<p>Reach the pole before the other player reaches theirs but watch out to not spend all of your provisions!</p>\n<p>Made in Game Maker 2 for #igijam-1!</p>\n<p>Originally made with the beta version of Game Maker 2, I had some interesting development restrictions, such as limited amount of objects I was allowed to use. I managed to bypass some of the restrictions with tricks like reusing the same text object for all the texts.</p>\n<p>There's a chance I might create a physical card game based on the design of this game jam. It sort of depends on balancing projects with available time.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my friend \u00de\u00f3rir for lending me his laptop for the project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4d/d4d67b7f1bcf66e7eba16437a45d1dd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoiSigurdss"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
