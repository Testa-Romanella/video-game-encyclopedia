On a journey to find what is behind this phenomenon, you play as a little bird\u00a0in a coat who wishes to see just how far the tower climbs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Upon entering the tower you start on floor one in the lower-left corner of the room and on the opposite corner there is a staircase to the next floor. The bad architecture of the tower is immediately apparent as the floor is covered in holes. As you travel upwards be careful not to fall! It doesn\u2019t matter how much health you have, if you fall, that is game over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to just run to the stairs on each floor; your score is calculated via the amount of gold collected, so you are rewarded for exploring each floor rather than trying to get to the exit as fast as possible. So, you could hug the perimeter of the floor where there are fewer holes, but your score won\u2019t increase unless you venture into the middle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you traverse higher in the tower, more gold is likely to be found, but the number of slime enemies increases as well! The game ends when you meet your doom to either the slimes or accidentally fall through one of the holes in the floor. If a slime hits you don\u2019t worry! It's not an immediate game over like the holes. You start with 5 total hit points. The small slimes deal 1 damage, while the larger king slimes deal 2. So you can take up to 4 hits from the little guys, but only 2 from the big ones.</p>\n<p><em>Currently in development this is an endless tower, so there is no end. This is supposed to be a light-hearted arcade game, just to see how far up the tower you can go and try to beat your previous high score each time.\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the Arrow keys or WASD to move.</li><li>To pause the game press the pause button in the top-right corner or press the ESC key.</li><li>You can quit the game through the pause menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T16:29:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93d/93d67d0ee1e01a098b79f736a49377ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emily Penna"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
