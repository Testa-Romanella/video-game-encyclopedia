Every journey is randomly generated based on responses to a few questions. There are no traps or deadly things to harm you, but there are many objects that may stir up memories from your past. Some paths are bright and airy, some are dark and foreboding. So go forth, get lost, and be prepared to face whatever your mind dredges up as you experience a new kind of moving meditation.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 includes 34 unique artifacts, and the game keeps track of which ones the player has found.\u00a0 The on-screen display shows the number of artifacts collected in the current journey, as well as the number of unique artifacts collected across all journeys.\u00a0 Each journey includes 11 randomly placed (and randomly selected) artifacts, so it will require quite a few journeys to collect them all.<br/></p>\n<p>If enough people like this idea, then I am hoping to add a museum to view all the artifacts the player has collected, along with many more artifacts to collect.\u00a0 I also have several more ideas for different journey themes that I would like to implement.<br/></p>\n<p>This Tech Demo focuses on procedurally generated worlds and music that are influenced by player choices, and also on a multi-level menu system.\u00a0 It took about 35 hours to create, and is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept for a VR game I am making, but my beta testers thought it was rather fun.<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to the creators of these Assets for helping this rapidly evolve from idea to reality!\r\n  </p>\n<ul> <li>Dungeon Architect: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/dungeon-architect-53895\r\n  </li><li>Feel: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/feel-183370\r\n  </li><li>Gothic UI: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/gothic-ui-135882\r\n  </li><li>Low Poly Ultimate Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/low-poly-ultimate-pack-54733\r\n  </li><li>Character Movement      Fundamentals: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/character-movement-fundamentals-144966\r\n  </li><li>Flat Kit: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/flat-kit-toon-shading-and-water-143368\r\n  </li><li>Everloop: Nonlinear      Soundtrack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/everloop-nonlinear-soundtrack-45205\r\n  </li><li>POLYGON Dungeons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/polygon-dungeons-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-102677\r\n  </li><li>POLYGON Sci-Fi Space: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/polygon-sci-fi-space-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-138857\r\n  </li><li>Basic Motions: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/basic-motions-157744\r\n  </li><li>All Platforms Save: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/all-platforms-save-115960</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T17:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f493a8f82bc16be07378230e8b502f97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoddledSoftware"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
