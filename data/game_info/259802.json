He can&#39;t believe he&#39;ll get to work with the amazing beings.  He&#39;s been a temp worker for a while and hopes he can impress Professor Raiden so he&#39;ll have a permanent job. Voiced by Kiba Walker (Zoolaplex, Seiyuu Danshi).<br />\nThe interdimensional portal is the result of a lifetime of hard work and dedication by Professor Raiden.  He gave up on any chance of serious romance to focus 100% on his discoveries.  Voiced by Nathan Matthews (Yaoikuza, Tender Master).<br />\nArata has been Raiden&#39;s faithful assistant for years.  He considers Raiden his senpai...and wonders when he&#39;ll notice him. Voiced by Steve Warky Nunez (Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Heroes of Newerth)<br />\nHarsi came through the interdimensional portal the day after Saji arrived and seems to be looking for him. This rough and tough incubus is nothing but trouble! Voiced by Sean Chiplock (Full Service, Persona 5, Danganronpa V3, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild).<br />\nDevi came through the interdimensional portal with his leader Vald.  Little is known about the incubus, but he seems kind, warm, and gentle.  Voiced by Reece Bridger (Fare Thee Well, Bulletville).</p>\n<p>Saji came through the interdimensional portal a week after Vald and Devi arrived.  Though quiet and withdrawn it appears like he&#39;s running from someone.  Voiced by Julie Rei Goldstein (Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom, PlanetSide 2, Return of the Guitar Lord).<br />\nVald came through the interdimensional portal with his subordinate Devi.  He gives off the cool air of a born leader--or an evil general?  Voiced by Terrence Drye.<br />\nChiyoko\u2019s running the Professor&#39;s institute while he&#39;s stuck in quarantine.  Maybe he&#39;ll promote her to be the director one day.  Voiced by Lylse Weapon.<br />\nAlso featuring the voice of Michaela Laws (Seduce Me 2: The Demon Wars, War Clash), Cole Feuchter (Camp Buddy), Christopher Escalante (Dungeon Fighter Online, Anima: Gates of Memories), and Elsie Lovelock (The Letter, XOXO Droplets).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-21T07:46:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7b/e7bcdc5736dd146f4afdd70fa945f936.jpg", "website": "https://ypressgames.com/category/to-trust-an-incubus/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Studio Kosen", "Yamila Abraham", "ViviChibi", "Elle Rei", "ShinigamiKitty", "FairfaxLeasee", "Steve Nunez", "Le Perrugine"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Y Press Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
