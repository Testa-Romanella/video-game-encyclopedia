In such cases, it's usually due to some intentional human action with criminal implications. <br/>However, there are incidents where no leads can be found no matter how much investigation is conducted, events so enigmatic they're labeled as \"mysterious disappearances.\"<br/><br/>Enter the Paranormal Investigations Consortium, known as \"PIC,\" specializing in such supernatural phenomena investigations.<br/><br/>Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel.<br/>Rumors spread online about guests staying in this room suddenly vanishing. <br/>Police started investigating due to the frequency of reports, but found nothing. <br/>The scene resembled someone vanishing in an instant, leaving behind belongings and half-eaten meals. <br/>Seemingly devoid of clues, we, with our specialized knowledge and experience in paranormal phenomena, can assert confidently: \"Every supernatural phenomenon has a trigger.\"<br/><br/>Detailed examination of the times and circumstances of the disappearances revealed a pattern. <br/>It coincided with a night wedding in the hotel's event hall, accompanied by the playing of Bach's famous \"Air on the G String.\" <br/>Sending two investigators to stay under the same conditions in the room, we recorded startling events. <br/>One investigator, while asleep, vanished in an instant, leaving the other, who was awake, unaffected. <br/>Given that the room was originally a single occupancy, the lack of observers likely contributed to the mystery.<br/><br/>Further investigation revealed anomalies occurring only under identical conditions to the disappearances: magnetic disturbances, slight decreases in gravity, and the like. Our primary task became analyzing these phenomena and developing technologies to handle them.<br/><br/>One week after the investigator's disappearance,<br/>As we progressed in analyzing the phenomenon for rescue efforts, astonishingly, the missing investigator returned. <br/>When questioned about their whereabouts and return, they recounted:<br/><br/>\"It was like the hotel but not the hotel, somewhere else entirely. <br/>Elevators and corridors, rooms that wouldn't open, and strange occurrences. <br/>You'd think you were dead until you woke up in Room 1028. Initially unsure what to do, I noticed a pattern. <br/>It began with altering the number of a specific object in the elevator to descend a floor. Descending with the wrong number, finally reaching the first floor, I was enveloped in a blinding light... and found myself outside.\"<br/><br/><br/><strong>[This incident marks its tenth year this year]</strong><br/>For an occult enthusiast like me, this event left a profound impact. <br/>Subsequent analysis revealed the phenomenon's minimal danger. <br/>Those who went missing were typically found within two weeks at most. <br/>Today, Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel stands as a unique attraction. <br/>The hotel and PIC established a mutually beneficial relationship: the hotel providing full cooperation to PIC, while PIC ensures technological support and safety for the attraction. <br/>Though reservations were full for years, today is finally my turn. <br/>Heart pounding, thoughts entangled, body uncooperative, I still manage to prepare and leave home. <br/>My destination? Of course, Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T08:29:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd234dc50e58afbf6dce2a445baa790e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IDEA FRUITION"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IDEA FRUITION"], "esrb_rating": null}
