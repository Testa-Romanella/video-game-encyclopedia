You have a new job that involves moving boxes and starting other tasks that take time--sometimes a lot of it--to complete. <br/></p>\n<p>You can multitask and go work on other puzzles while you wait, or just save the game and come back later. Time continues to pass while you're not playing.</p>\r\nManage Your Resources Over Time\r\n<p>The company hired you to carefully manage your money and fuel while solving puzzles slowly over time to collect the time crystals for them. But as things begin to take even more time, you start to suspect there might be a dark secret behind the company's activities.</p>\r\nSteal the Time Crystals\r\n<p>In this <strong>Stealth Prologue</strong>, experience the retro stealth gameplay of Time Bandit for the first time! Try to sneak the time crystals out of your workplace to sell them for more money. The stakes are high: every crystal they catch you trying to steal is lost permanently.</p>\n<p>This prologue features a high score. How many crystals can you steal within 3 real-time days? You'll receive your high score if you manage to get to the end of the 3 days without getting caught and thrown in jail!<br/></p>\n\r\nEverything Is Affected by the Passage of Time\r\n<ul><li>The company's security guards and cameras are watching. But perhaps it's easier to get away with sneaking around at certain times of day...</li><li>Work shifts tied to the actual time of day that change the consequences of getting caught. If you're <strong>on shift</strong>, it's OK to be seen by guards, unless you're trying to steal a time crystal. If you're <strong>off shift</strong>, you definitely want to avoid being seen.</li><li>Keep an eye on your energy meter. It goes down slowly while you play,  and certain actions will deplete it more quickly. Swallow an energy pill  or get some good sleep back home at your apartment to fill it back up.</li><li>A story that unfolds slowly in real time over the course of days and weeks of playtime.</li><li>A real-time day-and-night cycle, location-based weather, and music that changes dynamically with the time of day.</li><li>Move boxes, grow trees, build bridges, and compact trash--and wait for them to finish</li></ul>\r\nA Story with a Dark Secret\r\n<p>You slowly learn that the company's extraordinarily wealthy CEO and shareholders plan to use the time crystals to t\u0335\u0358\u0344\u0360\u034c\u0324\u032a\u033b\u0359\u032da\u0338\u034c\u0352\u0300\u0306\u030c\u0350\u0309\u0328\u0347\u0347\u0331\u0319\u0355\u0359\u032ek\u0337\u035d\u0300\u035b\u0360\u0343\u030e\u035b\u0307\u035c\u0354\u0317\u035a\u0330\u0323\u0320\u031ce\u0336\u031a\u0340\u034c\u0339\u031e\u0333\u0331 \u0337\u0350\u0307\u0313\u0319\u0355\u0332\u0355c\u0336\u0358\u031a\u033f\u030b\u0356\u032d\u0333\u0318\u0349o\u0338\u030b\u0340\u0306\u0308\u035b\u0332\u0359\u032bn\u0336\u0313\u0307\u034et\u0334\u0307\u033f\u034c\u0307\u0326\u032f\u0319\u033b\u0327\u0319\u0355\u032er\u0337\u0357\u0307\u0326\u0327o\u0336\u030f\u0344\u0306\u0352\u0305\u031d\u0318\u0332\u0324\u034e\u0349\u0326l\u0334\u030d\u0305\u0311\u0326\u0339 \u0334\u0351\u0311\u0308\u0304\u0311\u030b\u030f\u0326\u032b\u0323\u0318\u035a\u033co\u0334\u035d\u033d\u030e\u0330\u0347\u033a\u0339\u0325\u0354f\u0335\u035d\u0317\u0333\u031f\u0355\u031c\u034d\u0316\u0324 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in order to m\u0334\u0305\u0310\u0314\u0306\u0303\u035d\u0349\u032c\u0320a\u0337\u0301\u0350\u0315\u0306\u034a\u034b\u0306\u0357\u032d\u0323\u0327\u0333\u0325k\u0334\u0303\u0306\u034b\u0304\u0339\u034d\u032b\u0339\u032e\u031de\u0337\u0300\u030d\u033c\u0355\u032f\u033b \u0336\u0310\u030c\u0306\u0358\u0305\u0324\u0326\u032ey\u0336\u035d\u0303\u0304\u030b\u033f\u0357\u0347\u035c\u0325\u0348o\u0338\u0305\u0351\u030b\u035d\u0316\u032b\u034d\u0345u\u0338\u0342\u0303\u032d \u0338\u0346\u0333\u0333\u0320\u032f\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u0334\u035d\u0315\u0350\u031a\u031b\u0344\u0354f\u0334\u0341\u0342\u0358\u0312\u0340\u030f\u0352\u0349\u032c\u032f\u0328o\u0336\u0302\u0309\u0351\u0304\u0325\u0316r\u0337\u0352\u0301\u0309\u0304\u0350\u0306\u033d\u0343\u0316\u0316\u0316\u0353\u0324\u0321 \u0335\u033e\u033f\u031e\u033c\u035c\u0345t\u0335\u0310\u0301\u0300\u0322\u0355\u0320\u032b\u0339\u032f\u0355\u0330h\u0337\u030f\u0306\u0311\u034d\u033a\u0339\u0348\u033a\u032d\u031e\u033ae\u0337\u0350\u0358\u0328\u032a\u031em\u0338\u030a\u0311\u0315\u0358\u0306\u0306\u0341\u034d\u0355 \u0334\u0308\u0311\u034b\u0301\u0314\u030e\u0332\u0353\u0353\u0329\u033c\u0359\u032b\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.</p>\n\n<p>In the full release of Part 1 of Time Bandit (coming soon on Steam and Itch.io!), you will uncover a dark but absurd conspiracy in lowpoly cutscenes and radio conversations inspired by retro cinematic games.
