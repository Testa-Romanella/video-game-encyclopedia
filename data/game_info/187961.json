There's a story and, depending on where you land, your character develops different characteristics.</p>\n<p>Two Players: Decide who's Player 1 and who's Player 2 and off you go. Less story elements here, just rolling the digital die.</p>\n\n<p>This is a first draft of the game. I plan to enhance the single player story/text, possibly add new features. Maybe even some kind of save game and achievement system. Comments and feedback definitely encouraged.</p>\n<p>(Update to make the mobile view of the game more friendly is coming imminently!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/5095681a2ba7cae51cda7a8ed11ecc52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonathanfournier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
