Sadly WebGL version seems to have completely broken sound... ;(</p>\n<p>It's a simple puzzle platformer controlled with directional keys and a Shift (to run).</p>\n<p>Your goal is to use unique properties of each character to help everyone escape each level.</p>\n<p>Good luck (in dealing with my first attempt at platformer movement)<br/></p>\n<p>P.S. Every asset and every script were made during the game jam, only external elements are the one provided by Unity like Cinemachine and PostProcessing (and fonts... free fonts were used but they were not provided by Unity). Music was made using beepbox.co<br/></p>\n<p>Also game had no refactorization or extensive testing so it might break easily. MacOS build was not tested at all due to hardware limitations (I simply don't own one :D), Linux build on the other hand failed to compile (and I was too lazy to work on it), and finally if WebGL version has no sound it's not my fault (I was not lazy in this department, I just failed).\u00a0If you encounter any problems write essay in the comments about them and their impact on your experience, how they changed your worldview and influenced future decision making. Hope it'll make your day just that 1-bit better.<br/></p>\n<p>Have a nice one!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abf/abf3e827f5fac687356137b9bf13a10e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["NoCultist"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
