You just need to find a decent parking spot and run to the interview site. Hopefully it all goes well... and hopefully you remember where you parked!</p>\n<p>This is a concept that arose organically during my experiments with a 3D \"chunk\" system for endless game environments. The parking garage generates procedurally and pseudorandomly using square chunks that populate their faces with prefabricated walls, floors, windows, doorways, and ramps. I'm continuing to improve this system and reporting on my progress on my blog at problemecium.blogspot.com alongside my other projects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:35:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/422f8fd498283c5e5c48a7d25bfdb910.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
