Sounds easy - you could say. But the game will force you to shoot, to shoot fast, thanks to the \"second healthbar\" that constantly decreases and can only be refilled by killing enemies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Shoot at the speed of light, but be clever with your position and you will be able to slay the terrifying beast, waiting for you in this ancient dungeon. Just don't forget to - always - Watch your aim!</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This was my first game jam where i participated in solo and this was a really stressful experience! Yep, all the assets, except the sound and music are made by me! I really wish i could make my own music for this game, but, unfortunately, i was running out of time, so i took all the music (and sounds) from some random sites.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 I hope you will enjoy the game an leave some feedback! Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c78a14c0f971b6d09397a7f399628445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kanya"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
