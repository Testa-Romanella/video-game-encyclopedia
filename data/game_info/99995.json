One combat operation includes 5 levels and 1 boss mission. The aircraft will lose altitude with each descent, so be cautious! The randomly placed bonuses on different building storeys might boost or hinder you during the bombardment. If you find such a Bonus crate, try to hit it before it's gone. If a bomb hits the Crate, you get one of the 10 bonuses.</p><p>Pay close attention to the bomb container level \u2013 you may run out of bombs at the worst possible moment! You'll get the <strong>Stars of Valor</strong> during the flight. Those are very important and aren't to be ignored. Stars bring you closer to victory! You may receive them for:</p><p>1 star \u2013 bring down 10 storeys without a single miss</p><p>2 stars \u2013 blow up all the storeys</p><p>3 stars \u2013 hit the General</p><p>The enemy <strong>General</strong> is always hiding in different buildings and noone knows where is going to hide next time. He's not waiting for a bomb to squash him and will most probably run away, so don't miss him!</p><p>Upon getting 3 stars for a combat flight operation you automatically get an <strong>Upgrade to the aircraft</strong> used in operation.</p><p>Obtaining Stars isn't mandatory but helps in the final Boss fight. Besides, you'll have to finish any level in the current mission, get 3 Stars and get ahold of a 1st aircraft upgrade \u2013 the Boss access key. You won't be able to reach the Boss without it. And the next level will remain blocked while you have no Stars earned yet.</p><p>Good luck on your missions, pilot! Have a steady aim, earn the Stars, defeat Bosses, get Achievements \u2013 it is all yours to have!</p><p><strong>! This is a free demo !</strong></p><p>In this demo you are going to find 5 combat flights and an attempt to fight the first boss, and also \u2013 due to your requests \u2013 you can destroy a gloomy sand city by piloting a seagull!<br/></p><p>Official page - http://fd.com.ua/en/new-projects/airstrike-hd</p><p>Please vote for Airstrike HD on Steam Greenlight !</p><p>Thanks a lot !</p><p>Fifth Dimension Company, 2016</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a61f26235bc812d0071d65b9110037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fifth Dimension Company"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
