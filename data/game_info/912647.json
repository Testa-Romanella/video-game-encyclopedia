I had an audio bug happen where the falling obstacles wont play any sound when they collide with the ground.\u00a0\u00a0Another bug thats happening is that the main menu screen wont put up first, or at all for that matter. The actual game music won't play either because its linked to the main menu screen being shown.\u00a0 I couldnt figure out how to fix these issues. I had fun making this for my very first game. Thanks for checking it out!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e91610ea101833d005e95976928d82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krevlas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
