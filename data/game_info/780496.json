I wanted my game to be based on Niffelheim, one of the 9 Norse realms, the realm of fog and storms. My game is more designed for people who have played games like Abzu or Journey, also those who enjoy Skyrim-like visuals.</p>\n\n<p>Headphones are highly recommended to get a more immersive feel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcd54a6f5dbd4179990dc18aac097ead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Noxoholic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
