You incarnate two wizard's souls who share the same body to reach the center of your destroyed tower. To achieve your goals, you should run through the debris of your old home and fight your old tools which came alive magically.</p>\n<p>In a run, you control one of the two avatars: the <strong>runner </strong>and the <strong>shooter</strong>, respectively represented by the <strong>wizard </strong>and the <strong>spirit</strong>. Each player is assigned a <strong>color</strong>. This color allows the magician to walk on the platforms with the same color and the spirit to shoot the enemies with the same color. You will have to <strong>change roles</strong> with your game partner between shooter and runner according to your environment. To reach the center of your blown-up home, you will have to communicate with your partner to be able to progress through the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>For the wizard :<ul><li>Press A to jump\r\n</li><li>Hold A to wall run\r\n</li><li>Use the left joystick to move right or left\r\n</li><li>Start Button to set pause\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>For the spirit :</li><ul><li>Right Trigger to shoot\r\n</li><li>Left shoulder button to swap bodies\r\n</li><li>Start Button to set pause\r\n</li></ul>\n</ul>\n<p>This project has been made by 4 students at Isart Digital :</p>\n<p>- Lenny Rabinne</p>\n<p>- Mateo Erbisti</p>\n<p>- Antoine Mordant</p>\n<p>- Bryan Bachelet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T09:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/211394d258b9f4765a77ad977d587d9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mateo_gp"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
