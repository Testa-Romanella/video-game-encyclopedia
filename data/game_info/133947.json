It's hard, dude. But actually sort of fair. Also, i tried to find a way to use a lives system without it being a total waste of time, and i actually think i almost did a good job of it.</p>\n<p>The funny thing is, i don't even know how it happened. Do you ever get that thing, where you have a sudden, unexplained burst of inspiration, and then the next thing you know, a week has passed and you have this thing that you don't know what to do with? No? Well i get that all the time. It's quite annoying, actually.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n<p>Really hard, fair(?) game that's like NES Castlevania if NES Castlevania wasn't all about killing things.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and BTW, if you're a total wuss who can't handle the old-school lives system, try inputting the konami code on the title screen. You whimp.</p>\n<p>And one last thing; The sounds for Midnight's laugh and scream were made by a Freesound.com user called 11linda.\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/1...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:31:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d37b9fea4b24ccf7f20d0613398f60e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lord Dragoneye"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
