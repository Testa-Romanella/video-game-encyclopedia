So be careful with that gun: the more you shoot now, the more bullets you face in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move and the 'Z' key to shoot. These keys can be remapped in the\u00a0<em>Options</em> menu (although there is a bug of function keys not showing up in the display, don't worry, they still work fine).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fonts:<ul><li>Potra by\u00a0Alejo Bergmann (alejobergmann@gmail.com)</li><li>Disolve by\u00a0Freddie Line</li></ul></li><li>Music<ul><li>Deep Blue by\u00a0\u00a92019 Joshua McLean (mrjoshuamclean.com) (mrjoshuamclean.com)\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:40:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2f20e769d0956c2b6b1655d098dcac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suitangi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
