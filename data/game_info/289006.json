Many rooms in the house won\u2019t open, and when her father Jugo is not around she\u2019s locked in her room with just her \"imaginary\" friend Bosco for company. She believes that her father\u2019s strict behavior is out of concern for her health, but one day she discovers something which changes her mind.\u00a0During her quest to find the main door key she learns that she has very little time to leave before it\u2019s too late\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>This title remember me something...</strong></p>\n<p>Toraware no Shoujo -Bluebird of Happiness- is a reboot of the famous/infamous Toraware no Shoujo - Caged Girl- released in 2015.</p>\n<p>We always regretted the fact that the delicate issue of abuse wasn\u2019t handled properly in the game, and this generated lot of criticism about our project. Another problem was the extremely broken English that ruined the overall gaming experience. Amazingly, even with all these issues and its very short and linear gameplay, the game became extremely popular. On YouTube you can find lots of gameplay in different languages, and we are now up to 25,000 downloads (and counting!). All this love has convinced us to give the story another shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please, don't judge it just for it predecessor,\u00a0give it a chance!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49e/49e04407b8a1f083c48f95eec6ab109f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uma Tenshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
