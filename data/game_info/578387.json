The biggest similarity would be to <strong>Super meat boy</strong> as it is equally as frustrating! It startet as \"Let's make a platformer\" and that's exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of a little robot that needs to find the key for it's house while aliens try to kill it. And so you jump and run through the 8 levels trying not to destroy your controller in rage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note that the speedrun timer is highly inacurate</strong> so if you want to know exactly how long you needed it wont be any good.</p>\n<p>Also <strong>the key is always to the left</strong> (except for stage 6)</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98702d383283047111a10794f596e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ENDOBLANCE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
