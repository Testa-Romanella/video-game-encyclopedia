I used Blender to create the character model and animations\u00a0and Unreal Engine for everything else. I used Unreal Marketplace assets to build the map with all of the other models\u00a0as well. The game is based on a randomly generated them of Deja Vu. This is captured in that you are trapped in a map with 4 seemingly identical rooms.\u00a0The goal is to find out how to escape. Here is a developer video to show that I\u00a0meet all of the assignment requirements.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b2799ba07e48b9f6b6edc151ad1e99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tbrooks3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
