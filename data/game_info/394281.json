Problem is, the moon isn't quite what we were told.\r\nThis is a title I came up with for the epic mega jam/, its sorta a play on words \"Cosmonaut\" and Catmonaut. This was my first game jam and I will say I\u00a0had an absolute BLAST. Doing something like this as a solo developer is tough and I'm sure there are a TON of issues but I'm very proud of the final product!\r\nThanks for playing and I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddc/ddc764a7cdadf5cfc9b4590e709d626a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkyReach"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
