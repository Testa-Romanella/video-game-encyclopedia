I created the game as part of the SHMUP Tutorial series on youtube created by Krystman of Lazy Devs fame.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Use arrow keys to move and X to fire and use Z to fire bombs when available. Collect more bombs to get a more powerful shot and collect slices of space pizza to regain lives. If you have max lives or bombs you will get ten bonus points instead!<br/></p><p>This game gets quite difficult but pickups are liberal enough so use those bombs and best of luck!<br/><br/>The enemy art in this game is from other users on the Lazy Devs Discord server and can be downloaded as part of the tutorial series. Credit for the awesome boss art goes to Krystman himself and the excellent boss fight music was created by his very talented chip tune chap Sebastian (I hope I am spelling that right!)<br/><br/>I highly recommend anyone who is interested go and start the series for themselves!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T14:09:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00acf4298d2abe8917167c3449a19320.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["K33"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
