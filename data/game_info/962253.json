The game will start directly when you join the game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you start the game you will have a set amount of energy that you can spend. Use it wisely! Because when you are out of energy you will need to upgrade your generator or upgrade the turrets. <br/>\r\nThe turrets in the game use different amounts of energy and that's why not all turrets are good to use in the start but great to use in the end. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe waves start easy but ramps up to harder faster enemies.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe strategy in the game is to know where and when to place different turrets and also know when it is time to upgrade the generator.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T04:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60c/60c1402ecd524134c5bdb1abaa1bcac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedOrb Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RedOrb Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
