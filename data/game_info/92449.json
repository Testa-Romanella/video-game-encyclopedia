Sadly, life and other issues got in the way and it couldn't be finished in time.</p><p>After a bit more work, the game is now in a playable state and corresponds more or less to what I had in mind for the jam, that is a narrative experience and a prototype for something bigger. It has bugs, gameplay flaws and narrative issues but I still hope you'll enjoy the unique feel.</p><p>The game is quite self explanatory (and the discovery of the game is part of itself) so just try it and see what you can do with it. I hope you enjoy!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Mouse: Look / Interact</p><p>WASD: Move</p><p>Tab: Inventory</p><p>Esc: Pause</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Renaud Despinois: Design, Story, Programming, Additionnal Art, Music, Sounds</p><p>Jonathan Romero Ruiz: Art, Animation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f98e7079f2bb08f9b8daf1114042c878.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Oddly Shaped Pixels"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
