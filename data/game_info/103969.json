You consider yourself to be the \"king of thieves\" and no one can doubt your stealth skills. One day, Ricko, your biggest rival and head of an enemy gang, challenges you in front of all your followers. This is something you cannot defy. You have to accept the challenge and successfully complete it for the sake of your reputation. Ricko must not win! And what is the challenge? Enter the cellar of Lord Amatar's house and steal his oldest, thus the most expensive, bottle of wine. A challenge that sounds easy and possibly would be, if only the owner of house had been someone else. Just knowing the name of the owner gives you goose bumps. But you are obliged to accept the challenge. Otherwise your name and your future as the \u201cking of thieves\" will be in danger.</p><p>Spellbind places an emphasis on storytelling and puzzle solving rather than impressive visuals and is easily playable by experienced and inexperienced adventure games fans.</p>\n<p>Features</p><ul>\n</ul><p>-Traditional fantasy setting.</p><p>-Classic adventure game feeling.</p><p>-Up to 12 different riddles and many other puzzles waiting to be solved.</p><p>-Simple point-and-click user interface.</p><p>-Over three hours of casual adventure gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f2285deb4f0590f7eb292e3b57eb5aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spider Key Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
