Play Minesweeper but in 3D in VR.</p><p>Supports Vive and Oculus controllers.</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Click on a cell, if it is not a mine, a number will appear. That number represents the number of mines that that particular space is touching. Touching applies in the x, y, and z axes, as well as diagonally. Use this information to deduce which cells must be mines and which are free.\u00a0 You may flag the mines for easier reference.\u00a0The goal is to clear all the free spaces without clicking on any mines. Do this as quickly as you can.</p>\n<p>You win when either: you clear every single open space or you correctly flag every mine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03f9fa1bbae180e64640207acd2eb987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mat_cook"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
