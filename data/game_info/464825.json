You have two attacks, both of which are randomly selected. The power meters at the bottom of the screen tell you how much power that attack will have when you activate it.</p><p>If a meter is filled, a random effect will be triggered, and the associated power will be switched with another.</p><p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Left Click: Use First Power</p>\n<p>Right Click: Use Second Power</p><p>POWERS:</p><p>Shield: Using this power makes you invincible</p><p>Lightning: You attack a nearby enemy, and if that enemy is close by another enemy, you damage that one too. Links up to three times.</p><p>Fire: All enemies within your radius take damage</p><p>Balls: Fire projectiles that bounce off surfaces once. Touching these will also kill you</p><p>Bomb: All enemies take damage. Using this automatically drains that power's charge</p><p>ENEMIES:</p><p>Blue: Will always move toward you</p><p>Purple: Spins around, firing a single bullet periodically</p><p>Yellow: Spins, firing a shotgun-like burst of bullets periodically</p><p>Red: Moves toward you. Once in range, will begin glowing, and eventually explode, damaging all within explosion radius.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9af9ff01c50bc655983b62438cab5ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EllenElzai"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
