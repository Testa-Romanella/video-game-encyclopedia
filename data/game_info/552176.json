My buddies and I are new to Unity and this was our first game jam! Although our game isn't perfect, we learned a lot of stuff along the way. This is\u00a0\"Snowy Treasure\". We didn't have time to polish everything the way we wanted but we gave it a good run. It's about an explorer searching for buried treasure on an island. You can explore the terrain and dig in different areas to find the treasure but be careful, the elements can destine you dead. Can you find the treasure?</p>\n\n<p>Main Character artwork done by:\u00a0Szadi art (https://szadiart.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Tiles done by: Stealthix (\u00a0https://stealthix.itch.io/rpg-nature-tileset)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:59:36", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["its_Ryebread"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
