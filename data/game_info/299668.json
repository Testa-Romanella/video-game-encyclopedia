The more candies you collect the better, because they can unlock special upgrades, more jumpers and other unknown worlds. <br/><br/>Here's what you'll encounter: <br/><br/>- Candy Magnet - this is a special item that will bring all candies to you for a certain amount of time. When you get the candy magnet, you'll be able to collect a lot more candies as usual. This special item can be upgraded as we speak and used at your advantage. <br/><br/>- Power Jump - this is the ability to jump much higher than usual. You'll be equipped with \"alien-like\" powers to boost jumps. This would happen only if you get the Power Jump artifact. <br/><br/>- You'll have more than 10 jumpers to choose from. Each would have special abilities others will not possess. Choose wisely.<br/><br/>- There are 3 worlds to choose from. Each has its own dangers and obstacles, but with enough courage and experience, you can master all three. <br/><br/>- Red dragons. They are your enemy. Stay away from them as much as possible.<br/><br/>You have the ability to show off on Facebook. You can post your best score and make friends envy you. It's your time now!
