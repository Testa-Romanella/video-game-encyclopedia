You can change the direction the snake moves, but you can't make it stop moving. Your objective is to eat the food blocks to gain points. Eating food will also increase the length of the snake by 1. However, should you collide with either yourself or a wall block, then it's game over.</p>\r\nTL;DR\r\n<p>Play snake, eat yellow food blocks. Every 10 seconds, yellow blocks remaining turn into gray wall blocks. Don't hit them or yourself or it's game over.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can play this with either Keyboard or a Gamepad.
