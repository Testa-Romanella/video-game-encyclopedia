Discover them!<br/>\r\nJust like the traditional minesweeper game, you can mark the sphere by right-click it or discover it with your left mouse bottom.<br/>\r\nWhen discovering a mine, the game will end. Otherwise, it will disappear if there's no mine around it, or show a number represents how many mines are around.<br/>\r\nYour target is to uncover all the sphere that doesn't contain a mine, while keep those with mines covered. Once you found a sphere contains a mine, mark it. After marking enough mines around a discovered number, you can safely uncover other spheres around. But if there's any flag that marked wrongly, mine will be waiting!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe control is really simple:<br/>\r\n+ WASD for basic movement<br/>\r\n+ C to move lower<br/>\r\n+ Space to move upper<br/>\r\nApproach a sphere, and you will notice it highlighted. Then:<br/>\r\n+ Left mouse bottom to discover it<br/>\r\n+ Right mouse bottom to mark it as mine<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can use the key Q to quit current game or quit the whole game easily. Esc do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nComparing with the traditional 2D Mine Sweeper game, the Mine Sweeper 3D definitely push the toughness to a new level. An experienced player can mark all the mines in a 10-mine game under 5 secs when playing the 2D version, but it's really hard to complete an 8-mine game in 5 mins playing the 3D version.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you really think you're an expert, the expert mode is here for you! Try it and move with caution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Mine Sweeper 3D game is made with Unreal Engine4, which provides epic graphics and full screen experience. You are playing the minesweeper game in a mountain area, with a house and a camp besides. Feel free to travel around, and back to game at whenever you want! You can also take a walk after winning a game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave Fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T02:44:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/35645d9e2ed8c487b4aa19c95806954e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flower Black"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Flower Black"], "esrb_rating": null}
