They never meet in person, however they can help each other to escape by solving puzzles.<br/>Effectively this game is a local coop game, where two players can control their own character, but you can play it alone.</p><p>This is my second game jam. I feel like I improved a lot since my first jam. I hope everyone will like the game, and remember <strong>stay safe</strong> and <strong>wash your hands</strong>.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ae/9ae4c6efad0f6095d2b7682717ba3eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Szivacs"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
