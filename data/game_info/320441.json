Create your mini-empire in the middle of the ocean, manage the economy, develop modules, make your rig better and achieve success! <br/><br/><br/>The world, however, can be cruel sometimes.<br/>Disasters, legendary monsters or random events - you will have to face this as a new director of the oil rig.<br/><br/><br/>Develop the platform and see how oil flows in the pipes, and loaded ships sail away. Count the money and enhance your oil rig to earn more money.  Buy new better ships, hire more employees, take care of the environment and start making even more money.<br/><br/>Face the Kraken, UFO or simple fires (on the oil rig nothing is simple tho). Take care of your crew and have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0f/f0f1f83ce09ee8419313d3d3d1242d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Dev Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games", "Gaming Factory"], "esrb_rating": null}
