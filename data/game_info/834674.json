You just can't wait\u00a0to spend time blissfully on the beach,\u00a0in a famous place called \"Fruit Heaven Chalet\", where you'll be able to feast on\u00a0your favorite fruit, the watermelon.</p>\n<p>But luck isn't on your side this time...\u00a0around Fruit Heaven Chalet, you find an infestation of Fire Spirits who, guided by their boss, have decided to ruin each villager's vacation by running\u00a0around and burning people.</p>\n<p>So what better way\u00a0to take revenge on these hot little creatures than by using your beloved watermelons as a weapon of mass destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Info</strong></p>\n<p>The genre of this game is similar to FPS Rogue-Like, so maybe it can give a little bit of motion sickness.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p><em>Eat Watermelon</em>: Restores HP, Adds Seed Projectiles in your mouth</p>\n<p><em>Shoot Seeds</em>: Use the Right Trigger to Shoot Seeds.</p>\n<p><em>Launch Watermelon</em>: Enemies hit by watermelons take big Damages.</p>\n<p><em>SuperWatermelon!</em>: Like classic Watermelons, it gives\u00a0HP if eaten, but MORE! If thrown to Enemies, it deals Damage but MORE!! And it also has AOE EFFECT!!!</p>\n<p>The game has 2 Levels + a Tutorial (at first, I thought of\u00a0creating 4 levels, but I didn't have enough time left sadly), and there are also mechanics where, if you pay with Gems dropped by enemies, you can Upgrade the power of Watermelons and Seeds, and the player will also be able to\u00a0Level Up.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy this game, and if you do, let me know! Have a nice summer and eat lots of Watermelons!</p>\n<p>This Game is tested on Oculus Quest Standalone, i couldn't test properly the PCVR version of the game, anyway is using the OpenXR plugin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/7127a5ae5f0273432c850483d8d49803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["TotallyNotDevs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
