The theme was \"Out of Control\". Your player randomly transforms every 10 seconds into one of three forms: a ball, a spring, and a weight; the ball behaves like a normal player. The spring launches in the direction of the mouse cursor; and the weight.. doesn't do much. The map will rotate around occasionally making getting to goal either really easy, or really hard.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:41:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78a74cb52fb84968927336bdac0cb360.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["sotrh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
