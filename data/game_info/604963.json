{"id": 604963, "slug": "towlr-sword", "name": "towlr (sword)", "name_original": "towlr (sword)", "description": "- THE ESSENTIALS -  \r\nA Towlr puzzle should prominently feature the iconic + symbol somewhere.  It usually has no purpose.  A Towlr puzzle must be a complete experience.  Graphics and Sound.  A Towlr puzzle should keep an error count, and upon completion share with the player how many tries it took to complete.  This is commonly associated with cake.  Contrary to Portal, cake does not lie in Towlr.  Cake is truth.  Cake is success.  \r\nA good Towlr puzzle should have an obvious solution (obvious once you realize it),  and shouldn't require twitch reflexes to complete.\r\n  \r\n- - - - - - - - - - THE TEN CLASSIC COMMANDMENTS  \r\n1. Towlr shall without fail display a + sign in the center of the screen at all times. This + shall have no purpose in gameplay. \r\n2. Towlr will not give the player any indication of what goals the player is trying to achieve. \r\n3. Towlr will display clearly and offensively when the player has failed, resetting to a default state. The preferred display is a blinding flash with awful noise. \r\n4. Towlr shall be in a web browser or a window, not fullscreen. \r\n5. Towlr will display the player's number of attempts in clear numerical form, preferably in an upper corner of the screen. \r\n6. Other than this number, Towlr will display only simple geometric shapes, preferably in horrid colors. \r\n7, Towlr will only output sounds that are grating and awful, and computerized. No recognizable sounds or speech. \r\n8. Towlr is a single display, no title screen and no multiple screens or scrolling. \r\n9. Towlr shall award cake to the player upon victory, clearly displaying the final number of attempts in the process. The cake and final total may be displayed visually or with text, and are exempt from commandments #1 and #5-8. \r\n10. There are no tricks in Towlr.  Towlr shall provide sufficient information to be completed in the context of play. A player who completes Towlr will smack their forehead and say \"Oh, of course that's what you do!\" at some point during gameplay, as opposed to \"There's no possible reason why that worked\".   \r\nTHE BILL OF DESIGNER'S RIGHTS  \r\n1. Towlr may accept input in mouse or keyboard form (or both).  Only input devices that are commonly available are permitted. \r\n2. You may name your Towlr in any reasonable fashion provided the word Towlr appears in the name, and the name is confusing and off-putting. \r\n3. Towlr may incorporate dexterity challenges in addition to puzzle-solving.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae0f20e5cb3eb226a2ebc4127c60ec1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cryptomnesic Softworks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
