It`s really more of a tech demo then a full game.</p>\n<p>But the good thing is that i spend so much time on a easily expandable dialouge system with multiple branches, that i now got a nice Asset for future Projects.</p>\n<p>So i will consider it a win XD.</p>\n\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>TALKER:</p>\n<p>Move Talker using the \"A\" and \"D\" button.</p>\n<p>If you get close to an NPC and it gets highlighted with yellow, this means you can start a conversation with them using the \"E\" button.</p>\n<p>On the left side you will be shown all possible awnsers you could give the NPC. Select them using \"1\", \"2\" or\u00a0 \"3\".</p>\n\n<p>PICKOMETER:</p>\n<p>The Pickometer represents the awareness of the NPC.</p>\n<p>It will increase the longer the conversation goes on.</p>\n<p>Good answers can lower the awareness, but bad answers increase it</p>\n\n<p>PICKER:</p>\n<p>Move Picker using the left and right arrow key.</p>\n<p>If you get close to a NPC that is currently talking to Talker, it will get highlighted red.</p>\n<p>This means you can start pickpocketing them using \"SpaceBar\".</p>\n<p>A new Window will show up where you reach into theyre pockets. Use up and down arrow to controll youre Hand.</p>\n<p>You have to get to the end of the pocket, touch the phone (it will be grabbed automatically) and then navigate back out.</p>\n<p>Hitting other things will slow you down and raise the awareness of the NPC.</p>\n<p>If awareness reches max, you will get cought and its Game Over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:42:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c3/8c3300e8bb963b526974abfc17b7ae20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cubzer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
