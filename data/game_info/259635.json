The rate at which we dump waste and sewage into our oceans of far too devastating (1.2 trillion gallons in the U.S. per year). Marine pollution is a global issue we should be more aware of because even when it starts off as a small local problem it can affect the entire world as the pollution spreads from one ocean to another. This doesn\u2019t just effect aquatic life either, it effects the environment as a whole and can throw off the balance of our entire ecosystem. If we don\u2019t stay aware of pollution or if we let it continue to get worse eventually it could cause the death of many non-aquatic species including our own.</p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Research</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Content Research:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>-Pollution\r\n  <ul><li>Aquatic life is in danger\r\n  </li><li>Industrial waste goes into water 1.2trillion gallons of sewage\r\n  </li><li>70% of wastes are dumped   </li><li>80% of sewage in developing countries is untreated- rivers, lakes, costal areas\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>-Defined by seametrics.com:\r\n  <ul><li><strong>Water pollution</strong>\u00a0is the\u00a0<strong>contamination</strong>\u00a0of\u00a0<strong>water</strong>\u00a0bodies (e.g. lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater).

A very few showed no response or became inactive. After a few hours the hyperactivity was replaced by quiescence or normal activity although periods of abnormal activity might reoccur at a later time.\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p>Hall, J., Arnold, J., Waller, W., &amp; Cairns, J.

Lake Michigan once produced numerous white-fish. The number of whitefish has been greatly reduced. The reasons are not only over-catch but also the covering up of breeding bottoms with a large amount of sawdust and other rubbish which makes the spawning grounds useless. Some of this bottom can never be recovered, at least, not for a long time.\u201d\r\n  </p>\n<p>Shelford, V. (1918).
