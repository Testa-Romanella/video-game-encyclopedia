Land with your spaceship on a barren piece of rock, deploy automated bots and start building your mining empire. You will explore and prospect asteroids as well as planets throughout the entire Solar system. Extract resources and process them in complex factory production lines of your design.<h3>Take advantage of a fully destructible 3D environment</h3>Every asteroid body is a 3D object. The 3rd dimension adds another level of complexity to your factory designs. Asteroid mass can be removed or deployed as needed. If a mine gets depleted, it leaves a hole in the ground.<h3>Take care of your colonists</h3>Build a colony base and infrastructure to support colonists. Make sure you meet all its inhabitants' needs.<br/><h3>Manage resources and energy</h3>Machines in factories are always hungry for materials and power. Build conveyor belts, pipes and power lines to secure steady supply of resources.<br/><h3>Trade for missing resources</h3>You can trade for any missing resources if needed.<h3>Play campaign scenarios or in procedurally generated worlds</h3>You can play various campaign scenarios or create a random world and start building your colony.<h3>Create your own content</h3>The game comes with a fully featured campaign and mission editor.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-26T03:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4d511469e922136ebc289e73d97f38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jan Zizka"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Jan Zizka"], "esrb_rating": null}
