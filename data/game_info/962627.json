Master the art of unicycling and venture across breakneck flat surfaces, minimal inclines, and pocketbook-sized crates!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo I hear seesaws, jumps and catapults? You'll have that down in no time. Well, maybe a tad later. Or maybe shortly after. Oh dear, please don't hate us.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLook forward to 90 hand-designed levels, unlockable characters, and a game that's hard to master, but also very hard to put down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBreak a leg!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T05:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e6acf6d79c621761b22684588ce004f.jpg", "website": "https://www.roflcopter.ink/en/unimime/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roflcopter Ink"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Roflcopter Ink"], "esrb_rating": null}
