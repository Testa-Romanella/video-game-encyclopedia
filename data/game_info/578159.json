Because it changes everything!</strong><br/><h3>More Than Your Regular Shooter</h3><br/>You start with your personal vehicle on a wild starting block with 49 online opponents.<br/>You have to steal the jammer that will prevent the government agency to kill you to be the only one to end up free and breathing.<br/>GangV has a strong emphasis on high-speed chases in the middle of the traffic featuring many different cars but also planes, boats, and helicopters!<br/>The game will require your shooter skills as well as your pilot skills for you to be victorious!<br/>But be careful, you start with just a gun and your own car may be quickly spotted by your opponents!<br/><br/><h3>Steal Your Loot</h3><br/>You\u2019ll have to Steal money and equipment from civilians that will call law enforcement on you.<br/><br/>The game has a strong focus on the risk/reward principle.
