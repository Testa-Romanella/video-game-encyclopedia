It's me, Adderick, with this new 2D blocky game. I got the inspiration from classic puzzle games like Tetris but tried to do something different. The result is a game where you must place as many pieces as you can on a grid while you try not to get stuck. Every time you complete a row or a column, you'll get some extra space to keep playing.</p>\n<p>The game is and will always be 100% FREE. I did this just for fun and to improve my developing skills, and have no intention of making any\u00a0 economical benefit from it.</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment and tell your opinion! Feedback is always more than welcome :)</p>\r\nCurrent features\r\n<p>The game, while simple, includes some fun features that make it more interesting, such as:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Random piece generation:\u00a0</strong> the squares appearance and color, and the rotation and shape of the piece itself are chosen randomly from a bunch of premade lists.</li><li><strong>Simple animations</strong><strong> and movements\u00a0</strong> for squares and pieces, that make the game look less static.</li><li>Some\u00a0 <strong>sound effects\u00a0 </strong>for piece placement, line removing and others.</li><li><strong>High score</strong>\u00a0 to keep track of your best game ;)</li></ul>\r\nFuture features\r\n<p>I'm also planning to add some extra features in the future:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Difficulty levels\u00a0</strong><strong> </strong>according the piece generation. The more variety and size, the more difficult.</li><li><strong>New gameplay mechanics\u00a0</strong><strong> </strong>to remove squares in fun ways.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75a/75a1cd8040ec0faecfaceb9ac6bf7711.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adderick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
