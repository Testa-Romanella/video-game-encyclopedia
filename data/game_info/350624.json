Your choice determines your range of movement, initial turns, and starting trinket. Unlock additional heroes through victories.<h3>Explore your path</h3><br/>Each adventure is dynamic. Choose between branching paths, visit shops, face down difficult boss puzzles, and encounter mysterious strangers.<h3>Discover powerful, rule-breaking trinkets</h3><br/>Uncover and purchase valuable trinkets on your journey. Find obscure synergies between trinkets to bend or even break the rules of the game.<h3>Play at your pace</h3><br/>Puzzles are turn-based without a timer. Save up your turns for more difficult challenges or to purchase rare, expensive trinkets. Running low on turns and nearing defeat? Find a collector and pawn off your trinkets for more turns. Finish a run in a single session, save it for later, or abandon it for new odds.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af06ecffa160fcc155815693701d87e.jpg", "website": "https://happygrumps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Glenn LaBarre"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Glenn LaBarre"], "esrb_rating": null}
