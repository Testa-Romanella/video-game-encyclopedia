My idea for this was Tony Hawk\u2019s meets Time Crisis - an on-rails shooter where you had to balance at the same time. The Tony Hawk\u2019s grinding mechanic worked out pretty well, but the fact that (by definition) you have to be constantly moving meant I had to dial back on the rail shooter side a little. Sadly, features that didn\u2019t quite make it in include a nice AI system with swarming and building avoidance that I had to scrap to finish everything else in time - it\u2019s still quite a challenge though!\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything made in 72hrs. Written in C# in Unity, music in FL Studio, graphics in Cinema 4D + Substance Painter\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e81/e812c48013ab3f8830f856243a07449b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Rhys C"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
