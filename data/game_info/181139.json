That's my main focus for now while game is still in development. I\u00a0would most welcome feedbacks of players so I could work/fix further, as well as desktop/laptop configurations this game is played/tested on. Because of optimization issues.... I work alone on this game so I don't have any other machine to test it on except the one I am working on... thank you in advance... Of course screenshots and gameplay video are welcome as well, I will be adding them to the game page if provided...</p><p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>-W or Up arrow = Up<br/>-S or Down arrow = Down<br/>-A or Left arrow = Left<br/>-D or Right arrow = Right</p>\n<p>-Left or Right CTRL = Primary fire<br/>-Space bar = Secondary fire<br/>-Left or Right ALT = Special fire</p>\n<p>Gamepad:</p>\n<p>-Left analog = Movement<br/>-X or Face bottom button = Primary fire<br/>-O or Face right button = Secondary fire<br/>-Square or Face left button = Special fire</p>\n<p>Pick ups:<br/>-B = Bonus score<br/>-H = Health<br/>-L = Extra life<br/>-P = Weapon power up<br/>-S = Shield (doesn't work at the moment)<br/>-W = Special weapon (fire)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/6249ba6640ae2f5efae47a6d27fd8192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delusional"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
