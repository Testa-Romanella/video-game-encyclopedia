Items purchased usually appear in the Shop Pit located in front of the player unless they are a direct buff.<br/><br/><strong>Spell System</strong><br/>The spell system in Stick Adventures: Wizard Madness works based on the shop, the player first buys a spell scroll from the shop and then activates the scroll by clicking on it whilst it's in the Shop Pit. You can only have one spell at a time. <br/><br/><strong>Random Reward System</strong><br/>The player will be rewarded throughout the game via the Random Reward System. This system is triggered via killing mobs to build up a behind the scenes counter, once this counter is at maximum capacity the player will be greeted with the Reward System.<br/><br/><strong>Clothing System</strong><br/>The clothing system in Stick Adventures: Wizard Madness is very straight forward, the player has a large selection of clothing to choose from using the arrow keys on the keyboard. You do not have to pay for these clothes with in game currency all of it is available from the start.<br/><br/><strong>Save System</strong><br/>Every time a new level starts the game automatically saves locally on your hard drive, please remember you only have one save file so if you start a new game it will erase the old one.
