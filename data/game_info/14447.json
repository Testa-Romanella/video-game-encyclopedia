{"id": 14447, "slug": "poly-bridge", "name": "Poly Bridge", "name_original": "Poly Bridge", "description": "<p>Poly Bridge is an indie puzzle building-based game developed by Dry Cactus.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In Poly Bridge, the players have to build a bridge across a river. The bridge has to be strong enough for several vehicles to pass it, let alone the bridge has to hold its own weight.</p>\n<p>The game does not disable physics after the player is finished with building up the bridge, as each vehicle present in the game has its own weight and length, so the player-built structure has to be adaptive in some cases. For example, long vehicles, such as cargo trucks, will not be able to ride on steep constructions, so the bridge has to adjust itself based on the weight of the vehicle. </p>\n<p>There are also several obstacles for the player-built bridges present in the game, as sometimes a boat can spawn on the level and try to swim under the bridge. Storms are also a vital part of the gameplay, as the players have to also take into the amount the power of wind and adjust their creation as well.</p>\n<p>The main catch of the game is that the players do not have unlimited resources, so they will have to make the best out the things at hand. Several types of materials are present in the game with each material having a certain amount of strength. The river gets wider and wider as the player progresses through the game, as well as the number of vehicles that have to pass the bridge for level completion.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T00:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2ac/2ac6f80402afe5afddcebb8d8b0780c4.jpeg", "website": "http://www.drycactus.com/", "rating": 3.48, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 95, "owned": 1701, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 128, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 190, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 190, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "PC", "iOS", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dry Cactus"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dry Cactus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
