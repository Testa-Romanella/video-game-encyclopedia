Ready your weapons. Get behind that wall. SHOOT. ... AND RUN!!<br/><br/><strong>Short Description: </strong><br/><ul><li>Use attacks and skills: Use different characters with different attacks and skills! <br/><br/></li><li>Dodge: Skillfully evade, block or explode enemies' attacks before they reach you. <br/><br/></li><li>Recruit Allies: Don't fight alone! Allies will help you when you need the most!<br/><br/></li><li>Interact with the environment: Sometimes the best solution is just to return whatever they throw at you.</li></ul><br/><strong>Story:</strong><br/>After years of battle, the Tree of Eternity was damaged by a big attack from the Demon Lord, at the cost of his own (resurrectable) life.<br/>Still, the Undead and other chaos creatures are here believing they can give the final blow.<br/>Other living races, watching how the Tree of Eternity is damaged, are trying to capture the fortress, believing they can do a better job on defending the Tree than the current defenders.<br/>You, the Eternal Protector, are here to prove all of them are wrong.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay: </strong><br/><ul><li> The Eternity Protectors is a 20 minutes session Hero Defense. You play as a single Protector, shooting arrows and summoning magic to banish all creatures trying to invade the Eternity Fortress.<br/></li><li> There are many Protectors with different skills, which you unlock by successfully finishing a session with a certain Protector.<br/></li><li> In every match, your Protector becomes stronger by using their skills and defeating bosses.<br/></li><li> To defeat the bosses, you have to first defeat their Summons, while dodging their attacks, and protecting the Fortress Barrier.<br/></li><li> You can interact with the environment by putting trees on fire, shooting at enemies projectiles, throwing bombs back, etc.<br/></li><li> The game contains a short controls tutorial, but no text anywhere.

As a lone Indie developer, I greatly appreciate any feedback. (Link to the Discord down below)<br/><br/><strong>Developer Message:</strong><br/>Hello, I am called Sao, and am the sole developer of Eternity Protectors, my first project. I like to call myself an Indie Developer, since today.<br/>This is my first project, coming from a no-budget condition. All the assets either came with the engine, are free assets found on the internet, or are made by me. Please check the Community Hub for links to the free assets webpages. Many thanks for all free assets makers, this game wouldn't be the same without your kindness.<br/>I believe this \"Hero Defense\" type of game is very unexplored. I don't know if there are not enough people interested in it, but since I myself love it, I made this my first game.<br/>As a lone, first time developer, I gratefully appreciate your interest in my small game.<br/>Hope you survive;<br/>Sao.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T02:32:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a89fba53f2a19ee4f7a21f2f222a35e8.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/vB9M5SKQxu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Underway Gaming Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Underway Gaming Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
