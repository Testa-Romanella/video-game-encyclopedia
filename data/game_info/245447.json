{"id": 245447, "slug": "dog-board-game", "name": "Dog Board Game", "name_original": "Dog Board Game", "description": "Dog is a popular board game with cards. Your goal is to get all your and your partner's marbles into the target area before your opponents do.<br/><br/>In each round you first receive a handful of cards. You have to give one of your cards with your partner, and receive one of his cards. Cards that you play advance your marble. A marble that lands exactly on another marble sends it home. Special cards speed up your moves, by exchanging marble positions, going backwards, or splitting advances over several marbles. When you are done with your own marbles, you have to help your partner, as you can only win together.<br/><br/>Dog for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch lets you play on boards of variable size, and offers a variety of bot players with different characters and strength that you can select as partners or adversaries. In addition we offer the following rule variants:<br/><br/>- Canadian Seven: A Seven may be split among all of a team's marbles, including own and partner marbles. Such splits are available during the entire game and not just when all own marbles have reached the target area. This enables more complex moves.<br/><br/>- Joker cannot win: A Joker may not be used for the final move to enter a team's last marble and win the game. This prolongs the game and improves the trailing team's chances to win.<br/><br/>Variants may be selected separately or in combination.<br/><br/>The complexity of the game literally explodes with the Canadian 7 split rule. Millions of different moves are possible in some situations. We had to rebuild almost everything to ensure that even in such cases you can select every possible move without delay, and that our bot players can analyze and compare every single move. We have therefore decided to offer these variants as in-app purchases.<br/><br/>Invite friends to a multiplayer game, or find other players on the Internet! The players see your board and play their cards and marbles on their iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. Your devices communicate easily over the Internet via Game Center, or locally (no registrations needed) via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network. The app supplies bot players on empty game seats, so you can finally play with your friends even if you are missing a third or fourth player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:32:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf845d2677539c651c9f8cb137af91d_T68pV0X.jpg", "website": "http://dog.valuefromsoftware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Value from Software"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Value from Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
