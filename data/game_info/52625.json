It was licensed to Gottlieb in the United States. The game is a vertical scrolling shooter, with a third-person perspective like Radar Scope. It follows in the tradition of space-themed shooting-galleries such as Space Invaders and Galaga. Juno First, however, is notable for its frenetic gameplay (like Defender and Xevious).</p>\n<p>Juno First was ported to the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit by Greg Hiscott and published by Datasoft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9f3c45ee168f8a4e03d9036c72aa7b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 8-bit", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Konami", "Gottlieb"], "esrb_rating": null}
