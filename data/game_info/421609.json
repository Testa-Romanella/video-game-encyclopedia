A few nights ago I\u00a0was having trouble sleeping and I\u00a0remembered this game. I\u00a0played it a bit and\u00a0it helped me calm down. The next day I decided that I would finish the game and share it with the public.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These are pretty stressful and uncertain times, but I hope this game is as helpful for you as it is to me and is a comforting experience.</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear what you think of the game. And if\u00a0you want to say hi\u00a0feel free to reach out on Twitter @SodaDrinkerPro.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Will</p>\n<p>Note: this game is not a substitute for seeing a doctor or therapist.
