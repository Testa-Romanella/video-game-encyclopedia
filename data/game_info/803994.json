Help her in her quest for survival, but beware of the trash (turtles don't really like eating trash). <br/></p>\n<p>Any feedback or comment is welcome, as it will help me improve not only my programming and artistic skills (I made some of the sprites), but also my game designing skills :D<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T19:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d57a292ab5a87008bcd33b1f5f11c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Nickname064"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
