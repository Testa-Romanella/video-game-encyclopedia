{"id": 203360, "slug": "ether-wars", "name": "Ether Wars", "name_original": "Ether Wars", "description": "<p>Ether Wars is an addictive arcade game that will test your anticipation and coordination skills. Its main feature is the radial aiming game mechanic that consists on rotating your ship around the rim of a circle, with the objective to destroy the blob of ether at the center. This blob will only be vulnerable when the gaps on the rotating shields that protect it align, clearing the way for your shot. New challenges will appear as you progress, to test your abilities. Are you up for the challenge?</p><p>Ether Wars is a very simple game to play, which only requires a device with Android 2.3 (GINGERBREAD) or higher.</p><p>The objective of the game is to destroy the blob of ether that is at the center of the circle around which the player rotates. There are only three possible interactions: rotate clockwise, rotate counter clockwise, and shoot. In each level, the blob of ether will be guarded by one or two rotating shields that protect it. These shields will have one, two, or three gaps that will make the blob vulnerable. The aim of the game is to shoot, inwards, through the gaps in the shields so that the bullet reaches the blob and destroys it. As the player progresses through the levels, new challenges will appear, such as: partially invisible shields, portals, bullet speed modifiers, and gap shields. Apart from the mentioned challenges, an increment on the difficulty of the levels will also occur to make the game more challenging.</p><p>The mentioned game mechanic is shared between the three game modes that Ether Wars has. All of them share the objective of destroying the blob of ether at the center with the difference of the limited resource each of them has:</p><ul><li>Unlimited Game Mode: In this game mode, the player will have 10 bullets to achieve the highest level possible. After each level, the minimum amount of bullets to complete the level will be given back to the player and the time to complete the level will be reset to one minute. The game will end when there are no more available bullets.</li><li>Time Attack: This game mode will give the player 5 minutes that won't reset after each level but, to compensate for this limited time, the amount of bullets given at the beginning of each level will reset to 10. The game will end when the timer reaches 0.</li><li>PVP: For this game mode an internet connection will be needed, since, up to 6 players, will compete with the same rules that apply for Unlimited. In each round, the same level will be played by everyone before a new one is created. The game will end when a player runs out of bullets.</li></ul><p>Ether Wars has 20 unlockable achievements and three leaderboards: One for the Unlimited game mode, another for the Time Attack mode, and the last one for the amount of levels completed without missing a shot.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd46838e5a7243ca68da0d56364922f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TMGAM3S"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
