Each night Manuel will run around on a randomly generated map using his shovel to smash the ever growing number of Undead back into the grave and prohibit the Undead from attending the mash.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Story: Manuel, an ordinary graveyard worker, has found himself under the threat of the rising dead. He must use his elite groundskeeper training along with his trusty shovel, Maria, to put the dead back in the ground and make sure they stay that way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame Play Highlights:<br/>\r\n\u2022 SNES-Era action game (Whack-a-Undead)<br/>\r\n\u2022 D-Pad + 2 Button like controls (Arrows/WASD + X and Z)<br/>\r\n\u2022 Randomly generated Maps<br/>\r\n\u2022 Randomized enemy Spawns<br/>\r\n\u2022 SNES-Era on pick-up Power-Ups<br/>\r\n\u2022 A story mode with cut scenes<br/>\r\n\u2022 An endless mode for an endurance challenge<br/>\r\n\u2022 Mouse Based UI<br/>\r\n\u2022 Tower Defense like Health system vs. Player Health Bar<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOther Important Information:<br/>\r\n\u2022 Graveyard Smash was successfully KickStarted last November<br/>\r\n\u2022 Graveyard Smash is ready for immediate distribution.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Graveyard Smash was developed in Unity3d and is available on multiple platforms.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/194/194f6bc9308bfb1d3bfe8ba3bd89652c.jpg", "website": "http://threedayweekend.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 67}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Four Mans Games L.L.C.", "Samuel Strick"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Four Mans Games L.L.C.", "Samuel Strick"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
