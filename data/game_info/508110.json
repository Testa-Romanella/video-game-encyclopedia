With the house all to yourself it might sound like fun and games, but if you don't find the special keys and defeat Godo then he might just catch you first. And above all, don't forget to watch your tongue!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was made over the summer using Unreal Engine 4. Feedback is appreciated and we hope you enjoy Quite Good's first game!<br/>\r\nFollow @FlamiingPickle on Twitter for updates on Quiet Godo and future projects!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b76e0aec87cd255af24f84fcfdf375f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quite Good"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Quite Good"], "esrb_rating": null}
