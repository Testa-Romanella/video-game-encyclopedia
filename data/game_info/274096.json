Patrolling the icy wastes you come across a camp of people, and due to your natural charisma soon become the leader. Take charge in this life or death situation, utilising special individuals skills in order to survive. But you'll have to sacrifice others in order for the whole colony to survive, who will you pick? Will this freeze ever end, and if it does will you and your colonists be there to see it?</p>\n<p>This is our 5th entry into Ludum Dare, and we may have been a bit over ambitious with the scope of the game and what we wanted to achieve. What we have now is a great base to build off, and to make an actual game from, but we hope you enjoy what we managed to make in the 3 days! Things like the build menu and scavenging we would of built more on if we had the time, however this is definitely something we want to work on more in the future so things like that will be hopefully be built up then.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e54ea4fbb5616d424c44175e13c271d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JaGTeK Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
