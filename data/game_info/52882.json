{"id": 52882, "slug": "dodonpachi", "name": "DoDonPachi", "name_original": "DoDonPachi", "description": "<p>DoDonPachi (\u6012\u9996\u9818\u8702, &quot;Angry Leader Bee&quot;, also an onomatopoeia of gunfire) is a vertically scrolling manic shooter arcade game developed by Cave and published by Atlus in 1997. It was the second game developed by Cave, and the sixth on Cave&#39;s first generation arcade hardware. As with its predecessor DonPachi, the title is both a Japanese term for expressing the sound of gunfire, and a term that relates to bees (here it means &quot;angry leader bee&quot;). The sequel to this game is DoDonPachi II, which was made by a different developer. The original developer later released its own sequel, DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-26T23:36:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0ab/0abc09c9700ed0216922908e42ec3d9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 397, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["CAVE"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
