Everything was made from scratch by two year-long rocket game enthusiasts :o)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI also hope, you enjoy the soundtrack as much as I do. All melodies are composed by none other than Mr.Lou, who apart from being the creator of IndieGameMusic, is also one of the best digital music composers of my time (and who happens to be my brother as well ;o).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnyway. Enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNemiz.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5da27d7aefac3aa84b42e19d23ca9b.jpg", "website": "http://www.gamesbynemiz.com/games/another-rocket-game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games By Nemiz"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Games By Nemiz"], "esrb_rating": null}
