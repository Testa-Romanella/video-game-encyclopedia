(I'm surprised as well)\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>(The first world needs skill, the second one needs cunning. ;) )</em></p>\n<p><strong>Sadly I couldn't fulfill as much as I wanted to. Couldn't even finish the \"story\".\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>(But I had plans. Hint: name of the game)\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>## What I tried to achieve:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3 full world, with 3 very different\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>mechanics</strong>, (the 3rd is already complete, but doesn't have a world: \"ghost form\"),</p>\n<p><strong>art styles</strong>,\u00a0 (both visually and audio-wise)</p>\n<p>and <strong>feelings</strong>.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>## Ps.:</strong></p>\n<p>In this game I wanted to try out how much have I learned since my first (LD41) game jam.</p>\n<p>For example I learned about basic visual arts and music. Hurray :)</p>\n<p>So now I can proudly say that this game is 100% made by me.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in my future projects, post mortems, etc, follow me on LD, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc, etc (links here:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/users/tudvari\u00a0)</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for reading. :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/593/5939bec364759641a4ef933ba65e39f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tudvari"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
