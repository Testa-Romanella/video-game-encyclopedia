I paused it for now, but it has a nice procedural level generator I thought I might share.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interesting features:</p>\n<ul><li>Islands get generated in the background, put into a queue\u00a0and spawned whenever you get to a new island.\u00a0</li><li>Size of the island changes dynamically based on workload (how many finished islands are in the queue)</li><li>The queue is sorted on a calculated fitness value of the island, when spawning, it always chooses the best island available</li><li>The paths connect all bridges, npcs and keys,\u00a0</li><li>Also voronoi cells bc why not.</li></ul>\n<p>Gameplay is very basic, You have to do some tasks to unlock a bridge like collect keys or kill orcs, might also be impossible at some point sry about that.
