You play as a dog who's trapped in a forgotten pet game and wants to escape to see their owner again. This is just a prototype made in 1 week for my Game Production II class. This game got past greenlight and a beta version will be released at the end of the semester.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions/Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Your goal is to figure out the puzzle to be able to escape the room.</em></p>\n<ul><li><em>WASD - Move around</em></li><li><em>1, 2, 3, 4 - Move between camera views (movement is kind of backwards in other camera modes just fyi)</em></li><li><em>Up Arrow - Pick up an item</em></li><li><em>Down Arrow - Drop an item</em></li><li><em>Space - Jump</em></li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>(SPOILERS)</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>How to Beat the Level:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Pick up the plank, and drop it right over the tub. Then grab the ball and drop it right over the plank. Climb up the platforms and jump on top of the plank. This will cause the ball to hit the pipe and break it. Walk under the falling water. The door will open and you can escape!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T08:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7c/a7c92eec6f5a73b33af1bc8a7e541515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Minoqi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
