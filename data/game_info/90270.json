But little did he know, that at three in the morning on Tuesdays, The Hash Slinging Slasher comes back to wreak his horrible vengeance. You must gather all your things and escape the Krusty Krab before he kills you with his rusty spatula hand.</p>\n<p>I've been working on Dracula's Castle a little too much to the point where I feel like I've blown a fuse inside my brain. So I decided to take a break and work on one of my old abandoned projects, 3:00 AM at The Krusty Krab. It's kind of a short game depending if you know what to do and when to do your objectives at the right time. And no, this is nothing like Five Night at Freddy's if that's what you're thinking. ;D<br/></p>\n<p>Wanna support me to make this a small side job?
