{"id": 669554, "slug": "toot-n-loot", "name": "Toot n Loot", "name_original": "Toot n Loot", "description": "<p>Hey! Thanks for trying out the Toot n Loot demo! I got this far into the development process before realizing that maybe \"this isn't a thing.\" Regardless, I'm sharing it here while I move onto another project. That said, here's how you play Toot n Loot:</p>\n<p>Movement: WASD or arrow keys</p>\n<p>Toot/drum/bagpipe: space bar or LMB</p>\n<p>Switch characters: SHIFT or RMB</p>\n<p>I recommend the Mac or Windows version over HTML5. If you use HTML5 be sure to use Full Screen mode.</p>\n<p>YOU are a horn tooter of the peasant rebellion army. You cannot fight yourself so you are in charge of rallying your boys into the battle. As you are thrust onto the battle field, play your horn to have your highlighted troops follow you. As enemies fall in battle they'll drop sacks of cash. Try to pick them up before those pesky ravens swoop in! Move your troops around to kill all the king's troops, collect as much cash as you can, and then return to your village to hire more troops for the peasant uprising!</p>\n<p>In the shop you can recruit more spearmen, knights, and some additions to your band! While the bagpiper can't move your own troops, they will gain the ire of enemies who will prioritize attacking your band. Drummers also can't move your troops, but they give your own troops temporary greater strength! You can recruit up to 5 members into your band, and you are able to switch between them in the middle of the battle. Should your lead band member go down you will automatically switch to the next member up.</p>\n<p>As I said before, I'm probably leaving the game at this point to move onto different things. Alas, I had witches and wizards 70% completed, and I definitely wanted a swamp ogre that you could turn to your side with enough soothing tooting.</p>\n\n<p>Glitch thread:</p><p>- You can ignore that initial error about \"thick\". HTML5 has an issue with shaders.</p>\n<p>-HTML5 version has a few more glitches than the OS X and Windows versions, which I recommend over HTML5.</p>\n<p>- Victory/Game Over text disappearing too soon.</p>\n<p>- OS X / Windows versions highlight players you can influence. HTML5 version will have a circle under the players.</p>\n<p>- Shop text formatting goes wonky after Level 1.</p>\n<p>- One time I\u00a0had an enemy continually dying and dropping unlimited cash. I\u00a0never figured out what caused it, so maybe you'll get lucky and find it?</p>\n<p>- Sprite tears at the edge of maps</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:34:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/7595b3a86d6577ca7dc04acc865c3f9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["MayorMcFrumples"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
