There's not much to do, no enemies to kill or puzzles to solve. You can just look around, interact with the things around you and take screenshots.<br/></p>\n<p>Every once in a while, though, a paper boat will come sailing and stop in front of your dock, carrying a message for you, written by a stranger. Maybe it's a kind word of encouragement, or somebody emptying their worries into the void.</p>\n<p>Good thing is that you can also send a message in your own paper boat, and let it sail for a stranger to read.</p>\n<p>When you need a small break from reality, you can just hang around on the dock, watch the day go by and read messages from strangers.</p>\n<p>The concept for the game is nothing new; you can find another examples of the mechanic in The Things We Lost In The Flood and in Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to), which greatly expands and improves upon the concept. <strong>Paper Boats\u00a0</strong>is just my own, simple\u00a0take on the genre and an excuse for me to release something interactive, albeit small.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0Looking around in a serene lake environment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Capturing high-resultion screenshots.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Receiving anonymous messages from strangers.<br/></p>\r\n\u00a0 Sending anonymous messages to strangers.<br/>\n<p> \u00a0 <strong>Mouse\u00a0</strong>to look around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Left click</strong> to interact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Right click</strong> to zoom in.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>P</strong> to take a screenshot.<br/></p>\n<p>You can view your screenshots through the options menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I don't possess a way to thoroughly playtest the Mac and Linux builds so I can't promise they'll be working perfectly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00ad88066f99660568964ab59b84f881.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Harry Alisavakis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
