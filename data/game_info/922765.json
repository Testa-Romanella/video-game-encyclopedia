Would you describe yourself as\u00a0a connoisseur of mazes and labyrinths? Perhaps you have\u00a0an odd fascination with the long lore of mazes, of\u00a0myths of decrepit\u00a0Greek labyrinths filled with\u00a0Minotaur, or the myriad maze patterns discovered\u00a0across the world in archeological curiosities.\u00a0\u00a0Do you laugh haughtily at the facile mazes sometimes printed on the back of newspapers, secretly hoping for more, more complexity, more <em>mystery</em>? If so, then you are like me, an appreciator of mazes, and someone\u00a0of impeccable reason, refined taste,\u00a0deep intellect, and more than likely are good-looking too.\u00a0For to have recognized the secret lure of mazes and labyrinths you could be nothing less. You understand plainly that to solve a maze makes you <em>better</em>. Yes...better at solving hard things, better patience, better memory, just <em>better...</em> <br/><br/>And before you here, I have found a <em>better</em> maze too, one sure to test the mightiest of wills. It is wide! It is deep!\u00a0It is also tall! It is confounding!\u00a0It is BIG! It full of mystery too, cryptic messages, lost travelers, and\u00a0<em>otherworldly</em> beings.\u00a0 So,\u00a0gird your loins, tighten your belt, keep your wits about you, and enter this maze which has devoured men and minds. Solve it no matter how long it takes or how much it pains you because remember that solving mazes makes\u00a0you a\u00a0<em>better</em> person<em>, </em>better than your friends, better than your family, better than all those around you!\"\r\n\n<p>Is what the final note of your professor stated before setting out on an archeological expedition to a supposed ancient labyrinth\u00a0structure\u00a0never to return. He went somewhere unreachable by roads and avoided by the local populous, and now the college has tasked you with tracking him down and finding the lost professor. However, finding some old coot may be the last of your worries as now\u00a0you may be focused solely on getting out of the dizzying labyrinth alive!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Explore an enormous\u00a0maze, which includes 3d sections,\u00a0for all its secrets.</li><li>Find a way to escape inside the maze, the desert behind you is too vast to turn back.</li><li>Dodge dangerous obstacles.</li><li>Make notes in your handy journal to help map the maze.</li><li>Will you find out the fate of the professor?</li><li>Will you leave the maze empty handed?</li><li>More importantly, can you avoid a brutal\u00a0death?</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Designer/Developer/SFX/Artist:<br/>Bruugle</p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>NextToBlue</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/next-to-blue\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Disclaimer.
