You play as a young girl, playing in the puddles on a rainy day, when you discover something extraordinary! <br/><br/>Hint: Stand in the last puddle. <br/><br/>Because of working weekends, I had a limited amount of time to put this together, but it was well worth it. I surprised myself by how much I could create! <br/><br/>I used Phaser (phaser.io), Notepad++, Gimp, MSpaint, and Tiled to create this game. I hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da4/da4969a6acbdf106833bed893a97a425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lonewookie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
