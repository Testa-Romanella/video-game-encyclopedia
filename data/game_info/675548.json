As your ship is old, barely designed for combat and extremely <strong>unstable</strong>, your parts will <strong>fall off</strong> after a while. Thankfully, you can replace them by <strong>salvaging new parts</strong> from the enemies you destroy!<br/>But how well will you manage to do that in the <strong>heat of combat</strong>?!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be sure to think about how you build yourself up as unbalanced weight will make movement harder. Having guns on every side may make killing enemies a cakewalk, but comes at the sacrifice of extra speed. In this game you constantly have to make decisions and <strong>deal with what you\u2019ve been given</strong>!</p>\n<p>In addition to providing mobility and offensive capabilities, extra parts will also take hits for you. This is important as your core is quite vulnerable. Three hits and you're out!</p>\n<p>And some parts ...just look pretty. <strong>Dress your plane up</strong> for multiplied score!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>jm2k - coding</li><li>happyhead - art</li><li>fuyucchi - design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67c5a5f9d9df94126ee877db19af98e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HappyHead", "jm2k"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
