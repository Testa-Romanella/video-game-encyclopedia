Been quite busy with other projects. In Retro Snake you simply use the directional arrows to turn your snake trying to collect food to grow, speed up and get points. The default game mode is 'endless' in which if you reach the edge of the screen you will simply loop to the opposite edge. This can be changed in the settings to 'traditional' in which there is a wall around the edge of the screen which you must avoid. As always, all tips, suggestions and feedback is welcomed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/4626a5c172b86abe8b2422d862353948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Menacer20"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
