The goal of the game is to let snow cover as much area in the city as possible, before the snow fuel (or time) runs out.\u00a0The inspiration of the character is from one of my favorite cartoon character\u2014Kaito Kuroba in Detective Conan.</p>\n<p>The scene of the game is in Edinburgh, I modeled it like an island in the air, to make it more magical. The buildings are generated using OpenStreetMap API, they have almost the same position and height as the realistic world has, while don\u2019t have much detail.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17a/17a66e154a53f1fcfbe69b96c65222e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["kyy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
