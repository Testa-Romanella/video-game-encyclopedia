The longer you hold the flag, the more points to get. By reaching 16k points you win.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p>- Up to 4 vs 4 local multiplayer.</p>\n<p>- Bullets ricochet with almost anything. Some materials have a greater chance of absorbing the bullets.\u00a0Bullets also ricochet against each other.</p>\n<p>- For weapons that carry a magazine, when you reload it you also discard the bullets left in the clip, so you should be careful to keep in mind how many bullets you have left at all times.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Controls are a little weird right now because I had to fit 4 players in a single keyboard and also it was made to map those keys to real joysticks with joy2key</p>\n<p>- ENTER (connects a new player in sequence: player 1, then 2, then 3 and finally 4).</p>\n<p>Player #1</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD</li><li>Reload: R</li><li>Shoot: E</li><li>Greande: Q</li><li>Strafe: Left-Shift</li></ul>\n<p>Player #2</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: NUMPAD_5/1/2/3</li><li>Reload: NUMPAD_4</li><li>Shoot: NUMPAD_7</li><li>Greande: NUMPAD_9</li><li>Strafe: NUMPAD_6</li></ul>\n<p>Player #3</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: YGHJ</li><li>Reload: O</li><li>Shoot: I\u00a0</li><li>Greande: U</li><li>Strafe: P</li></ul>\n<p>Player #4</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: Arrows\u00a0</li><li>Reload: HOME</li><li>Shoot: INSERT</li><li>Greande: END</li><li>Strafe: CONTROL_RIGHT</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fb/0fbcb3b0b576e9878d0ef2571fd13d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Paul"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
