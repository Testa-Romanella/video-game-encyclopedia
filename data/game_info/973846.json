Also, the core of this project was made in 8 weeks so there are likely multiple bugs.<h3>FAQ</h3><strong>Why are the minimum requirements so high?</strong><br/>I am only able to test on my computer so I only checked on that system. The game will probably run with lower specs but I can not confirm that it will work.<br/><br/><strong>What do I do if the interactions break?</strong><br/>This can usually be fixed if you walk away then back towards whatever you were trying to interact with. If that still doesn't work, you need to throw away whatever you are holding and try again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T07:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebae463d70afde8bd11027f40d7bbda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Barlevy"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Ethan Barlevy"], "esrb_rating": null}
