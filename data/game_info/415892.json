{"id": 415892, "slug": "random-mini-trail", "name": "Random Mini Trail", "name_original": "Random Mini Trail", "description": "<p>This is a randomized and short/simplified form of the classic Oregon Trail game, where events happen at random rather than predetermined. It is based on a calculator reimagination of Oregon Trail I made previously.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get to Oregon on your ox-drawn wagon without losing all your health or oxen. Along the way you will pass by 9 other landmarks where you could stock up on supplies.</p>\n<p>This is in essence somewhat like a kind of digital single-player card game where a random event might or might not happen every step of the way. In your journey, you will encounter hazards such as diseases, accidents, thieves, storms, and more, which will affect your food supply, oxen, and health. At regular points, you will be able to buy more supplies for your party, or sell some of yours. To survive to Oregon, you'll need good luck and decent management of your resources, in order to have enough oxen and food to last till then. It's advised to buy resources when they are cheap, and to resell them when the opportunity arises to sell them at a higher price.<br/></p>\n<p>I beat the classic Oregon Trail the first 2 times I played it and the events seemed like they played out in exactly the same way, so I wanted to make a version with randomized events. To live up to its apparent \"difficult\" fame, the calculator game I made based on the Oregon Trail was made to be difficult to beat, with the score being based on how far you reached out of the 10 landmarks. This is a PC \"port\" of the calculator game. In some aspects it is more lenient than the calculator game, but in other aspects it is more difficult. The REMIX mode is closer to the calculator version, but expanded, as the calculator was too limited to put in everything I wanted to. The music in this game is arranged by me. Game made by Tangent. Based on the Oregon Trail for the Apple ][, with minor influences from Taipan, also on the Apple ][.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e17d5aaffe26995fb32d53361b44007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
