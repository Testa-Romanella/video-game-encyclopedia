{"id": 362405, "slug": "supercruise", "name": "SUPERCRUISE", "name_original": "SUPERCRUISE", "description": "<p>How to play:</p>\n<ul><li>The plane follows the mouse cursor.</li><li>\u00a0Left-click to shoot.</li><li>The gun will overheat if you shoot too much.</li></ul>\n<p>A simple game I originally made for a class. Some people thought it was good and told me to upload it, so this is it. I am not currently actively developing it anymore and am making other games instead, but if this has promise, I will revisit this. In that respect, it might be more of a prototype than a proper release I guess.</p>\n<p>Things I would add/fix if I were to revisit:</p>\n<ul><li>Make it possible to change the resolution and full screen</li><li>Make it playable in Mac, Linux, and Web Browser. I do not think mobile can be done nicely despite the simplicity of the game.</li><li>Gameplay-wise, maybe add more enemies and weapons or something. I wanted to add missiles, but I made it for a class pretty close to the deadline so I cut some things out.</li><li>Some UI improvements.</li><li>Improve the audio loudness. Make it adjustable. I think as it is now, some UI sound effects are too loud and the music is too quiet.</li><li>Global leaderboard.</li><li>Maybe I could expand the game in another direction.</li></ul>\n\n<p>I did all the code and art. I am not an artist. If the art looks like bad MS Paint drawings, that is because that is exactly what it is. <br/></p>\n<p>The screenshots are not flattering and the game looks far better in motion. It might look a bit weird due to the screen shake. The video is a better representative of the game.<br/><br/>This was written using C++ and OpenFrameworks. The audio was not mine. The music during gameplay is the Afterburner II theme song, which I did not make. The other sound effects are taken from Soniss's free GDC soundpacks.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T03:06:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/56723bd1e4bca64568a257636025b1d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Awcmon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
