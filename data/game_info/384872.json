In turn, they were likely inspired by\u00a0Line Rider. Comic Combat\u00a0differentiates itself from these games by making the lines physics based. However, during development I discovered that\u00a0Crayon Physics Deluxe also does this.</p>\n<p>The battlefield ambience was made by\u00a0TKhelkar.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 28 hours</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/9252cbf3aab0df9755da2688149e9ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
