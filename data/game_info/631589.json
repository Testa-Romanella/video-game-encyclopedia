Let's not talk about\u00a0the elephant in the room that is the fact that I completely ignored the jam's (optional) theme \"The Elephant in the Room\".</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a fairly straightforward extension of standard sokoban so I could really focus on level/puzzle design for this jam.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Many thanks to Zachary Barbanell, Corey Hardt and Mender Berri for playtesting.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with PuzzleScript by increpare. (Though specifically with my fork which makes working with perspective sprites a little easier.)</p>\n<p>Uses the Resurrect 64 Palette by Kerrie Lake. (I was weak and added one more colour to make the pits pop a little more.)</p>\n<p>The source code is available on\u00a0GitHub.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c57e6e6e6bcf710abf3d8dd82690392a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Menderbug"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
