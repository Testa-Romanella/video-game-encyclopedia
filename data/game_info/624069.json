You play as a little plant crab trying to escape a botanical garden.</p>\n<p>Learned a lot while making it! Also means there's lot of bugs and it might not be all that intuitive to play. The camera jumps around a lot, I used Cinemachine, but wasn't really sure how to use it. I had lots of fun making the shader, models and animations though! Hope you still enjoy!</p>\n<p>Music is by Kevin Macleod (of course), SFX from HSH Sound Library. Assets, Textures, Code and Shader made by me, based on tutorials and of course what I learned at Uni.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T10:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5f8de47e704e9d1ab4abfa81f85e007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["roboreptil"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
