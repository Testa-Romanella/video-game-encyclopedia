In this interactive game your lights will take over control and determine your overall game play experience. Pay attention to the state of the light(s) in your room, while tapping your screen to make the ball jump. Keep jumping and navigate through a series of spinning obstacles. And here it comes: you can only pass obstacles matching the color or brightness of your Philips Hue light. And be aware that your lights can change their state unexpectedly!<br/><br/>PLAY WITH LIGHT<br/>For the ultimate light-controlled gaming experience, it is required to have a Philips Hue bridge and at least one light connected to this bridge. It can be a color light or a dimmable white light, since the game has multiple play modes. Note that this color jump game can also be played without any lights, although it is less fun of course.<br/><br/>HOW TO SETUP<br/>A simple three-step onboarding procedure will help you to connect your Philips Hue lights to the game:<br/>- Step 1 - First, your Hue bridge has to be found. You need to make sure your Hue bridge is on the same WiFi network as the phone/device you\u2019ll use this app.<br/>- Step 2 - As soon as your Philips Hue bridge is detected, you need to connect it to the app by pressing the big button on the Hue bridge. <br/>- Step 3 - In this last step the app will come up with a list of all your Hue lights. You can select the lights you want to include in the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Color jump is a simple but addictive click game about color and patience. The goal of the game is to bounce a small ball through a series of moving obstacles. Keep tapping your screen to make the ball jump. Pass as many obstacles as possible and go as high as you can. You\u2019ll get points each time the ball passes an obstacle. The right timing is essential in \u2018Color Jump\u2019, because hitting the wrong color will end the game. Your Philips Hue lights will determine which color you can touch. When you play without lights, the color of the ball will indicate this.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/01935fbfabb97e39aad2f32baa15fb83_Ej3kspQ.jpg", "website": "http://wienelware.nl/?a=megajump", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lidwien Veugen"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Lidwien Veugen"], "esrb_rating": null}
