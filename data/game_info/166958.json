Why no one had seen this before remains a mystery, but one thing is clear: There was no turning back, dog soccer was the new craze.</p>\n<p>At first the major leagues and associations fought it, banning dogs from playing at the highest level. This turned out to be counterproductive, as minor leagues which allowed dogs soon overtook them in audience share and revenue.</p>\n<p>After a few short years, the ban was lifted and dogs were pervasive at all levels. Their ball sense, stamina, obedience, and team spirit eclipsed even the greatest of human players.</p>\n<p>A generation later, only dogs remain on the field. Bred to be even faster, stronger, and cuter, dog soccer is played and watched all over the world.</p>\n<p>As the manager of one of the best teams in the world, can you lead them to victory in the World Pup?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Footnote:</strong> <br/></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>If you beat the game, you unlock the secret<strong> Golden Retriever</strong> breed for all future game sessions!<br/></em></li></ul>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Credits\r\n(in order of contribution)\r\n<ul><li>Love<ul><li>Project Management</li><li>UI Programming</li><li>UI Design</li><li>Animation Programming</li></ul><ul><li>Rigging</li></ul><ul><li>Animating</li><li>Gameplay Programming</li></ul></li><li>Kukrunkarmaskin<ul><li>Gameplay Programming</li><li>Physics Programming</li><li>Graphics Programming</li><li>AI Programming</li></ul><ul><li>UI Programming</li><li>UI Design</li></ul></li><li>Emily<ul><li>3D Environment Art</li><li>3D Character Art</li><li>Animating</li><li>Rigging</li></ul></li><li>DanielD\r\n<ul><li>Music Composing</li><li>Sound Engineering</li></ul></li><li>Mihai Zetta<ul><li>Voice Acting</li></ul></li></ul>\r\n\r\nThis game was made with the Unreal Engine", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e2/5e23eea1b4dcdf5a6390138917875337.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jfaw_love", "LudvigLoven"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
