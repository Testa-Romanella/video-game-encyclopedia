Finally, you can associate a specific value or text (including emoji) to each face for complete customisation.<br/>During use, you can also hide some of the dice in the group, to roll only a part of them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T08:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/7637aa4378172df79e4867123b8756c8.jpg", "website": "https://www.bonamsoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
