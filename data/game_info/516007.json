Our game is a 2D pixel horror shooter where you shoot enemies while your dog Buddy follows you around. You have some enemies popping out of vents, some holding shields, and its up to you to make sure you don't get hit--or else you die and Buddy gets left alone.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely in black and white with 3 distinct enemies. If you get hit once, you respawn at the beginning of the map. But poor Buddy, having to see you die over and over again :( so try to react fast to save him from the heart ache.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/280/280019c6e45f53197d0c8b0d09c58e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mycatfish", "PumpShotty64"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
