{"id": 736313, "slug": "high-noon-drifter", "name": "High Noon Drifter", "name_original": "High Noon Drifter", "description": "<p>High Noon Drifter is a GZDoom weaponset where you play as a gunslinger that&#39;s stuck around for a little longer than the end of the wild west era. The weapons and overall tone is relatively low-tech, complimenting more natural-style mapsets for roaming around castles, ruins, and other assorted gothic setpieces. You make use of some ordinary guns that any joe could scrounge up, a handful of antiquated pieces, and a couple dark artifacts in a quest to dispense frontier justice to an ethereal threat.<br />\nIf you&#39;ve been craving a &quot;Weird West&quot; sort of weaponset, or even more of an adventurer-type rather than a soldier using military tech, hopefully this&#39;ll be up your alley.</p>\n<p>High Noon Drifter is also a simple and gimmick-less weaponset, probably the most straightforward mod I&#39;ve made yet--you pick up the guns, hit the fire button, they go bang and kill the demons.<br />\nA lot of gameplay mods nowadays come with a sort of a big crazy gimmick or a whole bunch of over-the-top weapons with lots of intricate functions. And that ain&#39;t a bad thing! But with this, I wanted to re-study the basics of what makes a gun fun to use, sticking with just the basic weapon types and then making them N E A T.<br />\nThis also provided me with an opportunity to familiarize myself with the intricacies of ZScript and Anonymous Functions before using them on a certain bigger project, because Lord knows both of those provide a lot of fun and laughs.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:<br />\n- Works in Doom, Doom 2, TNT: Evilution, Plutonia, Heretic, and Hexen! Well, and Chex Quest and Harmony.<br />\n- An idiot&#39;s first attempts at ZScript, with slowly more integration and usage over time!<br />\n- A complete weaponset with 10 (technically 11) different weapons to play with!<br />\n- A whole bunch of new and original graphics!<br />\n- All Doom/Doom 2 items and weapons have been replaced!<br />\n- Compatibility with most Boom and ZDoom mapsets!<br />\n- Monsters are un-touched, allowing people to load with their monster packs or gore systems of choice, or for custom monsters in maps to not break horribly!<br />\n- A bunch of cvars to customize your gameplay experience how you want!<br />\n- A unique, never-before-seen-in-Doom &quot;Hat System&quot; that keeps track of whether you&#39;re wearing your hat or not and adjusts accordingly!<br />\n- Compatible in multiplayer! I think? I mean, I haven&#39;t tried it, but some friends tell me it works, so...<br />\n- A dedicated &quot;crash the game&quot; button, just hit Mission Objectives!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d9265561774c7e9dab9d6f62fae25260.jpg", "website": "https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=57098", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
