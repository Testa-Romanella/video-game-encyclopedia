Instead, you may think this as a fairly old, early demonstration version for showing the general idea and vibes of <strong>interactive diorama</strong> type of game I am aiming to achieve...!!<br/></em>\n\r\nThings worth noting:\r\n<ul><li>This original version was meant to be a <strong>tiny micro-diorama  that would be entered and exited at any time</strong> with the main point of the  game being walking around and interacting given the <em><strong>advent calendar-esque</strong></em> nature of the bundle -- So there is no set ending  or objectives in this version.</li><li>This version of game features only one small \"area\" for user to explore and one hub area. In comparison, the current yet-to-be released build has <strong><em>2 main areas, 2 misc. areas, prologue and 2 endings. (with some changes to the main 'mall' area as well!)<br/></em></strong></li><li>This version does not have any fancy details, nor many other interactible elements that current build offers. Namely, this version lacks the <strong>'portrait graphics' and gibberish sound effects</strong> that was <strong>later implemented in the current build</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>Before I go about doing my own business -- Have some sneak-peek image(s) for the current build. <strong>(They're not in this version, but it's yet to come..!)</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Have fun and take care,<br/>ZIK.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T09:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237c0f9cc278f3878412ec85ab15cae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zik"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
