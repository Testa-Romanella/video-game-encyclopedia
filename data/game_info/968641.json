These are no ordinary woods, however, and in these woods, Noel has befriended the spirits of the woods. The Wind, Lake, and Stone are just a few of their best friends. Stone, the oldest spirit of nature, told them once that nature only appears to the youngest humans, and that one day they'd no longer be able to see nature the same way. Thirteen years is all they get with these friends.<br/><br/>Every winter, it's Stone's job to explain to Winter that the season is over and it's time to leave.
