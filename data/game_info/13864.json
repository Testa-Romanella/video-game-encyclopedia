Save has apostrophes for a reason... <br/>\r\nFire will kill you. Don't touch fire. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you hug all the trees, and save all the humans?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec7ff037ac8dd7d89d004bf40b772448.jpg", "website": "https://reddit.com/r/phanomgames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phanom Games", "Machineman1357"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phanom Games", "Machineman1357"], "esrb_rating": null}
