You just can't seem to remember what had happened before. Your body aches and you notice that you somehow became entangled in your seat belt. This\u00a0is where your adventure begins, involving a dark secret in a deserted\u00a0ghost town...<br/></p>\n<p>\"The Dark Secret of Calming Creek\" is a new visual text adventure with a modern take. It is\u00a0inspired by classic (horror) text adventures that were once quite popular in the eighties (like \"Castle of Terror\"), but also\u00a0by modern text-based\u00a0games including: \"Unhallowed\" and\u00a0\u00a0\"Stories Untold\".</p>\n<p>It is played like a true classic text adventure;\u00a0by typing in brief commands, typically existing of at least one verb and a noun, followed by pressing the \"Enter\" key. But like the more recent text adventures, you cannot really die in this game, so you don't have to worry about starting all over again or\u00a0saving your game after each new discovery. Also, the game can\u00a0 always be completed at\u00a0 any point, regardless of your actions and decisions. There is also more than just one ending.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Script, design, programming and testing: Manuel van der Avoird</p>\n<p>Additional testing: Bimbarlade</p>\n<p>Typewriter sounds: Pakasit21 (at freesound.org)</p>\n<p>Font types: \"HauntOAE\" by Brian J.
