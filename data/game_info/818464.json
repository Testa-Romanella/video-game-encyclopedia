In our game you control Zooba and your task is to reach the end of the level, while dodging enemy attacks and destroying them by rolling the dice. However, it's not all that easy. When you roll the dice, you trigger a random event that both helps you and makes it even harder. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this game's release is unstable and only first level works correctly</p>\n<p>We will fix existing issues after game jam is over!</p>\r\nLEARNING TO PLAY\r\n<ul><li> - use the move character\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0- press to crawl into the hole and\u00a0finish the level</li><li>to roll dice, press <strong>LBM</strong>, aim and then release it</li><li>roll of the die indicates the strangth of the buff or debuff</li><li>dodge opponents' attacks and dice to avoid taking damage</li><li>ENJOY</li></ul>\r\nBUFF AND DEBUFF\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0(+HP)</strong> =\u00a0Add health to the player</li><li><strong>\u00a0(+HP)</strong>\u00a0=\u00a0Take away a player's health\u00a0</li><li><strong>\u00a0(+Enemy)</strong>\u00a0= Spawn new enemies to the level</li><li>\u00a0<strong>(-Enemy)</strong>\u00a0=\u00a0Kill a certain number of opponents on the level</li><li>\u00a0<strong>(Shield)</strong>\u00a0=\u00a0Protect the player with a magic shield</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:33:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4ee96121183dcec9a9b612043cfafb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Astroship"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
