Scientists have made a big mistake causing all robots to explode after a certain amount of time. Use the items given to you to kill all the robots and as little humans as possible (even Johnny should be allowed to live, right?)</em><br/></p>\n<p>Kill all the robots to proceed to the next level!<br/><br/><strong>How it fits the theme:\u00a0</strong>The scientist have messed up and need to destroy their robots, their hard work, to survive. Which makes it so you need to let your robots die to proceed. And that's how it's failure to proceed! A bit more abstract maybe, but still very much the thought behind it!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Left Mouse Button and Right Mouse Button<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Everything was created during the jam by: TheShelfman</p>\n<p>Art from several asset-packs which can be found in the credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14fc29ad2f48e1d527fb811ba4e9ca59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheShelfman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
