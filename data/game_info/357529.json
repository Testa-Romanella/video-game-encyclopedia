The objective is to navigate \"Pufferfish\" through the rings, within 5 minutes (300 seconds). The puffer cannot swim however, so you have to inflate and deflate to move around.<br/><br/>---------<br/>This is my first game submission to itch.io in general, and it's for a Game Jam. I've been toying around with Unity3d for a few years, but have never felt compelled/pressured to release anything, so I joined this Game Jam thing just 3 hours prior to try it out. I didn't know at all how much I could do with a limited set of a time, so I aimed very low and simple. I managed to finish this up with an extra day remaining, so I plan on aiming higher next time :).<br/></p>\n<p>Mini Jam 33: Underwater</p>\n<p>\"https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-33-underwater\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:51:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/0112270d00eb250949f12f1143543210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lettucepie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
