You will need to manage oxygen, a limited supply where you can only refill at your lander, or in the event you construct extenders with scraps you salvage from other components.</p>\n<p>Pay attention to your temperature, as the oxygen will be dependent on it. For when it strays too low or too high, oxygen will start to decrease faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world is procedurally generated (though limited in size, not infinite), thus, you will have a different experience each round. The game also offers leaderboard to record how long you have survived.</p>\n<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>\n<p><strong>THIS GAME HAS KNOWN ISSUES DUE TO IT BEING A GAME DEVELOPED IN A GAME JAM! BELOW IS THE LISTED ISSUES:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>You can go far beyond the world border.</li><li>You can get stuck in mountains/rocks when spawning, thus there is a SPECIAL KEY for this. The tilde key (`, ~) can be used to RESET.\u00a0 (This is usually found below the ESC key)</li><li>Keymapping is not available.</li><li>Some features are unimplemented, such as pointers to your lander when you are lost.</li><li>The game may freeze on loading levels. This is normal. Do not try to force it to load, or exit.\u00a0</li><li>You will need to go out and into the inner circle (or blue circle) when constructing oxygen extenders.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>WASD (or arrow keys)\u00a0to move.</p>\n<p>Approach your lander to open the Repair Menu, where you can salvage items for scraps, or assemble parts by clicking on one of the parts on the left container, and clicking assemble on the right.</p>\n<p>Salvaging: This will salvage all items in your inventory, AND you cannot drop items, but gives you scraps on the amount of items you have in your inventory.</p>\n<p>[SHIFT] to sprint, this is risky and will absolutely decrease your oxygen faster.</p>\n<p>[E] or [F] to place extenders, they will consume four (4)\u00a0scraps.\u00a0They can be acquired by salvaging items on the lander.\u00a0</p>\n<p>EXTENDERS OUTER CIRCLE\u00a0must INTERSECT another OUTER CIRCLE\u00a0(white in color), this is seen on the extender itself or the lander, which at first must be intersected on the lander's circle.</p>\n<p>You must approach the LANDER or EXTENDERS closely to regenerate your OXYGEN and stabilize your TEMPERATURE.</p>\n<p>In the event of getting stuck, press the tilde key (~, `)\u00a0which is usually below your ESC key on the keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is all rights reserved, except the sounds even if they are\u00a0CC-0 in their license.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Published during the Godot Wild Jam #53 (WILD CARDS are in\u00a0Credits)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e2b7e3548db059edf7ab9e508a9ed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SirRANA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
