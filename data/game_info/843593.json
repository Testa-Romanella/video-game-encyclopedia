I Am Hedgedog is a Sci-Fi platformer about a hedgedog sent to investigate an abandoned ship. <br/>- CONTROLS:\u00a0 A and D or Left and Right arrow keys to move left and right. Space to jump. Left click to shoot towards mouse. I would advise downloading and playing this game on your computer instead of on itch.io but it is your preference.</p><p>-IMPORTANT: This is something of a demo for what could be a larger idea. I would love to expand on this, but I need feedback. I would appreciate it if you could let me know your thoughts in the comments.
