The theme for the jam was \"What home means to you.\" Our take on that was that the player needs to collect resources to build a home for him and his family.</p>\n<p>Your goal in this game is to go scavenging for resources and take them back to your home to repair it. Stepping on your welcome mat causes a building UI to appear, allowing you to repair things. Resources are spawned each time you leave your house, and you have an arrow to guide you back in case you get lost.</p>\n<p>To play the game: wasd or arrow keys to move. No pause menu, use alt+f4 to exit the game.</p>\n<p>This project was created in 48 hours, and is incomplete, but development has stopped. All of the programming was done by me.</p><p>Link to the original post on the Global Game Jam website: Apocalyptic Home</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/662/6622ebe76c164b78408d22d7c34319fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brad Musselman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
