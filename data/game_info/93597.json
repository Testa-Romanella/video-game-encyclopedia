The show progresses based on how well you are able to handle the struggles of the morning routine. Good luck!</p><p>Note: This was made for the Global Game Jam of 2016. This means this is not a finished game by any means. There's no AI to fill in remaining players so you'll need 4 players with each a controller to play.</p><p>Controls are <strong>controller only</strong>. Left joystick to move and 'A' to interact with objects.</p>\n<ul><li>Stan Loiseaux - Art</li><li>Juda-ben Gordier - Art</li><li>Dave van Verdegem - Programming</li><li>Stijn Delaruelle - Programming</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/56002718b17930c4863c1cfab065c06f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pajama Llama Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
