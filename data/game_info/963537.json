Tensions with Earth are building, and hit a boiling-point when in 2134 a rogue nation suddenly seizes as much Lunar property as it can with deadly force. As an MI6 agent, you are sent to a mining station taken over by enemy forces in the Hadley-Apennine region. Eliminate the invaders, and frustrate their efforts! You are on your own, so be resourceful, and fight for King and planet!<h3>A Lunar Environment</h3><br/>Feel how lunar gravity affects your gameplay. Achieve mad hops, send enemies flying, bounce around in the Lunar Pressurized Vehicle (LPV), or take off with a jetpack!<h3>Choose Your Weapons</h3><br/>Whether you are a gunslinger, heavy gunner, swordsman, or just like blowing things up, you will not be left out. Take on the enemy with a mixed arsenal of weapons that would otherwise weigh you down on Earth!<h3>Freedom of Movement</h3><br/><ul><li>Walk or run freely through the experience with smooth VR room-scale locomotion featuring 30 degree snap-turn for comfortable seated gameplay! Smooth player rotation is also supported as an option.<br/></li><li>Standing or sitting, the game knows the difference at all times so you do not have to pause the game to change between the two modes.<br/></li><li>No need to reach.
