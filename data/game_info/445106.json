You must hold down the button in order for the door to stay open. If you get off the button, the door will close. This applies for every button except the golden button. You must get both of your characters to step on the golden button to complete the level.</p>\n<p>Platforms - The white character can only step on white platforms, the black character can only step on black platforms. Both characters can step on the moving (animated) black and white platforms.</p>\n<p>Keys/LockedDoor - To pick up a key simply collide with the key with your character. The key that faces in the\u00a0right direction in the slot hole will open the locked door.\u00a0 Be careful, if you die while holding a key, the key might be impossible to obtain therefore leading to a restart. Also be aware that when you die, the key and locked door form will not restart or change in any way, it will simply remember that you opened the door and it will remember where you last left the key.</p>\n<p>Spikes - Avoid the spikes at all cost. If you touch these spikes they will automatically restart you to the beginning of the level. You must complete the level by having both characters step on a gold button without getting punctured by the spikes.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>There are 12 levels!
