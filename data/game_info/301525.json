It&#39;s time to move. NOW.<br />\nThen you realize... you don&#39;t know how to move this heap of metal.<br />\nEnslaved on an unknown planet, a stolen Nauticrawl is your only hope of escaping the wretched life you were born into. But now that you&#39;re at the helm, you have a whole new set of problems. The craft is full of levers, buttons, and gauges that make no sense to you. And even if they did, where would you go?<br />\nUncover the secrets of this world, figure out how to pilot the Nauticrawl, and chart a course for freedom. Or die trying.<br />\nMaster foreign contraptions and figure out how to pilot the mysterious Nauticrawl.<br />\nExplore randomly generated maps while uncovering the secrets of an unknown planet<br />\nIntercept communications, speak to natives, hack into devices, and chart a path to freedom.<br />\nNauticrawl takes apart dungeon-crawlers and roguelikes of the 90s, and rebuilds them back into a game unlike any you\u2019ve played before. Like the games from the generation that inspired it, Nauticrawl leaves you to your own devices... literally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T11:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f62/f62166d80ab5b023a5c47dfb29d5c07f.jpg", "website": "http://www.nauticrawlgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 54, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Armor Games", "Andrea Interguglielmi"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Armor Games", "Armor Games Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
