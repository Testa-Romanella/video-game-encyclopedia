It's little game is far from over.</p>\n<p>And you're next.</p>\n<p>A word from the developer~</p>\n<p>Now, just like the original - this game was made with the hardware limitations of the Sega Genesis and the content of the original creepypasta in mind. Therefore, it is not a full representation of my programming ability - remember that. Another note is that there are some areas of the game that are not 100% accurate to the creepypasta, and for good reason: the stages and events outlined in the original story are, simply; too short. Therefore, some little alterations had to be added to make the story viable as a game. Future updates will bring more content, too.</p>\n<p>Four and all related characters and content are copyright of BFB (Battle For Battle For Dream Island).</p>\n<p>Any one else I happened to forget to mention!
