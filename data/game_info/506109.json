{"id": 506109, "slug": "unriddle", "name": "Unriddle (itch)", "name_original": "Unriddle (itch)", "description": "<p><em>A deduction-action game with hidden illusionists and detectives.</em></p>\n<p>Unriddle is a multiplayer game which is played in short rounds, where the detectives try to identify the hidden illusionists and kill them. So, the purpose of the illusionists is the same; killing all the detectives while hiding their identities as long as possible.</p>\n<p>However, this is not a simple talk-vote-and-kill game. It requires quick reflexes to dodge the enemy bullets and smart plays to outwit your opponents. It pretty much has the controls of a regular MOBA game. And it's free. :)</p>\n<p>I would be glad if you want to try the game. Technically, it can be played between 2 and 9 players, but as in the case of deduction games, it becomes more fun with more players. You can download the server files for Windows or Linux to host your own server (which is recommended). Ideally, you should be playing with a group of friends over voice chat. You can also join our discord server to find people to play with or discuss the game: discord.gg/ejrqd8u</p>\n<p>Check out my YouTube channel for the videos of the game and other content regarding artificial intelligence or more games.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits for some of the assets I used:\r\n<p>Logo: Saro Hibardiyan</p>\n<p>Pointer Textures:</p>\n<p>Crosshair: https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/crosshair.html<br/>Pointer: https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/arrow-cursor.html</p>\n<p>Skill Icons:</p>\n<p>Sixth Sense: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/impact-point.html<br/>Shoot: https://game-icons.net/1x1/john-colburn/pistol-gun.html<br/>Sprint: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/sprint.html<br/>Totem: https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/totem.html<br/>Assasinate: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/sacrificial-dagger.html<br/>Blind: https://game-icons.net/1x1/skoll/sight-disabled.html<br/>Teleport: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/teleport.html<br/>Shadowcloak: https://game-icons.net/1x1/darkzaitzev/hooded-figure.html<br/>Fake Corpse: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/pirate-grave.html<br/>Illusion: https://game-icons.net/1x1/lorc/relationship-bounds.html<br/>Ammo: https://game-icons.net/1x1/sbed/ammo-box.html<br/>HP Potion: https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/health-potion.html</p>\n<p>Sounds:</p>\n<p>Gun: https://freesound.org/people/fastson/sounds/50618/<br/>Shadowcloak: https://freesound.org/people/bareform/sounds/218723/<br/>Star Collect: https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:41:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/3639582d6ff1435f237a8baced75cda6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AlperSekerci"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
