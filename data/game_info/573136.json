{"id": 573136, "slug": "the-help-desk", "name": "The Help Desk", "name_original": "The Help Desk", "description": "\"The Help Desk\" is a game of challenges, where you must try to solve all problems before time runs out. Each of these problems appears at random. Every time you play the same level, the number of problems and the type of problem will always be different.<br/><br/>The two types of problems that exist are swaps and configurations. The settings are simple. Just press space in front of the computer, and it will perform the configuration. Swaps are more complex, as you need to collect a computer at the location where the red arrow indicates. As it is possible to load only one computer at a time, with each new swap, you must return to the collection site.<br/><br/>Among all the challenges of the game, the biggest challenge that you will overcome in this experience is to escape from the users. If you are able to escape the users, you will be able to win the game.<br/><br/>This experience consists of 10 levels, where the total game time can vary between 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the amount of problems.<h3>ESCAPE FROM USERS</h3><br/><h3>SOLVE CHALLENGES</h3><br/><h3>SOLVE PROBLEMS</h3><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T02:35:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cb1fcd9ec137b398b1f3ad3f357ec5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leonardo S.
