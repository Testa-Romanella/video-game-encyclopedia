You're angry, so break as much stuff as possible before the hero comes to save you! Trigger chain reactions and break stuff without delay to keep your combo going, letting you rack up score multipliers in the hundreds!</p>\n\n<p>Made in less than 72 hours for the 2nd GMC JAM. Got sick in the middle of the jam and had to end it early. Didn't have time or energy to put a lot of polish into this, so there originally were no sound/music at all. However, it has since been updated with a great number of dynamic sound effects and fully composed music! Woo!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aaf09478f62d7c20477b88b36800241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
