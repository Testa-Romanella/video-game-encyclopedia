Reach the end before time runs out to meet your fate.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To reach the end of this adventure you will have to dodge Orcas and Walruses, in addition to not slipping on the oil slick. If you need help getting through the game, eating fish is a good way to extend the life of Fins.\r\n </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by the constant danger that penguins are subjected to due to climate change, pollution in the oceans or overfishing. And this is what we have reflected in our game, the race of an animal species against the dangers that lie in wait for it.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Jorge Pan - UI Designer and Programmer</p>\n<p>Luc\u00eda Bl\u00e1zquez - Artist, Designer and Story Writter</p>\n<p>Alejandro Rinc\u00f3n - Artist and Designer</p>\n<p>Andr\u00e9s Hormigo - Game Designer, Programmer and Story Writter</p>\n<p>Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez - Game Designer and Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724414c0175d661484a850ada605a4a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zorrocotrobot"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
