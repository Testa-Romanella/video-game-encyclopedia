It is up to the player to make them fall in such a way that combines them in chains of more than 4 with blocks of the same color. Doing this, the blocks get eliminated. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>The control scheme is based on the default keyboard control scheme for Puyo Champions, while also allowing for an optional version with WASD.<br/></p>\n<p>Some features include:</p>\n<p>- \"Levels\" based on the player's point score,\u00a0 which determine game speed<br/></p>\n<p>- Saved scores and a high score table</p>\n<p>- Preview of upcoming pieces</p>\n<p>- \"Holding\" pieces, allowing the player to keep one piece in reserve and swap it out for the current piece when needed</p>\n<p>- Being able to instantly drop pieces to the bottom, allowing players to play at a faster pace</p>\n<p>- Detection of combos, destruction chains and cleared boards, notifying the player with visual and sound effects (plus a point bonus)</p>\n<p>Some of these features were taken from Puyo games, while the holding feature is present in modern Tetris.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab6/ab68e0202bd84901ceb4699a93a4f51f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvaro Ferreira"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
