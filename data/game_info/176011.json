As the title suggests, it has bad audio setting for various assets, bad rigging for the turtles and the space outside the play area is clearly unfinished.</p>\n<p>You are a swamp animal expert who capture iguanas and turtles for the local pet store. Use the targeting system(red square) to lock onto the creature and click to capture then. Turtle earn you $10 while iguanas earn you $30. Turtles are so slow and easy to catch while iguana are not.
