Why is it here? What does it want?<br/><br/></strong>Pamela is a short survival horror game made in Unreal Engine 4. Developed by me, \"DaRealMrPickles\". Try to survive and discover the story that is hidden here.<br/><br/>I tried to make the game very gameplay focused as I feel many horror games do not focus much on the actual \"playing the game\" part. Let me know what you think and also be sure to report any bugs/issues.<br/><br/>Thanks! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T06:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eed042f38752475580f7651cee25e056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaRealMrPickles"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
