So I made a game in which you play as a pink-haired woman named April who\u00a0is late for her date.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Left and Right</strong> arrow keys to move</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> to jump</p>\n<p>April is rushing to meet her date before she concludes that she was stood up and leaves. Any innocent bystander who stands in April's way will be violently thrown aside as she barrels down the road. Unfortunately, there are heaps of dirt and trash cans everywhere on the sidewalk as well that April must avoid to reamin\u00a0clean. Late or not she can't show up with dirt all over herself. Especially not after having spent so long prettying herself up which is, in fact, the reason she is late. Preparing for such an event she grabbed 3 bars of soap before heading out to clean herself of any dirt, as one does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If April gets dirty more than 3 times it is game over.</p>\n<p>Music by Visager:\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T18:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/80707b456f92781092a160a120d4438d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
