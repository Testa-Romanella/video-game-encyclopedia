The game has you play as MTF Delta-5, a team that specializes in acquiring anomalies of interest to other groups (Cults, private military).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This is a prototype build, I decide to upload it as the game is currently on hold.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EXPECT BUGS, ISSUES, AND A GENERAL LACK OF POLISH</strong></p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions for the project, feel free to comment on them below.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>R to Reload</p>\n<p>Alt\u00a0+ R to Check Your 2 Mags</p>\n<p>T For Flashlight On/Off</p>\n<p>Q or E To Lean Either Direction</p>\n<p>Shift To Sprint.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>To restart the level, you can either restart the game or bring up the console with ` and type \"Open Mansion\". You can also go outside the building and press f on the small white cube.</p>\n<p>The demon will make a very loud noise when hunting, find some sort of funnel and hold your aim towards it, upon seeing the shadow appear, shoot at it</p>\n<p>Opening a door will lower your weapon for a minute, meaning your shots may not hit, try to breach a room with a friend.</p>\n<p>Check your corners, cultists can very easily sneak up on you.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to check behind you, the cultists will roam the building and occasionally will stroll into the room you're in, in multiplayer, get a friend to hold your 6.</p>\n<p>Don't sprint too much, it can take some time for your weapon to raise after sprinting, meaning you might get caught without your weapon.</p>\n<p>Don't fully auto the enemies, just put one in the head or a few in the body, your ammo supply is limited to 2 mags and you might want to use some of that in a sticky situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4ae5db5208f4cc1ca74d896d4d296ff0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frinky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
