Such as jumping, additional ghosts (Alla pacmania), different layouts, etcetera.</p>\n\n<p>Most notably, it also features Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man game modes, which also replicate the arcade originals with the same level of faithfulness.</p>\n\n<p>Think of it like a \u201csandbox pacman\u201d thing, but it is 100% playable and complete on its own as of today.<br/></p>\n<p>My original intention was to keep the gameplay as close as the original, ranging from ghost behavior, to speed and fright time and stuff. Graphics are x4 the original game's size. I've included a dip-switch-like configuration screen to further tweak the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:03:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6daba146d99b8037cf7a2ef172753c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Circlick Tech"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
