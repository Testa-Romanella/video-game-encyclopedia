If you insist.<br/>\r\n\tJust use your mouse.<br/>\r\n\tClick with it, I mean. At the right time.<br/>\r\n\tAnd move it. To run faster.<br/>\r\n\tBeware of the lights. They're usually attached to a car.<br/>\r\n\tThat's it.<br/>\r\n\tOh, that thing with the hi-score, well... better be a big number.</em>\n</p>\r\nProperly concocted instructions:<br/>\r\n- Click with the left mouse button to start or pause the green man walk.<br/>\r\n- When the light gets brighter, the car gets nearer. In that case, pause the walk and wait for the light to disappear.<br/>\r\n- Every step adds a point to the score.<br/>\r\n- Moving the cursor makes the man walk faster.<br/>\r\n- Sometimes the green man walking can stumble when blinded by the bright lights. If you click on play and he suddenly stops, QUICK click again!<br/>\r\n- If you get hit by a car, don't despair: you can immediately restart the game clicking on the green arrowed circle!<br/>\r\n- Your boring real life can be reached again pressing the \"Esc\" key.<br/>\r\n- Remember: Aim to the highest score ever! And ever.\r\n<p>\n<strong>Play's Extended Soundtrack is available here:<br/>\n</strong><strong>https://approductions.itch.io/play-extended-soundtrack</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Official Discord</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae4/ae4330ced8d0d34673c85f9dcbc601a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrea Pignataro"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
