You can either go in guns blazing, with a mad desire to re-colour the walls red or take a more delicate approach as you sneak your way around the level avoiding detection. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour main weapon can either be a sword which can deflect bullets, chop down your foes or be thrown for maximum bloodshed. A shield which can be thrown at multiple enemies at once or to reflect their bullets right back at them. A bow for silent long range kills without worrying about ammo. And finally a machine gun because sometimes the best solution is the loudest one. You also have a selection of bad ass gadgetry, starting with ninja stars and gas grenades leading into the more ridiculous pocket sized black holes and self destructive crabs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrent Features:<br/>\r\n6 weapons (not including the cutlery)<br/>\r\n25 gadgets<br/>\r\n5 levels<br/>\r\n4 enemy types<br/>\r\n3 game modes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-25T07:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4b97f6beb7b22541e8cc78ec0ab9e1.jpg", "website": "http://diatomicgames.com/", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 138, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 13}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 32, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 32, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diatomic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Diatomic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
