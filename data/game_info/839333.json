Master <strong>unique loop movement</strong>, build your dream frog with <strong>shiny upgrades</strong>, and you might be able to survive the ongoing <strong>waves of angry enemies and strong bosses</strong>!<br/><br/><h3>Skate that loop!</h3>Tired of moving by simply walking? Good news, that frog doesn't even know how to walk, but she sure as heck can <strong>skate</strong>!  <br/>Ride along the <strong>loop</strong> arena, turn around, jump, crouch, accelerate, do whatever you need to evade enemies attacks and give them a taste of your weapons!<br/><br/><h3>Choose cool upgrades!</h3>A simple ollie is cool and all, but how about doing a kickflip that's so fast that it summons thunder while swinging a huge sword and throwing fireballs? You could do that, or a backflip while blasting loud music and launching a bowling ball, that's up to you to decide!  <br/>Choose your <strong>weapons</strong>, change your skateboard <strong>tricks</strong>, upgrade your <strong>stats </strong>and become unstoppable!<br/><br/><h3>Survive waves of cute enemies!</h3>You thought you could skate peacefully today, but that<strong> frog army</strong> won't let you. They'll come bouncing, flying, rolling, and they'll even send their big <strong>bosses</strong>.  <br/>Do anything you can to keep them away, and be warned: they might be cute, but they sure are angry and <strong>many</strong>!<br/><br/><br/>Trailer music by Heatley Bros", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T05:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79a/79a26b3feeffc2639fbeae5d6de2e1af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Doot"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Doot"], "esrb_rating": null}
