Now you must complete your goals by using the touch screen and a stylus. Tap, scratch, and rub your stylus on the touch screen to play minigames that have you do everything from milking a cow and drawing a mustache to hurling stars at evil ninjas. You can even play some minigames by blowing into the DS&#39;s built-in microphone. The more minigames you clear, the more characters and items you unlock.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2004-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-17T22:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/667/667e109c7dd7c52b9cd5aa69a2310d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.34, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 27, "beaten": 81, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 15, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 60, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 61, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Intelligent Systems"], "genres": ["Action", "Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
