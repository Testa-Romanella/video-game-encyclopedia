Tolkien's works and the Lord of The Rings series.</strong><br/><br/><strong>AN AMBITIOUS YET FULL SANDBOX WORLD OF FANTASY, EPIC FANTASY STORY, AND CLASSIC MYSTICAL DYNAMICS ALL IN ONE...</strong><br/><br/>And it doesn't end there, because it shouldn't. And it won't...<h3>Experience Epic Fantasy Like Never Before...</h3><br/><h3>Follow a lore induced world driven by a powerful story...</h3><br/><h3>Enter and explore the dynamic ever changing world of Arden...</h3><br/><h3>Arden awaits it's warrior, and it's players are it...</h3><br/><br/><br/><strong>THE STORY</strong><br/><br/>The story takes place in the vast lands of Arden, and spans across eras, upon eras of history in the Wolfthorn story.<br/><br/>Though Arden has been brought many periods of peace, war waged for the longest in what the people and beings of the land called; The War of the Alliances or the Age of Dark.<br/><br/>It all began in the elvish haven of Zythil, the home of the White Council, and the order bringing grounds of Arden, that proved to bestow peace among the lands for ever so long...before Dazaak.<br/><br/>Dazaak previously head of the White Council, and over time, and time again, like all other mortal men, he was corrupted by hunger for his growing power, and fueled by his anger of his brother, who was a member of the White Council as well, and colleague of Dazaak, in a strong brothership that was what used to be ever so respected. <br/><br/>Dazaak\u2019s brother, who went by the name of Durudane, had wanted to become what his older brother Dazaak had, for years upon years, and consumed by his temptation to become more powerful in the Council, he was determined to seek a way to surpass Dazaak, however he may do so. Little did Dazaak know, Durudane was less of what he thought, and more of what he never would wish upon a being no matter their standing. Dazaak\u2019s brother Durudane, had found the lost Arcanoe, an artifact of dark magic that had been lost in time for ages. Consumed by it and his own temptation, Durudane fell to the darkest depths of pure evil imaginable. He was going to murder his brother, Dazaak no matter the cost. <br/><br/>And there in the night, he attempted, cloaked in dark robes, Durudane was planning to sneak upon Dazaak in his sleep, and just upon his wake Durudane struck, and Dazaak impaled his brother, Durudane in a rapid instinctful manner that any human would naturally possess. <br/><br/>The dark was not perished however, and upon Durudane\u2019s fall in shock, Dazaak fueled with amazement, stood in utter silence. The dark then left Durudane\u2019s soul, for he had grown so powerful, that the Arcanoe had grown in with his very soul, and when death occurred, the worst was bound to happen. Durudane let out a cry like no other man had in over 10,000 ages, and quickly realized what had happened, for a brief minute, he knew...he remembered the Arcanoe he vowed to keep in perishment. He had become the very evil he swore to protect Arden from. <br/><br/>With that, he let out a deep breathe, and his eyes turned red with fire, his skin, dark with no pigment, and his body scarred with dark vessels. <br/><br/>Dazaak had lost his brother, and became a leader of evil.<br/><br/>What once were peaceful lands, and a firm brothership were no more. The Arcanoe had rose once more and the armies of dark were about to be unleashed.<br/><br/>Dazaak had over time, corrupted the elves of Zythil, turning them into power hungry, brutal warriors, called orcs, and turned all the men he could of Arden into terrifying men of the east, The Thetes of Arden. <br/><br/>An alliance began to rise and thus, the war of the alliances had begun.<br/><br/>The light versus the ever growing dark, and mist of the east, and for the light, the last of the  armies of the alliances. <br/><br/>The alliances were formed before the council, in order to provide a method of hope for peace in times of need.<br/><br/>For should the Council ever fall, as it did, the armies of the alliances and what was left of them were to protect and restore peace to the lands of Arden. <br/><br/>That was their very intent, and that was what they were going to do. <br/><br/>And with that, the age of war...had begun yet again.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aafbb79e0c00e918f849349a562cbd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AerixArtGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AerixArtMediaGroup"], "esrb_rating": null}
