{"id": 136071, "slug": "to-my-dear-sarah", "name": "\"To My Dear Sarah\"", "name_original": "\"To My Dear Sarah\"", "description": "<p>\"To My Dear Sarah\" is an interactive narrative set in VR telling the story of Sarah who journeys through her past after losing her grandfather. She shared the fondest memories with him when she was a child and he would teach her the piano. Sarah's grandfather composed his granddaughter a song which he named \"To My Dear Sarah\". When Sarah was a teenager, she started to become distant and her grandfather was never able to hand her his gift to her. When she became an adult, her grandfather became distant and uninterested because of old age. Sarah takes this journey to the past in order to understand what went wrong and how things could have been fixed. This project is still in development. It was part of my senior project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dc/8dc6f9e64d81e7458fedd35c724bda55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sokigarden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
