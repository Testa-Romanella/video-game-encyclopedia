Explore infinite hallways, impossible shortcuts, and rooms bigger on the inside. Use them to surprise, flank and ambush your enemies.</p>\n<p>This game is in development, and is not feature complete yet. While you can play against bots in a 3 minute match, there is no multiplayer and there are no additional maps. In addition, due to the lack of lighting, the game uses grid textures to retain a sense of shape and perspective.</p>\n<p>This game cannot be open-source due to paid assets. However, I might do a tutorial series on how to achieve the techniques seen in the game. This includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Recursive\u00a0portal rendering</li><li>Skinned mesh cloning</li><li>Shooting raycasts through portals</li><li>AI NavMesh support</li><li>Recursive AI visibility checks through portals</li><li>Portal-friendly map design</li></ul>\n<p>Check my Twitter at\u00a0https://twitter.com/limdingwen to follow my progress.</p>\n<p>This project is the April 2020\u00a0entry for 1 Game A Month.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:39:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8e849026a1a4d97b562a13d76160477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lim Ding Wen"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
