Use your cunning to both grab the loot as well as destroy the tricky guardians who guard the large gems - multiple shots and/or special situations might make this task easier (as a tip) and boost karmic balance sustaining your life. Survive to the end and you'll be swimming in wealth --- not just with treasure but for accomplishment in completing this strange adventure.</p>\n<p>Playable across all platforms whether via emulator, Mini or real hardware. This version eliminates a nasty bug glitch for NTSC that I missed early in the game, as noted on the disk.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T03:51:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d00a4cb3d7ca2f7d35a44e1c9c8450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mo's Full F* Sci-Fi Adventures"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
