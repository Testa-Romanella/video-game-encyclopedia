The only remaining weapons at the end of this war were atomic weapons. 78% of the Earth's surface is subject to radiation, it is no longer viable. There was only one solution left: the Underwater Project. Humans were only living in underwater bunkers. Some locked themselves in artificial cryopreservation machines to preserve themselves longer. 3,000 years after these events, William O'connor wakes up in base number 707. But something is abnormal: there is no one there. The meters are showing that there is not much time left before the base runs out of fuel.<br/>You will play William O'connor, perhaps the last Irishman on earth, you will have to complete several important tasks in the 707 base: Find traces of the crew, information about your daughter and get out of here!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You don't just control William O'connor.
