From tedious everyday routines to spiritual self-discovery, Sam's world is changing according to her wishes. <br/><br/>The game's main idea has a lot in common with Buddhist philosophy. Bardo is a Tibetan word meaning a transition, being BETWEEN something and something else. For instance, between sleep and wakefulness, or between life and death. It can be said that we all are in Bardo. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ad/1addecad34f02460ba0d30298635e645.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["backyard-team"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
