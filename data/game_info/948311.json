More passengers mean more scores and more times! If you accidentally hit somewhere your score point and your time\u00a0decreases and it's related to your speed, so drive carefully!</p>\n<p>You can interact with the bus in the FPS mode. Just switch your camera and try to open and close the bus doors.\u00a0Don't forget, you must\u00a0open the bus doors and slow down to near the bus stops while boarding and disembarking passengers.<br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard and Mouse\u00a0scheme for the gameplay:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f976d854e0b93e387782231615a373e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MertBalkan"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
