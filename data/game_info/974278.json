Build your settlement on the surface map where you grow crops and tend to your livestock or let your settlers do that for you. Your settlers can chop trees, harvest crops, sheer sheep and milk cows. Explore multiple levels of dungeons with enemies below the surface, the depper you go, the better the resources you can find.
