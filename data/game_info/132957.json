It is a sequel to \r\n\tSwan Hill, a twine story you can find here. Swan Hill takes most readers ten to fifteen minutes to play.\r\n</p><p>Six Months is <strong>slow-burning, low-key fantasy fiction</strong> in a world where magic is rare and ethically dubious. It's a murder mystery about power, family, and faking it until you make it. If you like Swan Hill, you can expect the final version of Six Months to be more of the same.</p>Play the Six Months Demo online here.<p>\r\n\tYou can download the Six Months demo below.
