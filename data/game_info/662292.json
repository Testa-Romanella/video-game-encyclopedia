Watch out for nasty piggies. There is no penalty for dying, so try try again.

Take a leap of faith at the right slanted tree to get to the box platform</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>You move the box by pressing and holding\u00a0 \"S\" to vibrate it along. Holding a high note (\"A\" button)\u00a0 simultaneously allows you to move it more quickly<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>EXTRA EXTRA SPOILERS</em></strong> (exactly how to beat the game the right way - don't read if you want to figure it out for yourself and look here if you have trouble :D )</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treat others how you want to be treated,</em></strong> so don't hurt the innocent vines, spiders or wild animal or you will get a \"try again\" message from the pig boss. You must use the box to free the critters without harming the innocents. You must do this in the right order to be able to use the box all three times</p>\n<p>Correct order to free critters with box:</p>\n<p>First move the box right to drop it down and position it under the platform to reach the door. Move the cage (also by pressing \"S\" for low note) to the left and drop it onto the animal to be able to get around it and save the critter.</p>\n<p>Then go back up to where you left the box ( under the 1st door platform) and move it to the left under the critter by the spiders, if you\u00a0 put it between the two slanted trees you can jump through the platform and pop up under the critter\u00a0without having to get through the spiders.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then hop up to the platform above\u00a0the critter and drop back down on the right to get back to the box. This time push it to the right and drop it down to the platform near the first critter that was blocked by vines. You can now use the box to\u00a0make the jump up to that critter to save it from this side that doesn't have any vines.</p>\n\n<p>Music and voice overs were made by us.

If you complete the game the \"right way\"\u00a0the first time (and never see the pig boss with a \"try again\" message - then he won't kill you LOL</p>\n\n<p>What I didn't have time to add:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>apple collecting -</strong> you can only throw apples you have collected. vibrate them off the trees or chop down the trees to get them faster</li><li>an actual pig <strong>boss battle</strong>!</li><li>a <strong>health bar</strong> so you can get hit more than once!!!! (also would have DEFINITELY been needed for a boss battle.)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What was supposed to happen:</strong></p>\n<p>When you get to the pig boss:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0each critter you helped would help you fight by throwing apples\u00a0</li><li>Anything you killed would be there fighting against you - pigs, vines, spiders,\u00a0 the wild animal (yeah that is a lot to fight!!! so it would be best not to kill things)</li><li>If you chopped down trees for apples then you would not have apples to throw during the fight (which would be near impossible since the pig boss is really too difficult to defeat with only\u00a0melee attacks)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T03:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/6852ff9b08a40995e1ad2e8cd817c2a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Two Felt Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
