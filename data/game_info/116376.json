They're no longer available on the Google Play Store, but since they were published under a Creative Commons license, I decided to port them to Ren'Py to share with other music lovers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn FMA3110's own words:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Can horror stories be more than just entertainment?<br/>\r\n\tOf course they can, therefore, inspired by the fact that I'm born on the 31st October and I am a Mozart fan, whose name day is celebrated on the very same date, I wrote this story.<br/>\r\n\tIt's not just text: images and, above all, music are part of the experience.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe Ren'Py version features text-to-speech support, including added captions for important text in the images of the first story.
