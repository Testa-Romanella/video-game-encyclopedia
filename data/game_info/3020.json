Carefully crafted comics establish and maintain the story line between battles, lending the action increased drama. The goal of the game is to kill all the enemies in a particular setting, so as to unlock the gate and proceed on to the next stage. The player controls the Samurai with his finger on the touch-screen, moving him in all four directions. Defensively, the player swipes their finger left, right, or up to evade an enemy attack. Swiping in this way over the enemy controls the player's attack. Successfully combining swipes activates powerful combination attacks. <br/><br/>Gameplay is set in the midst of the Japanese Sengoku period, and the player is Daisuke Shimada, a wandering Samurai. It is the most dangerous of times, and Daisuke must ultimately face the evil Daimyo Hattoro, who has spread fear and terror throughout the countryside. Many battles must be won before meeting Daimyo, and Daisuke does battle with enemies in many villages throughout feudal 16th century Japan. There are a great variety of settings in which battles are fought, and highly detailed foliage, bridges, arenas, houses, statues, streets, etc. The game is played from an overhead point of view and both graphics and movement are highly realistic within the stylized motif of the action.<br/><br/>\u2022 First hack and slash game developed specifically to leverage the iPAD touch screen.<br/>\u2022 Deadly Dojo only for iPad !!!<br/>\u2022 No more virtual joysticks or gamepads, only your finger and touchscreen.<br/>\u2022 Visit several unique environments in the Japan in a feudal 16th century setting.<br/>\u2022 Unlock all combo attacks and master your skills.<br/>\u2022 Never before seen comics storytelling<br/>\u2022 Special Dojo mode.
