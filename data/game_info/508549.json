The task is simple - find identical images and link them together with three lines max. Try to solve each puzzle before the time runs out! <br/><br/>How to play<br/>Tap one time to select a tile. Then find an alike tile to link it with. Try to imagine a future path between them. The puzzle allows to draw three lines maximum connected at a 90 degree angle. Can you link tiles like that? If yes, you're good to tap for the second time. By the way, the longer the path - more bonuses you'll get. Use your brain and logic!<br/><br/>Doesn't sound challenging enough? Well, try the bomb mode, where certain tiles are blocked and very explosive! Or check out the sliding mode, where each row slides aside as you crush a pair of blocks. <br/><br/>Why we love TapTap Match:<br/><br/>- Colorful collections of tiles with sweets, fruits and other cute images on them!<br/>- More than 1000 levels<br/>- Challenging extra modes<br/>- Various hints <br/>- Progress saving puzzle game<br/><br/>Such a simple and cool application to relax and train the brain!
