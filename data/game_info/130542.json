The major producer of bio-degradable toys which come\u00a0with the children's meals has never had it so good, and so to keep up\u00a0with the increased demand has installed an automated production line to\u00a0produce everything quickly &amp; efficiently.</p>\n<p>But\u00a0one night the machine mysteriously starts making the wrong toys - all\u00a0mis-formed &amp; broken - so you've been hired to keep an eye on\u00a0the\u00a0machines to ensure each part of each toy is stamped correctly into\u00a0shape...</p>\n\n<p>A simple and\u00a0colourful game - easy to get the hang of, but difficult to\u00a0master - becoming a frantic battle of\u00a0concentration as you try to juggle the settings of up to four stamping\u00a0machines at once so each toy is correct and ready for shipping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> -\u00a0\"<em>There is very little to complain\u00a0about with Factory Daze. The pace of the game varies from\u00a0sedate\u00a0to frantic, but even as you get through some of the more pedestrian\u00a0stages, you get a metal work out. This is one of the best\u00a0Spectrum releases that you'll see this year</em>\"\u00a0- 9/10</p>\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong> - <strong>Sizzler</strong> -\u00a0\"<em>Factory Daze is almost\u00a0worryingly cute. The in-game music is cheerful to a degree\u00a0that\u00a0could get a job presenting children's television, and the little toys\u00a0working their way through the production process includes delightful\u00a0robots of various descriptions, floppy disks, Space Invaders-inspired\u00a0aliens, assorted kitchen utensils, and even the fast food itself</em>\"\u00a0- 92%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/480/48026e3735937d9fe36ed5f775e8f615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
