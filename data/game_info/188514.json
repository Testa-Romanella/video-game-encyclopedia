However, you will find that the movement system in this game is (highly likely) completely different from any other VR game you have ever played. Rather than teleportation or any of the other more popular movement methods, in this game you get the ability to fly.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a few enemy types to choose from: the targets cannot harm you. The attackers shoot you. And the mines kill you if you touch them.<br/></p>\n<p>See how high a score you can achieve.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun :)</p>\n\n<p>P.S.</p>\n<p>The game has no audio.<br/></p>\n<p>The game may have bugs. If you find any, please let me know and I will try to fix them when I get the chance.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c56049a1975264631809e80b72856d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["toba1020"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
