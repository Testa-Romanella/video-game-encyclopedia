However there is a frankly  rediculous number of guard. Use your wits (and their lack thereof) to make you way to victory.</p><p>As this is Ludum Dare (Comp) I only had 48 Hours, so there is only one level but I have all the bits necessary to make more, if there's demand for it. Honestly it was the topic I least wanted to cover, but I think I managed to spin it into something I like and wouldn't mind working on some more.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44d7cb2ed764785a3758fa5fceb7f24e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ilseroth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
