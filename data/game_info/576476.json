Originally, the manor belonged to a friendly enough Grandma, whose husband died, and people started to see her less and less. They started to hear noises, and see strange red lights coming from it. Whenever someone went to check, the Grandma was nowhere to be seen, and the manor was empty. Eventually, a new family moved in, only to be the victims of a gruesome murder where the young daughter, Cassidy, was believed to have witnessed it all.<h3>Gameplay</h3>Going through a series of 3 chapters, you'll make your way through the manor, basement, and local area surrounding the manor to gather information and escape the grips of anyone chasing you. Using features such as a timed night vision camera, or hidden messages displayed by your flashlight, you can get through.<br/><br/>Each chapter is unique. The first chapter focused on psychological horror, made to build ambiance and tension. The second chapter will test your stealth. Sneak around the enemies and don\u2019t get caught. The third chapter is a mix of the other two chapters, requiring everything you\u2019ve learned to get through it. <br/><br/><br/>This game consists of three main chapters:<br/><br/><strong>The Manor</strong><br/>An ever-changing manor, once a hotel in the early 1900s, until an old lady only known as Grandma bought the hotel, and converted it into a home. The long corridors of the hotel still exist, and its empty rooms collect dust. The manor will be the starting place for you, as the player. You'll walk the halls, collecting information on your thesis, taking photos, and eventually... try to escape. The manor is changing as you go along, rooms won't always be the same, so make sure to check everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Basement</strong><br/>The basement, directly below the manor, is where the hotel would store all its food and drink. Its old machinery will creak as you try to sneak around. It's dark, but luckily you will have a source of light to help you find your way around, but, I warn you, watch out for the delay. You don't want it to run out at the wrong time.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Forest</strong><br/>A village hiding in the depths of the forest, one that no one has heard of. A village succumbed to the same doomed destiny as the Granny that lived at the manor. Taking over by new beings that know when someone doesn\u2019t belong. Unfortunately for you, you\u2019re that someone. <br/><br/><h3>Paranormal Events</h3>A series of paranormal events will occur during your playthrough of this game. Light bulbs exploding, changing rooms, random sounds and more will help build up an atmospheric experience and give you the horror game you're looking for.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T04:02:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/277/2779057081554d60e0ef0b5c9bc4f927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Jobson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Primary"], "esrb_rating": null}
