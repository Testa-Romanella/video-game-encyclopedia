Protect the plane and yourself\u00a0from\u00a0incoming attacks from trucks, police cars, helicopters, gunships, jets and extraterrestrials.\u00a0Why are you protecting the plane? Is there government conspiracy? Is Barry Seal attempting to\u00a0escape with a plane full of drugs? Are aliens behind everything? You will\u00a0not find the answer to those questions in this game, but you will get to shoot a lot of things.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my first game. Thanks for taking a look at it. Much love to anyone\u00a0that supported the initial release\u00a0with a donation, your support\u00a0is what keeps me going while working on the next game. xoxo - Jim</p>\n<p>CREDITS:\u00a0CODE, ART, DESIGN &amp; SFX -\u00a0Jim Lessels -\u00a0BETA TESTING -\u00a0Ben Van Eijk -\u00a0MUSIC -\u00a0Gunnar Olsen - Detour,\u00a0AJ7 - Level Up,\u00a0Vibe Tracks - Invisible\u00a0- SOUND EFFECTS -\u00a0Mark DiAngelo, freesfx.uk.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/489/4895489b0d3d35c4ce72ea1520aecf32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jim Lessels"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
