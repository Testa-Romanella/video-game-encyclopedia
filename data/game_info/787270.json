Your goal is to capture 5 spriteGears in order to destroy the shadow creatures who are treating the universe.</p>\r\nHistory\r\n<p>I made the original version of this game for the TIGSource\u00a0Assemblee jam\u00a0in 2009, where artists created\u00a0art\u00a0in its first half, and coders used these assets to create\u00a0games\u00a0in the second one. The original version was programmed in\u00a0Java in about 36 hours of development (see devlog).</p>\n<p>Some years afterward, I decided to remake this in JavaScript. The remake was made by jucarave\u00a0while working for Slashware Interactive. It was pretty faithful and added sound effects too.</p>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>Source code (Java Version)</li><li>Assemblee Entry thread</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Assemblee Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Easyname\u00a0-\u00a0SpriteGears and Ships</li><li>dbb\u00a0-\u00a0Space background</li><li>tocky\u00a0-\u00a0Mothership sprite</li><li>Mr TriangleHead\u00a0-\u00a0Square blocks</li><li>agj\u00a0-\u00a0Adoquin font</li><li>Craig Stern - In-game\u00a0music</li><li>Jorge Boscan- In-game\u00a0music</li><li>Wyvern - Title music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f7/3f7bb0020c57e1c5735ac0a86455ee7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Slashie"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
