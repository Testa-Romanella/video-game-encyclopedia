You work the night shift and your only responsibility is to collect people's belongings that are left inside the cinema and place them in lost and found.</p>\n<p>The game currently only has one night and is in active development.<br/></p>\n<p>Throughout the first night, you will have to collect people's belongings while avoiding a paranormal entity simply named 'The Shadow'. She can appear all around you, and makes a distinct noise when she does, so even if you can't immediately see her, know that she is still there.</p>\n<p>The Shadow lurks in the dark but only appears in the light, so the only option to avoid imminent death is to put yourself in the dark where she can't attack you.</p>\n<p>This is currently the first build of the game, so if you experience any bugs, please email me at beastybevan@gmail.com. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5cd356df18239399243cb180fbe2a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beastybevan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
