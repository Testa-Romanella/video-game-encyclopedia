It is the sequel to Castlevania: The Lecarde Chronicles. </p>\n<p>Unlike its predecessor, The Lecarde Chronicles 2 follows a nonlinear approach, borrowing elements from Castlevania II: Simon&#39;s Quest and various Metroidvania titles. While there is no leveling system, you may strengthen your character by collecting HP extenders, heart extenders, weapons, armor, rings, necklaces and artifacts. However, defeat is inevitable if you attempt to fight certain enemies without the necessary strength. </p>\n<p>This game is famous among fan-made games for its gorgeous music performance, the miracle reunion of official Castlevania game voice actors, and its well presented overall atmosphere.</p>\n<p>info: https://castlevaniafan.fandom.com/wiki/Castlevania:_The_Lecarde_Chronicles_2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T11:46:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b04c2bac5b6fc3379ce383c23bf90a1.jpg", "website": "http://the-mig-page.wifeo.com/castlevania-the-lecarde-chronicles-2013.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Migami Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
