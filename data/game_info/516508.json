As you are surely aware, the supreme leader\u00a0<strong>Ronald Dump</strong>\u00a0is taking over the country once again and it is in our hands to save this country. We must help our lizard savior <strong>Johny Buythem</strong> to get more then 50% votes to\u00a0become the supreme leader!\u00a0Count all his votes, and destroy all Dump ones. We are <strong>COUNTING</strong> on you! And beware of the cunning Eagle!</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work:</strong></p>\n<p>You play as Vote-counter, the person responsible for sorting vote ballots. But you have a more important job! You have 60 seconds to make sure Johny Buythem wins this election. For that you need to quickly decide whether the ballot is marked as Johny\u00b4s and needs to be swiped left into the mailing box or Dump\u00b4s vote and thus sent right, directly into the shredding machine. But watch out! The cunning eagle is watching all your decisions and will let you know when you make a mistake. Can you make sure that Johny gets <strong>more than 50%</strong> of votes and becomes the next supreme leader? Or will the world fall in chaos under the supremacy of Ronald Dump. That\u00b4s for you to decide! And you can always compare your results with agents in other states.</p>\n<p><strong>This game features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ballot sorting</li><li>Two leaders</li><li>Cunning eagle</li><li>MORE ballot sorting...with a twist ;)</li><li>And more!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>OR To swipe ballot left into the ballot box</p>\n<p>OR\u00a0To swipe ballot right into the shredder box</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59a0731f6a6a4264b5ea12558469fafe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ilirion", "Deathress", "Mates1912"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
