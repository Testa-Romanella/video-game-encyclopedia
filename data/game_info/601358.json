It was provided by the teachers and the TAs of our course. We only made modifications for the purpose of the project. We don't own the right to this project.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you find this game, we kindly ask you to play with all three different versions included in the game and selectable from the Menu before filling the survey. All data is collected anonymously. Once we get the final exam done, we can assure you that the data collected from the play sessions and from the survey will be deleted.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t even have to download anything, the game is accessible from your browser, though for the best experience we ask you to play it on a PC or on a laptop (and preferably use the Chrome browser). You don\u2019t have to be an experienced player, moreover, for research purposes, it is nice if we can get data from people who usually don\u2019t play any games.<br/><br/>By: Bavakaruni Vaishnavi Bavananthan, Andrea Tervisin, El\u0151d Vizi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T05:05:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12f/12f4370970114cdcaac0e8cda6946c41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vizielod"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
