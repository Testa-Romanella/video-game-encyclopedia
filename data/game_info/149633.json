{"id": 149633, "slug": "apple-rumble", "name": "Apple Rumble", "name_original": "Apple Rumble", "description": "<p>In honour of both the Pixelles showcase and the 2nd Annual Critical Hit Pre-Jam, I am releasing Apple Rumble, the game that I made last year during the Concordia Pre-Jam. I usually work in teams during jams, but for this game I decided to go it alone, composing original music in Tux Guitar, animating in PyxelEdit and Photoshop, and programming in Construct 2. The only thing that I would have liked to have implemented that I didn't have time to at the jam is a character selection screen with more characters. </p><p>This version is the one that I made at the jam in under 48 hours. I hope it will encourage other gamemakers (especially first-timers or those interested in Critical Hit) to give their idea a shot, no matter how ridiculous (mutated apples, like, really?). </p><p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p><p>PLAYER 1</p><p>A: left</p><p>D: right</p><p>W: jump/double jump</p><p>2xS: shield</p><p>D/A + shift: charge</p><p>D/A + spacebar: bite</p><p>Player 2: </p><p>left arrow: left</p><p>right arrow: right</p><p>up arrow: jump/double jump</p><p>2x down arrow: shield</p><p>right/left + enter: charge</p><p>right/left + ctrl: bite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c69/c692dab57e6e3a6cd605f4c5ae1b72e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jekagames"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
