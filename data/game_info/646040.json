In time I'd like this to grow into a full polished game, and will continue to work on it until I achieve that. This is my pet project I've worked on for a while now, and it's finally in a state where it can be played. It's quite rough, but I'm looking to get feedback while working on this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/083ab2e77e2e87d8c2955e995b47132e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coma70se"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
