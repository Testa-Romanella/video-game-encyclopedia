{"id": 502180, "slug": "gravity-field", "name": "Gravity Field", "name_original": "Gravity Field", "description": "Gravity Field is a space-logic puzzle with time-inverted objects (cubes), in which there is no top or bottom.<br/>\r\nThe game is made in a minimalist style - the levels are cubic rooms, which contain only the necessary items that perform a specific function. You will have to run along the walls and ceiling, although there is no clear definition of where is the top and where is the bottom. In this case, it will be necessary to solve various kinds of puzzles, sometimes resorting to time inversion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game you will see gravitational fields, each of which has its own direction of gravity, entering into which, the gravitational force of this field will act on you. Outside the field, weightlessness will affect you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn the levels you will come across closed doors, the opening of which will not be obvious. Use cubes, buttons, connectors to open them!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn some puzzles you will see the time inversion icon - this means that the time for some items will go backwards! Use this to solve another problem!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have no plot in the game - because it is not needed here. This game is for real puzzle lovers. You have a list of levels, tasks in which you have to solve. And after that, new levels will open for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-09T08:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04d/04dd4c1e191f9a2294cee027345fdce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 53}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoerGame"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SoerGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
