The habitable regions of this new continent have been divided up and\u00a0sold to the highest bidder. Entirely\u00a0new cities are stomped\u00a0out of the ground, surrounded with lush\u00a0gardens and supplied by local produce. Business is booming for manufacturers of heat lamps and fertilizer.\u00a0In the aftermath of the Great Collapse and the subsequent ban on science, megacorporations have established hidden\u00a0facilities where the world's greatest minds operate under strict NDA.</em></p>\n<p><em>You join one such facility as their new security officer. A recent discovery worth billions\u00a0-- something to do with ancient micro-organisms found in\u00a0Antarctica's soil -- has left the head of the\u00a0company very worried about corporate espionage. Your skills are put to the test soon after your arrival, as the crew grow distrustful of each other\u00a0and start acting out of character. It is not long until the first body is found... or what's left of it.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: left mouse button.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Keyboard controls: arrow keys\u00a0to select buttons (or Tab to cycle through buttons, or\u00a01/2/3 to jump to buttons), Space to confirm.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is in active development until September 18th.
