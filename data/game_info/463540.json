Fight as different heroes and explore their decks. Play against the computer or a friend sitting next to you. Master powerful combos and achieve victory. Simple to get into, challenging to master.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is the first game\u00a0I'm proud to show and share around. I know it's not the next big hit from an AAA studio, but I worked super hard for many weeks, learned a lot, and most importantly: had tons of fun. I'd love to hear your thoughts and your feedback. If there's something you'd like to share directly with me, my twitter handles are @MraveniskoDev and\u00a0@DanielBreiner_.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b810a99485d3d07b77d5e2d9fa1eb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MraveniskoDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
