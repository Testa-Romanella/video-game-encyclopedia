The simulation consists of 5 gamemodes: 2 practice modes and 3 challenge modes. The practice or free play modes are for practicing using the robot, and the challenge modes are made to simulate the actual competition experience. The simulation is not perfect, and it is possible to glitch the robot. If this happens, and it does not automatically reset, simply pause and press the reset button. The challenge mode point scoring is the cryptobox and being on the balancing stone at the end of the challenge. This includes all four cryptoboxes - both the red and blue ones.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When you finish a challenge mode round, one of the options is \"Submit my score\". From here, you will be prompted to enter a name and you will be given a personal 'hash' of your points, name, date, challenge type, and a few other things. This is for a distributed leaderboard system, but only works locally, so the leaderboard will be unavailable, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>To run, download the folder and extract all three files to one folder. Make sure that when you run it, the unity file is in the same folder as the Data folder and the .dll file.</p>\n<p>If you happen to have a controller that connects to your computer, the game <em>is</em> controller compatible. The controller controls are on the pause menu as well as below.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD / arrows / left stick / dpad (maybe) = translate forward/backward/left/right</p>\n<p>Q/E/Pgup/Pgdown/Right stick left/right = rotate</p>\n<p>= / - / bumpers = raise/lower lift</p>\n<p>[ / ] / triggers = open/close claw<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c291f73e713ffd0cbf06df73e4ff09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["minerharryFTC12010"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
