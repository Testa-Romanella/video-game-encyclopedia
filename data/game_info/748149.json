In the game, you play as a firefighter to rescue the fire. I'm an indie developer and this game is all made by me, if you like the game, please donate to me. I'm so grateful for every bit of your funding. I will be more motivated to develop some free indie games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T15:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/405/40558114d5f90dbf3c59a4278a28a6ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cloudinnng"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
