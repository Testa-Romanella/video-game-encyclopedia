They don\u2019t know about themselves yet, or what role each member should take in the group; which hue to be colored to create their own art.\u201d<br/>\u201cThat\u2019s where the fans will get involved: Coloring their idols.\u201d<br/>\u201cI\u2019d be more than happy if I could be part of the process in making the DOT8x8 masterpiece: The fans created art.\u201d<br/><br/>I had an eye on DOT8x8 since they first made their debut, and they definitely put priority on their communication with fans. <br/>Therefore, the handshaking events are very important for them.<br/>Kamiya himself goes there as a member of the event staff and guides each fan to be able to shake hands with his/her favorite idol.<br/><br/>\u201cNaturally, DOT8x8 hold their handshaking events often to create art between their fans and them. By meeting their fans, the group gains confidence through fan support in hope they will grow better.

We hold handshaking events at the YOBU department store regularly. We hope everyone comes to these events to get to know the group, especially those who have never heard of DOT8x8 before.\u201d<br/><br/>Although DOT8x8 does not get the recognition it deserves, Ryuichi Kamiya says with glint in his eye, \u201cbut they will be soon.\u201d <br/>I thought the same thing after seeing their fans' enthusiasm at their handshaking event.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2904357af2a076b93f3d7e6323142cff_S41VRYR.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kikaku Damashii"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["KIKAKU DAMASHII"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
