{"id": 15824, "slug": "only-if", "name": "Only If", "name_original": "Only If", "description": "<p>Only If is a first-person adventure indie game developed by Creability.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>After a party at his crush&#39;s house, Anthony awakes in a room he&#39;d never been before. He attempts to exit the house, but a mysterious voice from the phone screams insults at Anthony and tells him where to find the exit. Tony follows the clues and leaves the house.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main gameplay mechanic is based on exploration. Like in most escape room games, it is necessary for the players to look for clues in the environment they are in at the moment. Further into the game, the levels are no longer set in a house, but in a park with the landscapes of it being used for several puzzles. </p>\n<p>From level to level, several gameplay mechanics change with the only gameplay element that stays the same is the character movement or item interaction. Everything else is subject to change. These gameplay elements can be used as a puzzle piece in several levels, but most of the time they create an obstacle for the player to pass.</p>\n<p>The developers put a heavy emphasis on the fact that gameplay mechanics were meant to be experimental and unpredictable. This effect is achieved by avoiding the use of the \u201cWhat you see is what you get\u201d principle. There are multiple unexpected turns present in the game. For example, at some point of the game, the players have to jump down a ledge. It first it appears that the main character will fall to his sudden death, yet it appears to be the right direction to move to.</p>", "metacritic": 39, "released": "2014-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-13T17:58:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb42064f754bd057f6e605021ab1e9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.97, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1252, "beaten": 33, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Creability"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Creability"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
