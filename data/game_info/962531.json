It challenges you to complete all wires as fast as possible to earn more and more points.<br/>Consider the game as one of our first projects we publish, so feel free to give us any feedback so we can improve your experience.<h3>Different Modes</h3>The story mode is the core of Hot Wire VR. You need to complete every single wire to earn a spot in the high score list.<br/>In case you want to practice there is the option to train your skills individually for each specific wire. This is called the wire selection mode.<h3>The Real Challenge</h3>The game is not only about avoiding the wire itself. That would be too easy. You need to face different obstacles on your way through, such as moving barriers and a laser shooting space shark. The further you get the more difficult and complex the wires become.<br/><br/>Try. Fail. Start over.
