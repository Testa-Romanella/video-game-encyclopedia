It is buggy, it is unbalanced, and it lacks the touch of a skilled hand. However, I do believe it is fun to play for a few minutes. Please don't be mad when you realize that you've downloaded an amateur's learning project! But if you understand this and choose to play it regardless, you have my thanks. It means a lot to me.</p>\n<p>If there is a genuine interest in the concept of Piggy Pong, I will work to patch bugs, polish, and introduce new content. Otherwise, keep an eye out for new games!</p>\n<p>Pig out!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: <em>Move Player 1</em></li><li>WASD: <em>Move Player 2</em></li><li>ENTER: <em>select option</em></li><li>ESC: <em>pause menu</em></li><li>M: <em>mute</em></li><li><strong>Gamepads are supported!</strong> Use the D-pad to move and action buttons to select, pause, etc.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Guest Composer FluteBoy wrote the tutorial song, \"Piggy Wisdom.\" Jack is a talented musician and I'm honored to have his work in my game.</li><li>Heartbeast taught me how to use the Godot engine.
