{"id": 952652, "slug": "upside-out", "name": "Upside Out", "name_original": "Upside Out", "description": "<p><strong>UpsideOut\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>UpsideOut is a parkour game inspired by the Turkish TV show Wipeout Parkour, with additional parkour ideas implemented by us.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Features</strong>\r\n\r\nUpsideOut includes several exciting features that make the game both challenging and engaging:\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique parkour levels with an upside-down viewpoint:\r\n\r\n<p>The game's levels are designed to be both fun and challenging, with an upside-down viewpoint that requires players to think creatively and use their parkour skills to make their way through each level. And you can change your viewpoint if you want to.\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>Hookable drones to help you proceed through the levels:\r\n</strong>\n<p>Throughout the game, players must use hookable drones to help them navigate through the levels. These drones can be used to swing across gaps and reach higher areas that would otherwise be impossible to access.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCompetitive levels with other artificial players where time is a factor:\r\n\r\n<p>The game also includes competitive levels that pit players against each other in a race to the finish. In these levels, time is a crucial factor, and players must use their parkour skills to complete the level as quickly as possible.\r\n</p>\n\r\nFinal game with a time limit - finish before time runs out to win:\r\n\r\n<p>The final game is the most challenging part of UpsideOut, with a strict time limit that players must adhere to in order to win. To win the final game, players must use all of their parkour skills and speed to navigate through a series of obstacles and reach the finish line before time runs out.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow UpsideOut was Created\r\n<p>\n</p><p>Tu\u011fcan \u00c7a\u011flayan:\u00a0The idea for UpsideOut came to me when I saw old clips of Wipeout Turkey on YouTube, and I was inspired by the idea of creating a parkour game that incorporated some of the elements of the TV show. I spent like 6 days developing UpsideOut, adding new parkour ideas and features to make the game both fun and challenging.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\n<p>Playing UpsideOut is easy! Simply use the WASD keys to move your character around the level, and use the space bar to jump. To use the hookable drones, press the Left Mouse key to grab onto them and swing across gaps . And in the \"Tunnel Of UpsideOut\" map you can change gravity with the key Z. Be sure to watch out for obstacles and hazards along the way, and try to complete each level as quickly as possible to go through the next level.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T09:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b30b0a52dc072c814b0757d9417398b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Room:206"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
