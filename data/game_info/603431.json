There is no fighting back; if the player is to survive, they must navigate an open-exploration level to find their way back to the road. But the darker it gets, the more coyotes start to hunt for vulnerable prey, and should the player still be lost by the time the sun goes down, hope of surviving the night is out of the question.<br/></p>\n<p>To make matters worse, the thirst has started to take hold, and the longer the player lasts out here, the more they hallucinate, meaning the player must perform reality checks to avoid dooming themselves by, for example, following a promising trail that isn\u2019t actually there.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Cameron Schiff - Game Designer, 3D Modeler, Animator\r\n</p>\n<p>Arjun Gambhir - Producer, UI Programmer, Shader &amp; VFX Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Hudson Yang - Level Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>Anthony Herrera - 3D Modeler, 2D Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Reggie \u201cMrWalls\u201d Paredes - Systems Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Joe Warren - AI Programmer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T09:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61a9a1d3c5db510faa56aac65d315b46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
