One player plays all the hexes of one color and the other player plays all the hexes of the other color. The first player begins by claiming 1 empty hex for their color.<br/><br/>2. Starting with the second player, each player must claim 1 or 2 hexes on their turn.<br/><br/>3. If the largest group of hexes at the end of a turn is larger than the largest group of hexes at the beginning of that turn (regardless of color), the next player may claim up to 3 hexes on their turn. (This does not apply after the first player claims a single hex in step 1 above.)<br/><br/>4. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest group wins. If the players\u2019 largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren\u2019t the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.<br/><br/><br/>Catchup is an original Board Game designed by Nick Bentley.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/392ede8bc1c33712b95b4babbf50e173_TrCC8bp.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Grider"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Martin Grider"], "esrb_rating": null}
