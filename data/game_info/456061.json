In this version you can fully customize your rocket's colors and patterns, and modify height and launch time without the hassle\u00a0of calculations weighing you down.</p>\n<p>Editing your explosions is more fluent, doing away with the restrictive 7x7 grid and replacing it with a canvas you can draw on with the mouse, along with the ability to choose from the color palette you created, or let the sparks choose their own color at random.</p>\n<p>Firework Simulator Classic was built as a chemistry project, and thus had to follow a rubric that restricted the possibilities and menus, but now that it's been\u00a0redone as a personal project, everything is now totally in your hands.</p>\n<p>Have fun building rockets, and if this discussion board feature works the way I think it will, you can share pictures and videos of your rockets with other people who have the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:12:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a51/a51db1e1f2c84f1d3f357de696317139.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Kevster Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
