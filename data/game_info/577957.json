This is a game where every wrong move can cost you your life. This is a game where all living things hate the player. Can you reach the end? The game took 2 months to create. It's definitely the best thing I've ever done. I hope you enjoy this cruel, pain-filled world. Have a nice game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:26:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c47e519b7c9e1119a92a6327867cb4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BotEgorchik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
