But not everyone is happy to follow the rules and the long-lasting age of peace is coming to its end.<br/><br/> <strong>Corvus</strong> is a magus living in the harsh desert. His people are at war with another clan that also believes to be chosen by Pyros the fire god. Corvus finds a way to invade the distant land of the northerners, where his clan could gather resources to fuel the war effort.<br/><br/>As the two fundamentally opposed cultures meet, great conflict emerges.
