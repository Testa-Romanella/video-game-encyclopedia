So listen closely!<br/><br/>The illustrations by award-winning artist Gabriella Sperotto constitute the background for an acoustic journey through the various game levels. With each level, the difficulty increases, so even experienced listeners will be challenged. When one level is mastered, two more are unlocked.<br/><br/>When all levels are mastered, a special bonus will wait for the player: the bonus level is exceptionally tricky and thus can also be played by four players. Another surprise in the bonus level will not be revealed here!<br/><br/>Are you an attentive listener? Then you will have a lot of fun with SoundMemo!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b4/3b47e88a5e94a59a8b9a67b0f7e0995b.jpg", "website": "http://www.soundmemo-app.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mixtvision Mediengesellschaft mbH"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Mixtvision Mediengesellschaft mbH"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
