I'm uploading it here to share it with other people who entered the competition.</p>\n<p>In Lost Reality you are a man lost in a strange testing lab. You are given the ability to shift between dimensions, providing a new perspective on the level. Your task is to complete each level and find your way to the exit.</p>\n<p>There are currently 5 playable levels in the game, which go over the basic mechanics for the game.</p>\n<p>To quit the game, hit escape on the main menu. You can press 'R'/'Select' to restart a level if you get stuck (this can happen), and you can hit escape/'Start' to return to the main menu. The game has controller support (tested on USB Xbox 360 controller), but you will have to navigate the end-of-level menu's with a mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901e08588634be14c4a099b021b7b034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DChapmanTSU"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
