It is surrounded by a protective wall called the Aurora, visible from many kilometers away, that illuminates the night sky. The official languages are Aurorian and English. Northland is always covered in snow and seldom has warm days.</p>\n<p>Entering Northland you will travel through special Gates that go through the Aurora barrier.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>First, you will go to the airport of your origin, get through a Gate that takes you to a place in the Balkans (it looks like a train station! But without trains\u2026) and go through a second Gate that takes you directly through the Aurora and into Northland, in the Middle Frontier region, a town called Kolonata. There are no other entry points. If you carry any electronics, keep in mind the Gates will drain them, so be sure to have chargers!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This game is a collaboration between\u00a0Nathaniel Oldrin\u00a0and\u00a0somewherewithstories.
