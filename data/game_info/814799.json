Not since espionage went digital and assassinations became officially uncool.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re planning a heist, you could do a lot worse than add a ninja to your crew.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the starting point for Ninja Heist, a classic, super tough platformer from two-person development team RatonTour.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The aim in Ninja Heist is, of course, to steal stuff. More specifically, you need to steal coins and deposit them, all the while avoid a drone that\u2019s hovering in pursuit.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Each stage takes place on a single-screen map, with girders that you can leap on to collect loot and evade the deadly drone.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The core gameplay will be familiar to pretty much anybody who has ever played a platform game. It harks right back to the early arcade days of Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands, and Lode Runner.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And like those games, Ninja Heist is as hard as nails. The drone is absolutely unrelenting in its quest to take you down, and if you pause for a single second to catch your breath you\u2019re toast.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Not only that, but if you run the wrong way, or leap onto the wrong platform, you\u2019ll quickly find yourself out of options as the drone bears down on you with murderous intent.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Between attempts you can visit the in-game shop to spend your swag on boosts to the amount you can carry and the speed at which you move, as well as cosmetic changes to your larcenous little avatar.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are currently two modes in Ninja Heist: The City, and Outer Space. They play very differently, due to gravitational physics, but they require patience, concentration, and a supernatural degree of skill.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>More are in the post, too, with Volcano, Oriental, and Dungeon all set to be added to the game in the near future. They\u2019ll all introduce new skins, perks, and gameplay features.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can get started with Ninja Heist\u2019s existing two modes by downloading it for free right now on the Google Play Store. and will be released on IOS soon.<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>(we would like to hear more from users as to how we can improve this game, feel free to leave a review and tell us what you love and would like to see in upcoming updates.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58f58671a8695e231f81ed370bb28f56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ellisjames20061", "RatonTour"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
