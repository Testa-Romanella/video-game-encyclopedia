Through different puzzles, a lover tries to reconnect the story of his lover. In a drawer, you connect paperclips, pens to post-its, and a letter opener to a letter inviting you to a party. In a field of grass, ants circle around feet of two people having their slightly anxious first picnic. What forces make two people join together? From level to level you discover the thread of their first meeting, falling in love, fights and making-up, and eventually the accident that turned his life upside down. Looking back, the protagonist grasps at the points in memory to keep their story (and maybe himself?) alive. But memory seems fallible - different parts of life blend together. Gnu\u2019s and Boeings compete at beer pong. A dinosaur keychain starts eating away at a photo in summertime. A gravitational game about joining together elements, people and even tunes, and in the end, falling apart, holding on to the joints that once held together a union.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/213/2131e9c54b97f62aaf4866135eccd9c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JorisAlbeda"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
