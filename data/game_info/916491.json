With new moves and more challenging levels, you'll need to make decisions. Where to jump? Which way to go? Should I go on or fall? Which balloon to choose? Take your intuition to the extreme. Whatever you decide, your fans will support you. Even if you choose the wrong one, they'll applaud you, after all, they're your fans (and they paid for the tickets). Run, jump, slide and travel through the balloons to cross the tables and complete your challenge. Good luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T02:41:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e8b799455858fc5ee8969f5ccd747a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Buck"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["One Buck"], "esrb_rating": null}
