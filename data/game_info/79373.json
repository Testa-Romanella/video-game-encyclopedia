After detaching it is usually the opposite. <br/>It all depends on how you decide to split your money on upgrades. <br/>If you run out of fuel, you're given an opportunity to self destruct or you can hope to collect more money on your way down.<br/>That is just about all you need to know. You can reset your profile by pressing reset button in options. <br/><br/>In options you can also disable sound, vibrations and game instructions.<br/><br/>If you like Moon Expedition leave a rate and review.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/43641db35c30bef389f4bddc128ae8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Roman Pusnik"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Roman Pusnik"], "esrb_rating": null}
