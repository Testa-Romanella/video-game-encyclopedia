The long lonely walk across these hallways is supposed to represent how awful it feels to be alone. The windows show the people I wanted to interact with, but couldn't. I can see them, but there's something stopping me. The doors represent overcoming the obstacles of socializing as I move from talking with friends in school to actually hanging out with them. The final room represents romance and how even when I put in the work it was unacheivable. Falling through the floor shows tries to greatly increase the feeling of loneliness. </p><p>The main problem when making this game coding wise was the controls. I didn't know how to make a first person character controller exactly, so I kept trying new things and fixing them. I eventually landed at needing to use linear algebra to alter vectors received from inputs. This took me quite a while, as I never learned linear algebra. After a lot of work I finally got it working. I'm pretty sure there is an easier to implement it, but I got so into figuring it out I didn't even look for other options. The other main struggle was creating art assets. I can make 2D art assets pretty well, but I have never really used 3D modeling before. At the beginning I was struggling to make the most basic of objects, but by the end I think I started making objects look a lot better. Unfortunately, the objects I made towards the end were less important, but I think the practice is still really useful. </p><p>With more time I think I would like to make a lot more art assets. I didn't have time to make nearly as good art as I made. I would like to have made more detailed scenes and redone the models for the people. I also would've liked to make the main hallway have some objects in it. I also would've liked to make the keys and doors a bit better of a metaphor, but everything I thought of seemed either too real or it did not make sense. I think trying to hone down that aspects thematically would help the game a lot. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6b879ec42553d9111e5a0cb067b734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sam Leiman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
