{"id": 719569, "slug": "dream-sugar", "name": "Dream & Sugar", "name_original": "Dream & Sugar", "description": "<p>Bennett is a quiet, thoughtful young man. He is thoughtful, passionate, and kind-hearted, but not always sure of himself. Generally he isn\u2019t one to start a conversation, but get him talking about writing and Bennett has more than enough to say. When speaking about his passion (writing), Bennett is more sure of his opinions than on other topics. He\u2019s hesitant with new people but a solid friend who will try to put others before himself. His biggest weakness is trying to please everyone, especially his parents, and rectifying that with the fact that his dream is to be a professional writer of erotic fiction.</p>\r\nRiley LaRue\r\n<p>Riley knows where she wants to go in life and is here to achieve her goals. She\u2019s the life of most parties she walks into and knows how to work a room. Confident, witty, and empathetic, Riley gives off the impression that she knows how to adult and she\u2019s ready to tackle the challenge. Currently working at Brewtiful Coffee to fund her dreams of being a fashion designer, Riley has no doubts that she\u2019ll reach her goals with enough dedication, hard work, and networking. She puts effort into her appearance and her friendships, but that leaves her open to deeply felt treacheries when someone hurts her. Generous with her time and talents, Riley\u2019s biggest weakness is when her personal connections turn sour; she carries that hurt deeply and will brush aside other people\u2019s attempts to help her with it.</p>\r\nHugo Sterling\r\n<p>Hugo oozes \u201ccool kid\u201d vibes. He\u2019s funny, determined, and outgoing, readily able to joke with strangers and friends alike. Recently, he\u2019s stepped up as the manager of his high school band who are trying to move into the professional realm. He uses his charm and jokes to hide the fact that he has no idea what he\u2019s doing and that terrifies him. His biggest struggle is believing that he\u2019s truly the right person for this job, and feeling like he\u2019s floundering. To those who know him best, Hugo does have a vulnerable side, which he only shows to his closest friends.<br/></p>\n\r\nRating &amp; Content:\r\n<p>The demo contains Suggestive Themes and\u00a0Language as described by the ESRB.<br/></p>\n<p>The final game is intended for a teen audience.<br/></p>\r\nLicense &amp; Credits:\r\n<ul><li>Ren'Py:\u00a0https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/license.html<br/>\n</li><li>Audio &amp; SFX: https://www.zapsplat.com/license-type/standard-license/</li><li>Soundscape:\u00a0daveincamas at FreeSound https://freesound.org/people/daveincamas/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T09:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b899488941931697bf646302af5181a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Couch Lion Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
