Go on an exciting journey through 4 unique areas trying to collect as many coins as you can, as fast as you can, without dying! This game was made as a part of the One Button Game Jam here on itch.io, and this was the game I made for it.</p><p>The only control used is the Space bar. Initially you use the Space bar only to jump, but as you progress through the game you will unlock new abilities, but still only with the Space bar.</p><p>All art assets, programming, and sound effects made by Alex McGee.</p><p>Music by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><ul><li>Bit Shift</li><li>Blip Stream</li><li>Overworld</li><li>Kawai Kitsune</li><li>Cyborg Ninja</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d3/9d330ac93a848ee275dfb808174fde64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krimm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
