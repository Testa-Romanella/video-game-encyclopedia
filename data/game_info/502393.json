My name's Chris, and I'm so excited to tell you about my game! It\u2019s a \u201890s-inspired adventure platformer about the totally normal adventures I went on as a chubby kid back in 1995 - traveling the world, learning useful abilities, and, naturally, getting kidnapped and turned into a balloon by cartoon villains. Thankfully, I escaped and learned to use my transformation as a kind of superpower. I got to learn all kinds of cool stuff - how to throw fireballs and lightning, how to bounce around like a basketball and rocket around the earth. It's a neat story...I think. I really hope you'll enjoy it - I had a lot of fun making it!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Uncover a sinister story in a quirky, cartoon-like universe.</li><li>Explore 9 locations around the world in any order you please, plus the Kingdom of Lost Balloons and more!</li><li>Build Chris from a weak kid into the ultimate hero by upgrading him with unique special moves and abilities that you can customize to your style.</li><li>Learn (or purchase) increasingly powerful spells and techniques.</li><li>Battle bizarre villains across the globe, including samurai cats, cyborg penguins and whiny vampires.</li><li>Float or fall through unique platforming challenges.</li><li>Two additional full game modes, including bonus content - a more difficult and humorous Mean Mode, and Developer Commentary.</li><li>A variety of unlockable content and secrets to discover, including an in-depth backstory.</li><li>Numerous difficulty settings, including \"Ridiculously Easy\" for players who prefer to never die, and \"Hard for No Reason\" for crazy people.</li><li>Snort out loud with a game chock-full of laughs.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/165d072959f7223a372eb570cd899390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Graffiti_Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
