Your laser takes time to build up a head of steam, so check your pressure gauge in the top-left corner. The higher the pressure, the more damage your attack will do, but once you start firing, there's no way to stop until the pressure has been released.</p>\n<p>Cogsworth and her hat robots are vulnerable once every ten seconds: Strike when their head glows red for massive bonus damage!</p>\n<p>The castle's defenders will staunchly stand their ground. Search for clouds of <em>Healing Steam</em> to recover from the injuries they inflict upon you!</p>\n<p>If you decide Blimpula's not worth the trouble, <strong><em>the escape key will abort your attempt, suddenly and without warning</em></strong>.</p>\n<ul><li>Created using Godot.</li><li>3D assets designed using Blender</li><li>Textures drawn using Aseprite and Krita</li><li>Music made with GarageBand and Bosca Ceoil</li><li>Uses the \"Nickelodeon NF\" font by Nick Curtis</li><li>Sound effects generated with bfxr</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:57:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f6/8f6fcb24b1fa556084277701634c63a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["squimmy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
