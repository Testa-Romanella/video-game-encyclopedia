In the game, you are stranded on the surface of Mars due to a catastrophic accident. You will learn how to solve basic to more complex Algebra problems in your pursuit to escape Mars, but danger lurks around every corner. Armed soldiers are patrolling the facilities and will shoot you on site; there is also an army of corrupted cybernetic killer robots hunting for you. Your goal is simple: find a way to escape Mars alive. You will have to use your arsenal of weapons to fend off heavily equipped soldiers, as well as the cybernetic killer robots. You will also have your trusty weaponized rover to guide you across the red planet. The Mars landscape is 4x4 miles, so have fun exploring. Hint, great rewards will be yielded to one that is adventurous. The goal of the game is to create a comfortable, relaxing, and fun learning environment for students.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIMPORTANT: This is a BETA build of Project Skylab 3: A New Frontier. I am a college student and the sole developer of this game. The game still needs some work, but it is a MASSIVE improvement over Project Skylab 2. I have read all your feedback in regards to Project Skylab 2, and have implemented to the best of my abilities the suggested changes and improvements. I am incredibly grateful to you the players for all of your incredible support! I hope you enjoy this new game! Any feedback is much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheers!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a44f9713176a1ff5d315cffc7bfd6356.jpg", "website": "https://www.differentgamestudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Different Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Different Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
