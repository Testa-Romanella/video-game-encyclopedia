Thank you for the support you've shown to me everyone! Share this game with your friends and compete with them on who can finish it faster. But don't let them peak in your screen. Try to beat your own time. For now you have to write your score down, until I'm able to write a leaderboard.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFixes:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where vanishing plates would go mad and dissapear and reapear all the time.</li>\n<li>Fixed Cursor not showing up on different situtations, like <strong>Death, Escape Menu, Finishing</strong></li>\n<li>Fixed Quit Game button at the Start Menu</li>\n<li>Secret Door now let's you finish the Second Level faster.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where unlocking one of the two doors on the second level would make the other not able to unlock.</li>\n<li>Various UI fixes.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tFor the next Update:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>I'm planning to create the controls for the game in the loading screen.</li>\n<li>Create UI elements for interactable objects such as Keypads and buttons.</li>\n<li>Maybe start building Level 3.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>I encourage anyone that finds a bug of the game to submit it either by sending me a message in person, or by writting in the comment area bellow.</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tI received over the past weeks very positive comments regarding my small game. You could easily tell me what you think, and how I should go into improving it the next couple updates, just comment below!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Thank you for your Support!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bbfd9ee4bcee179c529bc6a58613ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matthew Tsirides"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
