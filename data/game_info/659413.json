This series is a way to help me practice composing and audio implementation. My Learning Series is a schedule of challenges that are grouped together into groups. Each group contains a composition challenge and an audio implementation challenge designed to improve my skills at both. Each group is targeted at a specific technique used in game audio. As such, the music composed in one group will be used for the implementation challenge in the same group. The goal will be to post one challenge a week, or one group every two.<br/></p>\n<p>This first group is designed to practice the basics. The composing side is kind of a cheat as I didn't actually compose any new music for it, rather the time was spent putting the video together and organizing how to release these projects moving forward. The implementation project uses the demo reel music, but with the transitions done dynamically in FMOD. For a deeper dive into each, please read the Devlog associated with each project in this section! (if none exist for the implementation that's because I haven't released it yet)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b8fdc6bb0982ecdccfc8768969eb1db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyle Waldon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
