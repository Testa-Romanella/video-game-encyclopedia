The game's unique mechanics mainly focus around light, where you use a Fog-of-War like method to explore the level and find the exit, or the Prism. The entire level is invisible, except for a ring of light around your character, and certain enemies/objectives, giving a unique sense of difficulty to the game. There are many different levels to solve, with each level consisting of multiple colored Prism Fragments to collect that equal your score.</p><p>You are always free to make as many monetized videos on YouTube of Spectrum as you want, as long as you give credit!</p><p>Be sure to check out my GameJolt page, where you can see updates and other info about Spectrum!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd710b27b518b20a445734f638ce393a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gman0064"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
