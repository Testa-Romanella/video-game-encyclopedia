Make sure your plane is visible in the game window and you don't crash into any objects!</p>\n<p>This game was made in 1 Hour in a private Game Jam session with 2 other people, so forgive any bugs and missed considerations, such as having to reload the page to play again or the timer continuing despite losing. The theme we were given was \"wind\", so I made a game based on a airplane trying to survive for as long as possible in a strong wind that would push you back while you dodged objects.</p>\n<p>Made by: Matthew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:33:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f41a97e32533a9db191a587d60c4386.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Unity Impact"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
