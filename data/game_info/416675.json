I was at a loss for the initial design of the game and ended up going with a collision based interaction framework. I quickly learned that\u00a0Unity collisions are terrible, do not trust them. If I had more time I would make my own physics system or copy someone else's on Stack Overflow. Last night before the deadline I realized that the line widths for my hand drawn assets were all messed up. But the vibe and\u00a0the theme for the game is something I am proud of. For my next game I am focusing on a no collision based interaction, wish me luck and see you in three weeks.\u00a0</p><p>[x . x]\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90a/90a62112c3187d29734654d425b4f24a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
