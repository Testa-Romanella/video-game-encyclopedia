Good luck getting to the top, you'll need it!<br/><br/>Puzzles, combatants, earthquakes, wind storms, explosive traps &amp; more will stand in your way. Complete each island's requirement to ride a portal up to the next. The quicker you move &amp; the better your stats -- the better your prize will be.<br/><br/>The more damage you take, the easier it will be to be knocked off. Same goes for your enemies, whose eyes will grow redder from each hit.<br/><br/>... now what to do about that big mysterious ship?VR Support<br/><strong>If you have a VR headset &amp; tracked controllers,</strong> you can throw the bashers -- the harder the throw, the harder the knock! When landing a hit, extra bonus throws will be made for you.<br/><br/>StratoBash uses a hybrid \"dash teleport\" system to prevent nausea while still allowing the player to move. You can teleport to nearby locations &amp; enemy knocks will be applied as additional, forced teleports.No VR? That's OK!<br/><strong>If you do not have a VR headset,</strong> StratoBash is still completely playable with a mouse &amp; keyboard.Modding Support<br/>You can edit &amp; import your own models to help construct levels (by modifying the contents of the TerrainParts local directory). Also, you can rewrite the word puzzles (by modifying the Riddles/lines.txt file).
