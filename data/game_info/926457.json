You can <strong><em>speedrun</em></strong> it in 3 minutes or <strong><em>explore</em></strong> a bit more, solve the optional <strong><em>puzzles</em></strong>,\u00a0 discover all the changes I made for this new game or find <strong><em>secret</em></strong> rooms to discover the <strong><em>treasure</em></strong> that only the most capable Explorers get to marvel at.<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you don't like the <strong><em>colors</em></strong> of the <strong><em>menus</em></strong>, you can easily <strong><em>change</em></strong> them by editing the colorgradients of the saves on the File Select Screen (This might change other details aswell).<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>This game supports:</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls, PS5 Controller, PS4 Controller,\u00a0Xbox Series X Controller, Xbox 360 Controller.</p>\n<p>You can look up or\u00a0change the key assignment in the Options Menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Graphic settings:</strong></p>\n<p>If the game doesn't run with constant framerate your <strong><em>GPU</em></strong> might be overloaded. To solve this you can press \"3\" on your keyboard to switch to <strong><em>30 FPS-mode</em></strong>\u00a0 or/and slightly reduce the game speed. Press \"4\" to decrease <strong><em>Game Speed</em></strong> and \"5\" if you want to reincrease it. The framerate may also become unstable/jittery after shrinking or minimizing the window. Just press \"escape\" to switch back to fullscreen or press it twice when the game is already in fullscreen mode to <strong><em>resynchronize</em></strong> it.</p>\n\n<p>The music of this game is not mixed like pop music, the dynamic range comes across best over high quality headphones or sound systems. You can also use PC speakers but many details may be lost and the mix might sound unbalanced.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Since this game is supposed to test one thing or the other, it would be very helpful if you could assist me in the comment section.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Game\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Bobo The Cat</p>\n<p>Title Screen\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by\u00a0Curious</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/profile/something-something</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>In memory of F\u00e9licette</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>A heroine but most of all an innocent victim.</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T13:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fb/7fbfee1feaaa69645180cf66bbdbad92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobo The Cat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
