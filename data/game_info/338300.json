I decided to make my own game jams.\u00a0 I'm not good enough to participate in the official ones. I picked a random theme and gave myself 5 days. I plan to do it as often as possible and\u00a0I hope this will improve my skills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A theme for this week: <strong>No one can see you</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0<br/></strong>Move: Arrows or WASD<br/> - Visibility switch</p>\r\n - Add some time\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Goal:<br/></strong>You have to collect all coin before time runs out, but you are able to collect them only when you are invisible. Use \"visibility switcher\" to make you invisible for 5s.\u00a0 Don't forget that you can also collect some extra time but only when you are visible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun.\u00a0 \u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:53:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e63791724a532cf55f21d2d7de765759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["evusak2"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
