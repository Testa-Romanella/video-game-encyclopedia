Accompanied by relaxing nature sounds one should succeed in having fun in finding the simple-logic-solution-exit to the maze's and reach the old castle as how it was in old-school-games and require's one to think (bio)logic and memorize and use the minds-eye more then just checking out every pathway.  <br/><br/>In the past they knew the greatness of a king by the complexity of his mazes and castle more then by the size of his mazes and castle, as the complexity of the mazes made sure many wouldnt even be able to reach the king without proving themselves illuminated-worthy enough. The maze and castle of this king however are both great in complexity and size, can you reach the old castle - like ancient knights/princesses who have proven worthy, or will you end up lost in the maze, dwelling in darkness instead of becomming amazed and illuminated and able to have a clear-memorized-picture fromout the minds-eye. This game seeks to challenge, relax illuminate and amuse any participant.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T04:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e8/3e80868031f6f65bd3b22117a61a63dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[TQ]king"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["goodkarmagames"], "esrb_rating": null}
