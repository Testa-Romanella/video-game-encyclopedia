I feel like the\u00a0real place has a very culturally unique significance, I personally had a great time exploring it a few years ago. I've designed this environment to be experienced from a first person perspective, with the aim of allowing the player to be immersed in the same\u00a0kind of atmosphere as the real place.<br/><br/>(engine / photo comparison)<br/><br/><br/>The map is very extensive to explore with\u00a0shrine gates\u00a0laid out over the entire mountainside. I've tried to include a lot of variance in different parts of the mountain, with lots of points of interest to discover and many branching/intertwining paths to encourage you to make choices with your exploration. Take photos with the in-game camera, customize the soundtrack, walk around at your own pace. There is a checklist of locations to find as well as some hidden areas, and also a small ending.<br/><br/>I feel thankful that higher fidelity\u00a03d environments have become\u00a0more achievable by everyone, and not only AAA game developers. I had a blast creating this project and feel like it's really improved my skills with unreal engine. hope you enjoy exploring<br/>- Matt<br/><br/></p>\n<p>- Explore the Shrine in VR!\u00a0 ($4)<br/>If you own a VR headset, you can immerse yourself even more in the world with the VR compatible version I've built. I was happily surprised with how well the scene runs in virtual reality, the quality is almost on par with the desktop version and it still runs great. everything from the desktop version is here, only you explore using\u00a0teleportation with your motion controllers. Donate $4 or more to get access to this version,\u00a0\u00a0I'm looking to update it\u00a0soon with more features like locomotion walking and a physical in-game camera. <br/>*designed for oculus rift, compatible with all headsets<br/><br/>If you feel like giving some feedback or helping me improve the game, I made this short form to fill out.<br/>thanks in advance !<br/><br/>Check out my other exploration game set in New Zealand:<br/>https://cavesrd.itch.io/newzealand<br/><br/>If you can't donate, checking out my socials helps just as much.\u00a0<br/>follow me\u00a0@cavesrd\u00a0on instagram for info about new scenes<br/>scene showcases and music on\u00a0youtube\u00a0<br/>contact info and everything else on my\u00a0website<br/>mattcvsrd@gmail.com<br/><br/>I made this project on my own, using a couple of sources for some game assets, such as quixel megascans, the unreal marketplace, and the book of the dead demo by unity.<br/>The music was selected from some of my favourite artists, you can find all of their info in the game menus, including spotify links.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/057e7869ecbb7c0363b9d0669691dd07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 330, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["caves rd"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
