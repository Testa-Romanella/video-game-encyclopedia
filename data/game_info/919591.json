Survive as long as you can in the dungeons of Snake Eyes Castle, using your wits to lure evil monsters into the depths below.</em></p>\r\nGAME OVERVIEW\r\n<p>The game consists almost exclusively of this simple three step turn,</p>\n<ol><li>The Player can move once a turn.<em>\u00a0</em><ol><li><em>(Or use any amount of Dice Items they have)</em></li></ol></li><li>Then all the Enemies move once towards the player.</li><li>Finally each tile that was stepped off will reduce in life.</li></ol>\n<p>Using this cycle you can methodically burn tiles away to create pits, dangerous to you but essential to surviving, as luring enemies into these pits are the only way to slay them.</p>\n<p>Every time the player slays an enemy, they will be given a Dice, stored in their Inventory in the right-hand side of the screen. Using the (A) and (B) buttons, the player can choice to use their most recent dice to either heal or hurt every die that has the same value as said item.</p>\n<p>After an amount of turns, More enemies will spawn and destroyed tiles will reappear, these events will happen more and less often the longer the round so try your best to overcome the overwhelming amount of enemies you must defeat to earn your best scores.</p>\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW\r\n<p>Die Castle is a small Pico-8 title programmed in lua that I created in a single week. \r\n</p>\n<p>While trying to improve my portfolio I wanted to gain experience working on smaller projects so I could broaden my game development skills while also being better at communicating with different disciplines. After talking about this desire with some colleagues it was suggested that I try making a small game in Pico-8, This was to enforce a limited scope while also making me use lua for the first time which would be my first time using a programming language other than C# which I am self taught in.</p>\n<p>For this project I wanted to make a spin off a small but classic core game mechanic, in the same lane as other recent indie games such as \"Shotgun Chess\", \"Tetris 99\" &amp; \"Peglin\". The game I wanted to spin off is Club Penguins \"Thin Ice\" minigame and it's gameplay centered around moving on and off tles that slowly decrease in health.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits available on portfolio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T19:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f35/f356f6815a719b9880adb1d79e09462a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["btbgbstpl"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
