A small Special Forces unit led by Specialist Ethan Cole of the HAZMAT (hazardous materials) Division is sent to investigate. As Cole, players will delve into five massive levels within the confines of Area 51, discovering a deadly mutagenic side effect of the virus that controls the minds of those infected, as well as an ancient alien colony buried beneath the facility. With a multitude of human and alien weapons, players must explore chilling conspiracies such as the extraterrestrial crash at Roswell and the faked lunar landing, in order to solve the enigma of Area 51 before the viral mutagen is released and irrevocably mutates all life on Earth.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2005-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-17T21:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd19bd0346f55a4ec2c758685a9be7d.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 32, "beaten": 80, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 18}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 63, "suggestions_count": 535, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 63, "platforms": ["Xbox", "PC", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Mock Science", "Pixel Mine", "Midway Studios - Austin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Midway Games", "Midway Home Entertainment", "Noviy Disk", "Success", "Midway Home Entertainment.inc"], "esrb_rating": null}
