To make it a life like experience, some \r\nsounds are triggered random and/or are randomized in pitch, volume and \r\nin space. Different Roll off curves, that changes the volume amount of \r\nan object when it passes the player, have been used.  The music also \r\ninteracts on the movement of the player. Different parts of the music \r\nare triggered ones the player walks deeper in to the virtual world. The \r\nsame audio concept used in this demo can be used for VR purposes. On \r\nsome browsers the Trailer gives an error message. Please press continue \r\nwhen that happens. You can rotate with your mouse and move with the \r\narrow buttons on your keyboard. Have fun!</p>\n<p>Audio powered by Fabric.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/562/5628db69442176ad9156284ca72c0cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FinishingMove"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
