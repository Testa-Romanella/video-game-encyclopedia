On your turn, you must place one token of <strong>either color</strong>. If you are Order, you win when there are 5 pieces with the same color in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on either player's turn. If you are Chaos, you win by preventing the Order player from completing their objective. If the board becomes full and Order has not won, the game ends and Chaos wins.</p>\n<p>Reminder: You may play tokens of either color</p>\r\n\r\nNote: Some times \"copy link\" doesn't work on Chrome.
