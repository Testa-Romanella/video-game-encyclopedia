You only have 5 minutes to kill the evil necromancer who has attacked the village.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have time, you will die.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:<br/></strong>1) <strong>Time is your life.</strong>\u00a0 Fight with the undead, complete the task and do everything to replenish the reserves of constantly failing health.<br/>2)<strong>Dynamic gameplay</strong> - each movement must be verified and calculated. Every second is expensive, and the price of error is even more expensive.<br/>3) <strong>Explore, explore and explore again</strong> - explore the world of Time Hero, discovering new, hidden mechanics. But so little time!</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s ironic that the time game was made in 48 hours at the Hackathon. The efforts were not in vain. Time Hero not only allowed us to win, but also gave an impetus to continue development. There are a lot of plans and now we need <strong>your support!</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Your help will give us the opportunity to continue development!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f4daa807f3d70b910b34898b19c42d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rassdev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
