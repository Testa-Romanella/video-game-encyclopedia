{"id": 218274, "slug": "iaggravation-lite", "name": "iAggravation Lite", "name_original": "iAggravation Lite", "description": "The game iAggravation Lite is a marble board game for 1 to 8 players.  Multi-player play is done by sharing a single device (iPod, iPhone or iPad).  The objective is to advance all of your marbles around the board to your home position from the base position.  Marble movement is based on the roll of two dice.  Landing on your opponents marble sends it back to their base position.  The player type can be human or computer.  There are selectable variations: one die, two dice, blockade, back four, corners, automatic modes.  This lite version has most of the game modes as full version but without the multiple marbles and board options.  No statistics nor gravity mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/692/69265621e5aa744b9b677b63e788b31e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Millhouse Engineering"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["John Millhouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
