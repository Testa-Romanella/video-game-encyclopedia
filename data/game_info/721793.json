The puzzles of this Warehouse Keeper clone\u00a0are taken from the popular Microban II levelset created by David W. Skinner. They should be easy enough for beginners to deal with, but challenging enough for advanced players to not get bored while following the short story.</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>\n\n<p>PS:\u00a0I'll try to release a short game every month in 2022. If you want to support this project, feel free to click the donate button above, recommend this game or\u00a0be one of my first Patrons. Thanks :)</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way: if you like warehouse puzzles and if you search for a huge and mobile friendly collection, check out Chibiban for Android smartphones in GooglePlay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T07:13:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7c/d7ce7986b36e204caeafa654a32cbee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eimie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
