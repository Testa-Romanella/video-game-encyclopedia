No stupid retro graphics, no artsy \"innovation\", no bullshit. Just an honest PC game with fun in mind.</p><p>\r\n\tThere are no saves. Once you use up your checkpoints the game is over.</p><p>\r\n\tUpgrades and bonuses help you. Bonuses are picked up automatically if you touch them. Upgrades, however, need to be confirmed, because they replace your previous upgrade.</p><p>\r\n\tThe controls are displayed inside the game.
