It has revealed its name, Cynical Anti Cacti Automated Weaponry, or CACAW for short. It\u2019s rather pissed it seems, and really sorry for you at the same time. It\u2019s apparently been trying to wake you for a while now. It\u2019s really bipolar for a floaty robot though. Perhaps the cold got into its\u2026 Circuits? Chips? </p>\n<p>Well anyways, it informs you that you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, and you\u2019ve got to survive for about ye long before it\u2019s able to compute how to get off from this place. Good news, it\u2019s not a horror game, and you don\u2019t have a hunger bar to keep topped up. Bad news, this place is home to some of the worst and fluffiest cacti in the world. Why are there Cacti in the snow? Why are the cacti fluffy and not prickly? I don\u2019t know either buddy. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, CACAW can turn into a gun and shoot tiny anti cacti pellets and also say bang while doing so. It mentions that if you collect enough cacti essence it should also be able to unlock some other weaponry to help survive the cold, I mean cacti. You\u2019ve got nothing for the cold unfortunately, save your fur, though at least it won\u2019t kill you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T18:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/764/764665b9c186d25ff45ae6eb41f49eea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sierpinski Simon", "Pixelartchemist {Onion Licks}", "Jiririn", "Ra_Ivl", "OutcastT2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
