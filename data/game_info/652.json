However, as you would expect in a world run by cabals, it\u2019s not quite that simple. There are also 3 alliances between the cabals that allow advanced mixed deck permutations, not to forget the neutral cards that can be included in the deck of any cabal.<br/><br/><strong>Primal Alliance</strong><br/><br/><ul>A shamanic group that mixes Slavic mythologies with weird psychoanalytic mind control techniques. Allied with forces of arctic nature they are believed to be operating out of the western reaches of the Soviet Union.</ul><br/><br/><ul>Consists of aristocratic Irish witches and subterranean faerie folk. Celtic folklore meets Arthurian legends with means of buffing themselves and transforming tiles into gates to the underground.</ul><br/><strong>Dominion Alliance</strong><br/><br/><ul>Esoteric engineers applying modern scientific methods to their worship of an energetic principle force. Underground power plants, somewhere in Southern Germany, manufacture their massive, unstable and risk taking Hyperborean cyborgs!</ul><br/><br/><ul>Versed in Medieval alchemy and Arabic wisdom, these apprentices look to attain total mastery over matter. Their magic brings extra cards and resource manipulation from their laboratories thought to be hidden in Southern Spain.</ul><br/><strong>Nether Alliance</strong><br/><br/><ul>Brings much needed nobility that is missing from other cabals. A lethal combination of brutal dragon spirit, disruption and surprise culminate in their powerful origins of Eastern Asia.</ul><br/><br/><ul>Reaches out to ancient knowledge, astronomy and unimaginable strength that rarely leaves these dreadful priests empty handed. Their riches and ruthlessness originate from Northern Africa, allowing combinations of a deadly kind.</ul><br/><strong>Which side are you on?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dde2ce130fa6f6fed687fdd9c9ef647.jpeg", "website": "http://www.cabalsgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 121, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyy Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Kyy Games Oy", "Kyy Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
