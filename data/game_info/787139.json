BO)))NK is an exploration of what a sustained tone would look like as a melting, mutating, cartoony software toy.\u00a0<br/><br/>This project was made for the Drone jam 2022. It is a collaboration between Kjell H\u00e5ft\u00e9n and Oljudas. As is usually the case with jam games, there are things left unpolished and janky, but all in all it's a nice little trip.</p>\n<p>Controls are F and L (SPACEBAR for fullscreen // alt + F4 = terminate the program). Be patient and tune in to the droning sounds and images.</p>\n\n<p>With love, Kjell H\u00e5ft\u00e9n and Oljudas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T14:55:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/457/4578e357b491979b76e8c3569408d62f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kjell H\u00e5ft\u00e9n"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
