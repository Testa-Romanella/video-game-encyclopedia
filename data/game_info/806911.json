In this game, you collect gold in caves underwater which allow you to buy upgrades at the store. These upgrades make it easier for you to access more caves.</p>\n<p>Stars can also be found in the caves; When you have collected 6 stars, the game will end <em>(this is temporary until the game is further developed)</em>.</p>\n<p>I incorporated the limitation of \"You are your own enemy\" through the use of a sanity meter; As you go deeper into the water, your sanity drops too. The lower it gets, the higher the chance of hallucinations appearing which cause your player to run away against your will. This may push you deeper underwater, wasting your precious oxygen and leading to your demise.</p>\r\nPsst, it's open-source:\r\n<p>https://github.com/dev-rocco/nyctophilia-repo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T02:03:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27bd0bf5608005008ece7c744520d30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["rocco"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
