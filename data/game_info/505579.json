SURPRISE!</p>\n<p>Shootout sim is about a time travelling saloon shootout simulator enemy who goes on the ride of his life via a time portal and ends up in cyberpunk city (around year 2076 or so). He then proceeds to shoot the crap out of everyone because the cyber police want him arrested for time travel.<br/></p>\n<p>It's pretty buggy and the ragdolls are really laggy for some reason. But hehe it has a kickable gong in the bar level so it's a pretty good game because of that!!</p>\n<p>This prototype was made around 2014-15 and eventually turned into Ravenfield.</p>\n<p>It uses deferred rendering so that's how you know the grephics are good!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>- Lmb shoot hehe surprise<br/>- Rmb aim wow revolutionary<br/>- Space jump BUT if you press space again in mid air you do a cool dive move that makes you harder to hit<br/>- Ctrl or C to crouch, can't remember which one<br/>- E to pick up weapons<br/>- G to drop 'em again<br/>- F to use grapple hook beam thingy. Hold F to charge it for a bit which lets you leap forward like that unlockable move in the new spider man game.<br/>- Q to debug screen shake WAOW<br/>- P to restart the level<br/>- I probably for got one or two debug keys so try 'em all I guess<br/>- OHHH yeah if you press tab you get slow motion!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e58a6193025a24b2e9419eaa9f3e587.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SteelRaven7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
