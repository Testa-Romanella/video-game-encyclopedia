Instead of the normal, click button, get reward way most clicker games play out, this clicker requires its player to virtually buy a set amount of loot boxes before they can open any.</p>\n<p>As players continue through the cycle for purchase, open, collect, repeat, the game itself will slowly degrade with everything element of the game becoming less flashy / colourful.</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Nick Parker, Daniel Ackroyd and Jordan Szabo</p>\n<p><strong>Media Attributions:</strong></p>\n<p>Americans largely won't pay to win a video game \u2014 but Chinese gamers will</p>\n<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/pay-to-win-video-games-differences-between-us-and-chinese-gamers.html</p>\n<p>Pay-to-win mechanics popular in China but the West is not on board</p>\n<p>https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/67149/pay-to-win-mechanics-popular-in-china-but-the-west-is-not-on-board/</p>\n<p>The world spends US$109 billion on video games, and the Chinese are the biggest players</p>\n<p>https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-gaming/article/2099180/china-driving-global-video-games-market-record-us109b-2017</p>\n<p>$4,000+ for VIP Level 17 WTF Pay 2 Win Chinese Browser Games</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrNFvXVaUtI</p>\n<p>CrossFire: Tencent's Top Earning Free-to-Play Game You've Never Heard Of</p>\n<p>https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/01/20/crossfire-tencents-top-earning-free-to-play-game-youve-never-heard-of/#41145f06c6c2</p>\n<p>Is the buying of loot boxes in video games a form of gambling or gaming?</p>\n<p>https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/glr2.2018.2216?journalCode=glr2</p>\n<p>Video game loot boxes are linked to problem gambling: Results of a large-scale survey</p>\n<p>https://psyarxiv.com/7ntjk</p>\n<p>A Case Study on Loot Boxes in Two Video Games - A comparison between Overwatch and Star Wars Battlefront 2</p>\n<p>https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/30791/1/BSc_thesis_A_Case_Study_on_Loot_Boxes_in_Two_Video_Games_GTh_RFJ.pdf</p>\n<p>Predatory monetization schemes in video games(e.g. \u2018loot boxes\u2019) and internet gaming disorder</p>\n<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/add.14286</p>\n<p>Lootboxes and Gambling by TotalBiscuit (John Bain)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMDGPSWWA18</p>\n<p>TextMeshPro:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126</p>\n<p>Designed to deceive: How gambling distorts reality and hooks your brain:<br/>https://theconversation.com/designed-to-deceive-how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain-91052</p>\n<p>The GAAAmbling Problem (The Jimquisition)</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTitHF6-xlI&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>\n<p>Models inspired by Overwatch, Developed by Blizzard Entertainment</p>\n<p>https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee1917d5786c8d6c5cf68b7bef59781e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanielAckroyd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
