It's about how smart you need to be to avoid them, and what you're ready to do for that.OK,\u00a0that's\u00a0what\u00a0I\u00a0wanted the game to\u00a0be,\u00a0but\u00a0with\u00a0only\u00a07\u00a0levels\u00a0(including an intro cut scene), it's a little bit short to pretend being that.</p>\n<p>Also, be warned: this game has very bad graphics and sounds and it will hurt your eyes and ears. It also has alcohol and violence against objects. The level design is only slightly better and it's only because of  the last two levels that I say that. The reason for all this badness is partially because it somehow fits the theme of the game jam, but is mainly because of my lack of skills, time, and motivation to do better.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c15945a8a4d1d0f54d9cdd7d3f0a0af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Clement Sparrow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
