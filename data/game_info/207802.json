We came together purely for the love of video game development. Our team was comprised of two producers, three Unity engineers, one Unreal engineer, six game designers, two graphics designers, and one sound engineer (some people wore multiple hats). We met at 11:00 am and developed this game until 11:00 pm.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Developer Comments</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Tara Nguyen: \"I don't have much to comment on but I thought we did a great job, had fun, and worked well together I used Procreate to draw the sprites and story scenes.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>Thomas Case: \"Same as Tara, nothing really extra to say. We were pretty much all newcomers and I'm really proud of our game. I had a great time and hope to see everyone at more events!\"</p>\n<p>Chris Nguyen: \"Comment: my team was fucking rad, fun, and flexible. Tools: OneNote and too many ideas.\"</p>\n<p>Chris Zapata: \"Amazing spirit and cohesive team. Everyone contributed and we finished a game in less than 12 hours!\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Scrappy Misfits\n<ul><li>Thomas Case - Producer / Programmer / Designer\r\n</li><li>Chris Nguyen - Game Designer\r\n</li><li>Tara Nguyen - Character Art / Designer</li><li>Me (Chris Zapata) - Producer / Sound\u00a0/\u00a0Designer\r\n</li><li>Kristi ??? - Animator / Programmer\u00a0/\u00a0Designer\r\n</li><li>Jared ??? - Level Design / Designer</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Release Date\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li>July 15th, 2018\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Platforms</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Windows</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Number of Developers</strong></p>\n<ul><li>6</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Length of Development</strong></p>\n<ul><li>12 hours</li><li>July 15, 2018</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Budget</strong></p>\n<ul><li>$0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lines of Code</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 881 Lines of Written Code</p>\n<p><strong>Development Tools</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity 3D</li><li>Procreate</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Google Drive</li><li>Discord</li><li>OneNote</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/3981b6efd0209effc43a5cf55becf967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["czapata"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
