This is a bullet hell game with lots of lasers, lightning, and explosions. Move with WASD or arrows.\u00a0 This game does not have an ending, it is endless. Though, I am making a full version (probably) where there COULD be an ending. (Also, don't try to no-hit it. You can't.)</p><p>This is my first Scratch-turned-HTML project. I know there are some issues, but I will figure those out later. After all, it's a game jam. I'm supposed to be trying new things.</p>\n<p>If you like this game, please sub to my youtube channel.\u00a0 ImSideen in the search bar.
