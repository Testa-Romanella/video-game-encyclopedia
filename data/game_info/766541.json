Their eventual escape is inevitable, but it's your job to delay that time as long as possible!</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to click, drag, and hold each prisoner to keep their mythological torture working. It's up to you to figure out how to interact with each torment and keep them all functioning for as long as possible. As time goes on, everything speeds up, so keep your wits about you to manage them all!</p>\n<p>CHANGELOG: Fixed a bug where the scaling on the start menu and game over screen made it impossible to see everything.
