I've been working on it a ton recently and this is proper playable demo.</p>\n<p>It's still missing some animations and sound effects, as well as a few placeholder sprites, but it's finished enough for people to give it a try. 20 stages in this demo.<br/></p>\n<p>Mushroom Office Lady Blotti is late for work and needs to get there on time! Earn medals from both doing stages quickly and from doing acts without resetting too many times! <br/></p>\n<p>Check out Crezno, who did the music and sound effects!</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/creznohip</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/FriendCrezno</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Crezno</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T09:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d716951aa10db469ab04bbb99432628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krabbshack"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
