For example, your main cannons may start firing non stop, or your ship may be sent into a wild spinning motion.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to survive your trip through space and then defeat the boss awaiting you at the end. But stay on your toes, as you get closer to your goal, you may find more of your systems going haywire at once. Best of luck!</p>\n<p>- Owen</p><p>(P.S. If you encounter any GUI scale issues, I believe in most cases entering full screen mode should fix it. Sorry about that!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Son of a Rocket by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4391-son-of-a-rocket<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p><strong>SFX Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Flash\u00a0Animation\u00a0Sound\u00a0by\u00a0BlastwaveFx.com<br/>Link:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/602-Flash-Animation.html<br/>License:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:10:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3b/b3bf447f1457955ad37035d71ba80031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
