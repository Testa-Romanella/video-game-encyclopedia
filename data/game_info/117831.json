Relaxed, tile-based puzzle game about trying to mow the lawn as efficiently as possible so you can no longer be mowing the lawn. Be careful not to bang the mower into the concrete, but the character can walk on it!</p>\n<p>The number in the bottom-right corner is a par time that you can achieve (ie. the quickest number of moves I've managed to do that level in. Let me know if you do it in less!).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This version of the game has 14 levels. I want to add some more types of tiles and make it look more like a neighbourhood with each level a different back yard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - move mower in that direction, or turn the mower.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys + space - pivot around the player</p>\n<p>Esc - exit to level select screen (again to exit game).</p>\n<p>At present you have to wait a bit on the menu select screen before you can select a level. This is because of some hacky code.</p>\n<p>Windows build untested.</p>\n<p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #19 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4a0e26889c4527dc85922d9493fdcf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
