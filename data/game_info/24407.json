Go for 1st place or a high score!<br/>Art Style: \n      light trax takes racing to whole new (and very surreal) levels as you \n      control a white beam of light moving perpetually forward while your \n      viewpoint shifts between 2-D and 3-D perspectives.\n    </p><p>\n      Start by choosing one of the two main modes of game play, each with its \n      own distinct goal. In light tours mode, you vie with other light beams \n      for the most points in a three-course racing tour. Watch out for \n      obstacles, use items, and strategically use your dash ability to finish \n      first. In freeway mode, your objective is to set a high score by \n      traveling the greatest distance within a set amount of time. Mastering \n      the intricacies of each setting is crucial: you\u2019ll have to alternate \n      between them in order to progress through the game and unlock all of its \n      modes.\n    </p><p>\n      With precise controls packed in and a driving techno soundtrack, Art \n      Style: light trax offers an experience unlike any other. Are you ready \n      to compete in a mind-bending race at the speed of light?\n    </p><p>\n      Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics, \n      and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on \n      fun and engaging game play.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Check out more Art Style games!\n    </p><p>\n      For WiiWare:<br/>Art \n      Style: CUBELLO<br/>Art \n      Style: ORBIENT<br/>Art \n      Style: ROTOHEX<br/>Art \n      Style: Rotozoa\n    </p><p>\n      For DSiWare:<br/>Art \n      Style: AQUIA<br/>Art \n      Style: BOXLIFE<br/>Art \n      Style: DIGIDRIVE<br/>Art \n      Style: BASE 10<br/>Art \n      Style: precipice<br/>Art \n      Style: Zengage<br/>Art \n      Style: PiCTOBiTS\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc91615a2e9d55e3512ec0e71ac9fdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
