It is the sequel to Pumpkin Smashers, a game I released last year. While pumpkin smashers is a stealth game, I decided to switch things up for the sequel.</p>\n<p>Unlike Pumpkin Smashers, this game is action-packed with a fun and innovative experience. You upgrade your weapons, unlock different skins, destroy pumpkins, and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Left Mouse - Shoot/Select</p>\n<p>Space - Open the shop</p>\n\n<p>Not a visual novel but oh well</p><p>NOTE: The game is much less buggy when downloaded. Gamemaker Studio has some HTML bugs so if you want a better experience then download.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T18:35:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/52420d4f977fd6194fa94549a6d4b0b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Stopshut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
