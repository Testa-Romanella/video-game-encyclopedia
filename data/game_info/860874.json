You play as Bento, a man on his last day in jail where he spent the last few years working in a cowshed to reduce his sentence. As you pack your stuff, you will reminisce about your past life and what led you there.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>True Story:</strong> Relive Bento's unique tale when in prison\r\n</li><li><strong>It\u2019s all in the past:</strong> Observe old tools, mechanisms, and behaviors</li><li><strong>Take it easy: </strong>A relaxed interactive experience</li></ul>\r\nThe true story of Bento\r\n<p>In the late 1970s, Bento was sentenced to 20 years in Alcoentre prison. He would never complete the total time and Bento was out in 8 years due to his good behavior. While in prison, he attended special rehabilitation programs, that included taking care of a farm.     What you will play is his last day in the Alcoentre prison farm.</p>\r\nWhat was Bento\u2019s crime?\r\n<p>One day Bento decided to visit his nephew. <strong>When arriving he found that his beloved nephew was being attacked and stabbed by several men</strong>. Bento then ran to his house and\u00a0<strong>got himself a shotgun and when arriving he shot one of the attackers in the leg.</strong> That man would eventually die in the hospital.\r\n<strong>Since Bento got the shotgun at his own house, and not in the nephew's location</strong>, the judge considered that he <strong>had plenty of time to reflect on his intended action and it wasn\u2019t a rushed act</strong>. Bento was convicted for 20 years.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Walk</li><li>E - Interact</li><li>MOUSE 1 - Skip frase</li></ul>\r\nDeveloped by\r\n<ul><li>Miguel Feliciano - 3D Artist/Level Designer</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves\u00a0- Programmer</li></ul>\n<p>With contributions from:</p>\n<ul><li>Pedro Chitas - Game Design</li><li>Mariana Lampreia - Concept Art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T19:40:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726f69cea314f2fa4aa5262776835778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miguel Feliciano", "Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
