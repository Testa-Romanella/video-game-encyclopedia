This is almost the end of the 47th LudumDare session and it was cool. I really appreciated the main theme which has been chosen by the community - <strong>Stuck In A Loop</strong>. I did an experimental game - something weird. You can explore some non-Euclidean rooms, changing your gravity, enabling doors, passing through portals, etc - until you reach the core. You stuck in a loop because the main gameplay creates some 3d maze and (even for me sometimes) it is really hard to understand where we are. Try it, explore the basement - and find the core. There is a full explanation when you start a game. Thank you ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8ba5068dcb85212284d1cf01ba3fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
