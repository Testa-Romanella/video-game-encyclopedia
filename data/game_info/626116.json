{"id": 626116, "slug": "perseus-the-slayer-of-beasts", "name": "Perseus, The Slayer of Beasts", "name_original": "Perseus, The Slayer of Beasts", "description": "<p>The setting of the story is in Mycenae, which is a Bronze Age Greek civilization. The story takes place around late 14th century B.C., when the Hittites invaded present-day Greece. In these times, Greek warlords were heroes. Warriors received the highest praise by society and among each other. Perseus in greek mythology slew Medusa and a great sea monster named Cetus. The main character is named after this monster slayer, but this mortal has his own monsters to slay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reader starts as a young Perseus, going through training to be a hoplite of Mycenae. Him and the other boys are trained hard. The purpose of the interactions Perseus has with Euthymios and Linus were to give the reader advice that they could apply to their own life. Euthymios offers guidance on building interpersonal relationships and social skills. Both of which I feel young people of today struggle with as a result of so much separation. Linus gives advice on maintaining hygiene, fitness, and keeping skills sharp. He heavily emphasizes consistency and focus, which is hard nowadays with so much distraction. He also teaches concepts such as emotional stability and the ability of the human mind to manifest reality. These are taught in a warrior\u2019s context but are all concepts that anyone can apply to the betterment of their lives.</p>\n<p>The advice and lessons learned have another purpose as well. At the end of the story Perseus is faced with a challenge. He must think back on his training in order to overcome it. The reader is given choices throughout the story, but certain choices near the end determine the ending. The story up until this point will help the reader with information to decide the correct choices. These choices will determine if the character lives or dies. There are four different endings. All of which may be experienced; I implemented a feature to start the final challenge over again. I hope my story offers good advice and an entertaining experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/371e8213bd48fde733915309a1a03659.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vmc4"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
