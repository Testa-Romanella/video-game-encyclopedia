There are 5 levels, and you can choose between 4 different items that you can use to reach the ladders. You can also try it out without using any items.</p>\n<p>The items can be grouped in 2 ways: Single-Use vs Infinite-Use, Aggressive vs Defensive. You can have a Infinite-Use Aggressive item, that is the Club. It doesn't deal much damage, but you can use it as much as you like. The Single-Use Aggressive item is the Spear. You can only throw it once, but it kills everything in its path.</p>\n<p>The Infinite-Use Defensive item is the suit of Armor. You get extra health as long as you have it on. However you also walk 30% slower! The Single-Use Defensive Item is the Healing Potion, that instantly replenishes your health. This might be better in situations where speed is important.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made in 48 hours. Code, drawings and sound effects. It was made using the GODOT game engine.<br/></p>\n<p>You can look for yourself at the code and art here:<br/>https://github.com/KovaxG/GMTK2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db78173a115b81265a683ea96c7a1c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kovax"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
