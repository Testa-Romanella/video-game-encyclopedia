You can also destroy the actual world news too. Once all the clickbait has been destroyed, you will be shown the statistics of how many clickbait you destroyed, and how much news you accidently destroyed.</p><p>To run the program, you can try downloading the HoloLens emulator, we haven't actually tried that yet since we had the real thing to work with.</p><p>In the future, we will try to integrate some of our other assets, as a showcase of the assets that the rest of our team members made. The Holo Lens is very interesting as object placement changes for room to room, and you have to know how to scan a room, and use it's mesh data to help place your 3D objects.</p><p>Made by members of the Trent Game Dev Club (our site is down...)</p><p>https://www.facebook.com/groups/662422090562101/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/015d8f9c6b558f55b88b0a93571803c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrentGameDevClub"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
