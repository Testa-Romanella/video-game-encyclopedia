{"id": 955566, "slug": "godfist", "name": "Godfist", "name_original": "Godfist", "description": "Godfist combines slot/deck building with a unique twist. You start with three different abilities each will randomize every time you press one of the ability buttons. The ability that the slot lands on will be your next attack.<h3>Gameplay</h3><br/><strong>The tower and immortality</strong><br/>Godfist gameplay is inspired by the Super Smash Bros series in the sense that you don't lose health, but instead you gain pain. Every time you get hit, you become a little more unstable. Your objective is to climb the tower without falling off the edge and every hit will bring you closer to the edge. The same goes for your enemies, they cannot be killed by conventional means and must be thrown off the edge! So it's simple the more damage you do, the further the enemies will fly. Once they are knocked out of the stage they are gone.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Stage hazards</strong><br/>The world of Godfist is filled environmental hazards. Falling barrels and exploding lanterns can do massive damage if timed right.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Slot building</strong><br/>Godfist is all about building your own slot. Your character starts with three different abilities and three ability slots. Each time you activate an ability you'll also start the slot roll. The ability the slot stops in will be your next attack. During the course of the game you will find new abilities to build up your own custom slot  machine. But be careful, each roll will cost you a few gold pieces.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Unlockable classes</strong><br/>You start as the Hoplite, which is a well rounded class that combines both balanced speed and attack power. As you progress you will be able to unlock new characters with different starting abilities and stats.<br/><br/><strong>Leveling and upgrades</strong><br/>During battle enemies will drop both gold and experience, pick these up to buy upgrades and level up your character.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Hectic first person combat<br/></li><li> Slot building mechanics, build your own arsenal.<br/></li><li> 4 different characters with different stats and starting abilities.<br/></li><li> Procedural generated tower, every playthrough will be different.<br/></li><li> Leveling system that gives you different perks and will improve your survival rate.<br/></li><li> Challenging enemies, each with their own different quirk<br/></li><li> No health, only pain!
