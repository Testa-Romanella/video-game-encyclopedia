Let your imagination guide Koa: grow and cut enchanted branches to help him traverse his perilous path and free the spirits of Ekos from an insidious dark magic!<br/><br/>With 10 gorgeous levels to complete, each with a number of solutions bounded only by your imagination, you won't want to leave Ekos until you've freed every one of Koa's friends. And make sure to earn *Gold Stars* by beating each level with as few branches as possible - there might just be something in it for you...<br/><br/>Headphones recommended -- you won't want to miss the sounds of Ekos and our beautiful score!<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>As a featured game of the USC Advanced Games Program, Koa was student-directed and built in a studio-simulated environment, with top-tier student teams of programmers, producers, designers, marketers, usability experts, audio designers, animators and artists. Student Art Directors from Art Center College worked with the team remotely to define the unique look of the game, with additional UI, animation, and art support coming from Cal State Fullerton and others.
