Well, there are three levels, with four variations each. There are extra parts of each level that gets revealed in each new variation. The differences were there before, but you didnt notice them, causing them to lead\u00a0no significance, and therefore, did not interfere with the game. Each new variation, you look further into the game for details, revealing more and more of the level.\u00a0The differences were there before, just hidden in plain sight.
