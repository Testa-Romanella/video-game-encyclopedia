Well, specifically, a\u00a0<em>prototype</em> of a battle simulator. So, I guess, in a way, it's a\u00a0<strong>battle prototype. </strong>A terrific one at that.</p>\n<p><strong>Totally Terrific Battle Prototype\u00a0</strong>is a game all about throwing helpless units onto the screen and watching them fight to the death in a team-based deathmatch on a grassy, open field.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What's the main difference between this and TABS?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A:\u00a0TTBP is much much more performant (at least on my computer), as it can support upwards of\u00a0<strong>1000 units in combat</strong> with minimal framerate drops</p>\n<p>There are currently <strong>10 levels</strong> in the game, which each introduce new enemy units as they progress, as well as increasing in scale and required strategy. In addition, there is also a\u00a0<strong>custom battle game mode</strong> where you can make your own custom armies to pummel each other until there is nothing but a red streak across the field, and one victorious team.</p>\n\n<p>This project has taken me 8 days to create from start to finish. All sprites and code were made by me.
