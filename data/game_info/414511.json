You have dug two holes in which to throw the crap into, but turds are not the only thing falling from the sky. Hordes of salmon are complicating the situation, and being hit lowers your health. Use the left and right arrow keys to move and the up arrow to jump. Colliding with a turd will cause you to pick it up, and press space to throw it. You get 100 points for successfully landing it in a hole. If your health drops to zero or you fall in a hole, the game is over.\r\n\r\nFor Brackeys Gamejam 2020.1", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3ab813f21c8951642e3691f7ee5d09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pyroburger"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
