So, I've started making a sorta simple RPG for fun. It's completely made up of the built-in assets, or at least, this demo is, but I think I can still make something pretty good.</p>\n<p>This currently-unnamed game is basically gonna be a mashup of a bunch of stuff I like about JRPGs. So far it stars Lettuce, a regular ol' villager with dark powers, and her best friend Zerachielle, a winged catgirl. They decide to go on a trip to beat up a mean wizard, but it may lead to the kind of big adventure Lettuce used to dream about... a journey involving magic crystals, an evil empire, a bunch of twists, and like, probably two other party members.</p>\n<p>This demo covers the intro up to the end of the first dungeon. Let me know if anything's broken, or if there's any awkward writing or whatever.</p>\n<p>Well... some of the writing is awkward on purpose, as a joke. In that case, I guess you should let me know if it's not a good joke.<br/></p><p>UPDATE 0.1 OR SOMETHING: I think a plugin was making it broken oops.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/203b35b757a5d72d45cc5c61320fb025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DonutSecret"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
