You are the only one who can save the world from the god of darkness, named The Night. By defeating him, you can save both Princess Kasumi and the world.. Or at least that's what's supposed to happen.</p>\n<p>Wrath of the Night is an extremely short dungeon-crawler RPG made in GameMaker. It was the first game I finished, alongside a spriter and a secondary game developer. It was finished in Fall of 2013 as part of a class in my freshman year of high school. Improvements will not be made as I haven't used GameMaker in years. The game has a couple different endings, all of which are determined by your actions in the final battle.</p>\n<p>The game will remain free forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d4e07bc7c0a110010b911b533f361f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChiirYuu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
