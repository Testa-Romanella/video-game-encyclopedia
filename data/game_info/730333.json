But you only have the strength to do so while in your nightly monster form, using carrots supplied by the villagers as disposable weapons.<br/><br/>But even in monster form, a local village rabbit is too weak for the never-ending onslaught of raiders. You need to grow stronger! And for that you need to devour the human flesh of your very own villagers.\u00a0Luckily they reproduce at sunrise!<br/><br/>You need to balance the villager population so you can grow stronger, while still maintaining carrot production. How many nights can you last before the village population has succumbed to the raiding forces?</p>\n<p>Made during\u00a0Global Game Jam 2022, on the\u00a0LiU Game Jam\u00a0site, based on the theme\u00a0<em>Duality</em><em>.</em></p>\r\nPlaying instructions\r\n<ul><li>Collect carrots to use for attacks.
