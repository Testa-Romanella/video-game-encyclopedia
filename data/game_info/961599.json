Fight against a friend with On-the-Couch Local Multiplayer or through Steam Remote Play (All multiplayer requires a Bluetooth Gamepad). Jump from platform to platform on a vertical arena to avoid enemy players and the impending void! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaster Jump Charging, Quick Falling, and Double Jumping to maximize your movement. Collect Ammo Boxes and Med Kits to keep the fight going! Activate Power-Ups to annoy your friends or give yourself an advantage! Duel Timers is a unique take on two classic genres!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nImportant Note: Duel Timers requires both a Controller and Keyboard and Mouse. Player 1 will always play on Keyboard, and Player 2 will always play on Controller. This also applies for players using Remote Play Together. Remote Play Together also works across platforms, but a controller is still needed for Player 2, as is the case for all Remote Play Together games with multiple independent players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T03:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d81/d814b70103d8b332614db6a832f1bcee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Isar Uslu"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Isar Uslu"], "esrb_rating": null}
