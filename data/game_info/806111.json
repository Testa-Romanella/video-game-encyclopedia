We think not!</strong></p>\n<p>Welcome to Hell, where rest is not an option. After arriving at your destined afterlife world with your pal - you both have turned into cheeky imps who would do the absolute stupid deed of stealing an eye from the hell gatekeeper himself, just to play Dodgeball with it! Dumb, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, there's more:</strong>\u00a0 that \"friend\" of yours? Well, ain't nobody is a friend of yours in hell!\u00a0Just like the\u00a0good ol'\u00a0saying: \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" - you must act against your pal - or he'll act against you.</p>\n<p>Don't let the Hell gatekeeper catch his own eye in your hands, or else - you will die.
