The players do to not see each other but only <strong>hears\u00a0</strong>the sound the others make. If the noise was made intentionally or not, will be decided by each player perception. A game where everybody is in the dark... the humans trying to escape this living nightmare and the aliens just mind to eat every human aboard. <strong>Now, it is the survival of the fittest.</strong></p>\nGame example (1 TV and 8 mobile)\n<p>This game is a fan-made adaptation developed by me in a period of two months.\u00a0Is intended as a\u00a0<strong>proof-of-concept</strong> for my personal portfolio. So, to clarify,\u00a0<strong>I do not own the original game neither the overall game design I used to make the game I am presenting</strong>. I am only responsible for the few adaptations I made in the tabletop basic game rules and the development of this game itself.</p>\n<p>To see more about the original game, I strongly incentivize you to go to the official website\u00a0and consider buying some version of the tabletop game. I recommend the print-and-play version of the game\u00a0that is smartly crafted and easy to setup to play with a group of friends. All you need is the printed cards and maps, aside pencils and erasers.</p>\n<p>This adaptation is heavly inspired by great party games as Jackbox Party Pack and That's You!, and also by the awesome game cloud platform AirConsole. To play in the simplest way possible, you will need at least a PC and two mobile devices. It is possible to setup the game differently to even play remotely with your friends. Please check the setup instructions that are described below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>If you are interested in the makings of this game, please visit my portfolio page regarding this project. There are described the game design adaptations and this game technological approach. Please feel free to navigate and ask me any question regarding the production of this proof-of-concept.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41ac7ed8af35307417114239ff4408e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Eduardo Pinheiro"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
