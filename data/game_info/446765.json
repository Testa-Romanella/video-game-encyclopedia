The premise is that you wake up in a room with Cell Bot to help you (I'll leave you to figure out the rest).\u00a0The gameplay interface makes use of a Telegram bot customized by me with <em>manybot</em>, cos\u00a0I thought it'd be pretty cool if Cell Bot was an actual bot! :O</p>\n<p>Here's the link to my game:\u00a0<strong>t.me/cell_escapebot</strong> (or you can just search for\u00a0<strong>@cell_escapebot</strong> on Telegram).<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun exploring! &amp; do share the game with your family and friends if you enjoy playing it :)</p>\n<p>---------<br/>Developer's Note:</p>\n<ul><li>The Cell Assets.zip file in the downloads section below just contains the graphical &amp; audio assets I used in the game, not the actual game program. To play the game, use the Telegram link!</li><li>I tried my best to make sure the game runs smoothly but building bots on Telegram is ultimately a new experience for me so please\u00a0pardon bugs (if you happen to find\u00a0any).
