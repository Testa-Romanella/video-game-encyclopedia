{"id": 778013, "slug": "speedcat", "name": "SPEEDCAT", "name_original": "SPEEDCAT", "description": "<p>SPEEDCAT has been my \"pet\" project for the past 2.5 years. It started as an experiment for myself to learn more about how to detect and resolve 2d collisions. When I started, I didn't realize I'd be finishing the\u00a0entire game!</p>\n<p>I've taken my time on this game.\u00a0Whenever I felt like my heart was in it, I'd put some work into the game, and whenever I was feeling burnt out, I took a break! So while it's taken longer to develop than the average development time for a game this size, I feel like this game is the culmination of all I've learned thus far in game development!</p>\r\nHere's a look at the first three levels ever developed for SPEEDCAT! While they have remained largely the same, this was the first real look at what this game was becoming.\r\nPlaying on stream?\r\n<p>Do you want to play SPEEDCAT on stream or in a YouTube video? Go right ahead! Use <em>#SPEEDCAT</em> for your go-live or video announcements on Twitter so we can find your work!
