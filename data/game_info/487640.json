The game's focus is\u00a0 general emotional difficulties that almost everyone has faced, including anxiety, social anxiety and depression. It should be noted that although it could be\u00a0helpful, it's not meant as a treatment for severe mental conditions. If such is the case, the player is advised to see a specialist.</p>\n\n<p>Think Again is unique among therapeutic apps in that it uses evidence based approaches, while striving to be a true video game, with engaging story-driven gameplay in the JRPG style.<br/></p>\n<p>The project is still in development. The demo available here offers a look at the first half hour of the game, which introduces the player to CBT and general gameplay mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4eca019d0d1e38036302f8fc3cfa0207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hmn"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
