This holiday version of the game is a Squidmas gift for Niko Geyer. There's only one level currently, but I might continue to work on it. I recreated several of the sprites faithfully in Pico-8, but made modifications to make them more festive. Press X to jump, use the left and right arrows to control your jump while in the air.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe9994494aaf65498feef6bdcac24e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lokno Decker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
