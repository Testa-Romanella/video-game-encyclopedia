I was inspired to make an autobattler because of the random nature of them, but I wanted the twist to be \"putting your foot on the scales\". Overall I'm happy with what I accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Source code is available at my Github:\u00a0https://github.com/LaffertyDev/gmtk_2022_dice_heroes<br/></p>\n\n<p>Honest reviews of my game are very appreciated!
