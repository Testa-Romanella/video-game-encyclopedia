Yeah, something like that.</p>\n<p>Point is, you fly the plane to the circles and lines while avoiding the clouds, complete the level and move on to the next one. Not much more to it. Later levels include turbo boosting and shooting!</p>\n\n<p>The game features an infuriating innovative control scheme that is seriously rewarding to master.\r\n<br/>\r\nEach joystick controls an engine on each wing, requiring delicate control over both to progress in the game. As a result, <strong>this game requires a controller to be played</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>There are no secrets or collectibles, just you versus the 70+ levels.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a3561d2bfc31b42597c292dfe2d8975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirstu"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
