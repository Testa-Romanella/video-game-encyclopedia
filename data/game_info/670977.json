{"id": 670977, "slug": "kalevala-anttihaavikko", "name": "Kalevala (anttihaavikko)", "name_original": "Kalevala (anttihaavikko)", "description": "<p>The game, as the name might suggest, is heavily based on the Finnish epic poetry <strong>Kalevala</strong> and the mythologies surrounding it. The action takes place in a game board where you throw <strong>dice</strong> to move, attack and eventually delve deeper to the depths of <strong>Tuonela</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game is still very much unfinished and under constant development Albeit a lot slower now that my summer vacation is over. It should be fully playable and relatively bug free though with a hefty <strong>handful of different monsters</strong> to fight, <strong>few unique bosses</strong> and dozens and <strong>dozens of different items</strong> to flesh your character build with. <strong>The five different playable characters</strong> all have some <strong>unique events</strong> dedicated to them only.</p>\n<p>Not much of a tutorial there yet and probably not even that much needed (I guess we'll see now). Just <strong>point and click</strong> the dice and then pick a direction (<strong>WASD</strong> and arrow keys can be used here too to make it easier).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/887/887821f64d1bbcddea43ddda1c1c93d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
