A tesuji (\u624b\u7b4b) is a clever play, the best play in a local position, a skillful move. Tesuji is derived from suji (\u7b4b), which means \"line of play\".<br/>The opposite of tesuji is zokusuji, which can be translated as \"crude line of play\", and also referred to as anti-suji, or a vulgar move depending on the situation.<br/>Tesuji is one of the important aspects of the game in which a player exerts his or her ability to \"read ahead\".
