Not even her dreams are a safe place where she could play.<br/><br/>People disappearing is nothing uncommon in the village, but this time, Lucy is old enough to investigate on her own. Or so she thinks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Explore Silentown in search of hints, but beware: <strong>do not enter the forest.</strong><br/></li><li> A unique, unsettling 2D art style fitting for a mysterious, dark tale.<br/></li><li> Music plays a crucial role, and learning how to sing will help Lucy in times of need.<br/></li><li> Combine items to obtain widely unexpected results! <br/></li><li> Many quirky characters (and animals!) to interact with. Be nice to them before they disappear.<br/></li><li> Play minigames with the other children of the village!<br/></li><li> A very mean cat, programmed to mess with Lucy at any given chance.<br/></li><li> Curious, original puzzles: use a leash and a pair of shears to break in your mother\u2019s best friend\u2019s house, all in order to steal\u2026 a flower?! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T02:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f99694d8852d429bf6dcb925deb19533.jpg", "website": "https://childrenofsilentown.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 205, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Elf Games", "Luna2 Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elf Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
