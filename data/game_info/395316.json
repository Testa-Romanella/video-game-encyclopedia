Each marble can be stuck to an anchor or an existing pixel block to create a new pixel block in a given location, and can also be shaded appropriately. The finished block shape needs to match the solution image to finish the level. The challenge comes in setting up the placement and timing of the marbles' paths to ensure that they land in the solution grid correctly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T05:08:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/5575ef8938a8fb3b14bca9d892763ee6.jpg", "website": "https://www.activeupgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ActiveUP Games", "Active Up Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Active Up Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
