That blue stage has as many stands, as many letters the country name consists of.\u00a0 If a carried letter is correct, it will stay on the stage, otherwise not (if flies to the upper part of the screen, so that you could see which guesses were wrong).</p>\n<p>2 - Repair the damaged floor-wired electricity circuit with the help of your REPAIRMAN,</p>\n<p>who follows you, after you meet (collide) with him.</p>\n<p>It is easy to recognize a damaged wire piece, as there are sparkles on that place, and a horizontal wire can also be clearly seen.</p>\n<p>(Damaged wire-tiles will also have a chance to electrically shock and kill most actors in the game (except for your repairmen and certain kinds of baddies), especially if one is standing on those damaged wire-tiles for long)</p>\n<p>If you are done with all these, the level is cleared, and you can go on till level 10. At every level, you meet new challenges:</p>\n<p>-a new flag and a country name to guess,</p>\n<p>-and a new level layout where you are about to carry the correct letters to the stage, but baddies will try to stop you.</p>\n<p>REPAIRMEN will also give you (in timed intervals) most of the letters necessary to guess the current country name, so close cooperation with them is advisable.</p>\n<p>If that help is insufficient for you to guess the county name, the globe can be summoned (\"Joker\" function) showing where the to-be-guessed country is geographically situated.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0 ASWD / cursor keys</p>\n<p>Shoot:\u00a0 SPACE</p>\n<p>Activate Joker (show the globe): CONTROL\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>Edit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>uploaded a more easy, balanced version, which will help &amp; teach much more, especially in shooter mode.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T07:18:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a96718e80810620a7bae3024db40c1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elodman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
