You can move this grid with WASD, as well as E and Q, to give yourself more space to place nodes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>After you've finished creating your track, you can run it by pressing G. The AI will then go to the first path node it finds. It repeats this process until it finishes the track you've created.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the AI has finished your track, you can press Space to reset and create another track.</p>\n\n<p>Post your best tracks in a discussion thread. I'd love to see them!</p>\n\n<p>Planned features:</p>\n<p>- Save tracks</p>\n<p>- Options menu</p>\n<p>- Tutorial (?)</p>\n\n<p>Feel free donate if you'd like to support a 14 year old aspiring game developer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e16b485707ccab5eba1c50ea6ce25745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PNDA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
