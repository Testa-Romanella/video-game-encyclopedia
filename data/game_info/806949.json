{"id": 806949, "slug": "dick-tracy-sega", "name": "Dick Tracy (Sega)", "name_original": "Dick Tracy (Sega)", "description": "<p>Dick Tracy, released in February 1991 for the Sega Genesis and Master System, was a side-scrolling arcade game where players control the famous hero through various stages to bring down Big Boy. Tracy can walk, jump, duck, shoot a pistol, and use a Tommy gun to hit enemies and objects in the background. Each level had a series of sub-levels to it and bonus points awarded if the players could avoid hitting any of the various objects in the background; i.e., windows, fire hydrants, and street lights. One of the levels switches the action up slightly by having control Tracy during a police chase. Several of the villains from the comic book appear, and the final battle with Big Boy takes place in a scene similar to the climax of the feature film.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-13T08:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/61a/61a6c02a6072f529bf2212e03bb884e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Genesis", "SEGA Master System"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
