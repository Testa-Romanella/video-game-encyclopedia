But every year, there is an event. <br/><br/>This event is a mysterious death. <br/><br/>On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing. <br/>The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project. <br/>A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted. <br/>Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse? <br/><br/>Someone who was supposed to be there isn\u2019t. <br/>Someone who wasn\u2019t supposed to be there is. <br/><br/>Someone who was alive last night is dead now. <br/>And someone who is here right now isn\u2019t alive. <br/><br/>So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up. <br/><strong>But don\u2019t give up. </strong><br/><br/>Only you can stand up to this.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T12:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be80b1bab6d826e58328befb0bb66cd.jpg", "website": "http://www.mangagamer.org/07thExpansion/", "rating": 4.44, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 374, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["07th Expansion"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
