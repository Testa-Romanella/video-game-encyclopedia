Once the chain is greater or equal to the top face, the dice will be removed. </p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>In the interest of honesty, I've been working on the mechanics of this game the last few weeks\u00a0and it happened to fit nicely into the theme of the GMTK Jam. The previously written code was not written intentionally for this Jam, and is simply coincidence that it fits the theme.</p>\n<p>This build is for the Jam and features 15 completely new puzzles build over the Jam weekend, in addition to survival mode and a brand new tutorial.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:27:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69963160754d146ec7ea5aa221e5d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["soyeahimjames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
