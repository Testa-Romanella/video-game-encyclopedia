Do you max out your health to take more hits, or do you grab all the mobility upgrades so you don't get hit in the first place?</p>\n<p>...that was the plan, anyway.\u00a0Unfortunately, I ran out of time, so it's a very barebones experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:23:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/336292780cf1d956da3209d073b757fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["NickHenley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
