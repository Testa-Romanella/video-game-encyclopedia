The characters are actually our programmers, who were shot in Full HD 50fps, not in front of green screen,\u00a0and then\u00a0rotoscoped using AI-assisted keying via RunwayML. To then be downrezzed into\u00a0glorious 320x320 pixels 10fps, and then further reduced in resolution\u00a0by 50% (because they were still too sharp). The game also features stunning 16kBps Mono sounds and an original blast-from-the-past\u00a0soundtrack composed during the jam.</p>\n<p>Team Name:\u00a0Rubber-Duckers</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Jan K\u0159\u00ed\u017e A.K.A.
