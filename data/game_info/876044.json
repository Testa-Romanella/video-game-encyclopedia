It's a topdown shooter where you\u00a0play as a tank that can only move forward and strafe. It was cobbled together in a month as a break from my main project.\u00a0It's definitely not the easiest game and could be improved, but as a game completed in one month I think it's pretty good.</p>\n<p>This project was\u00a0made in the Solarus Engine.</p>\n<p>Note about controls:</p>\n<p>You configure the controls the first time you start the game; if you want to reconfigure simply hit the 'Backspace' key on the title screen, then relaunch the game.</p><p>Graphics (fonts, sprites, etc.), level design, programming and music were all done by me. Sound effects were made in sfxr and FamiTracker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T17:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b71813a29274e0e10aff195692d471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spikira"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
