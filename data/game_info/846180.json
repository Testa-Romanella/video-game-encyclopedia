{"id": 846180, "slug": "sokogun-billy-myers", "name": "Sokogun (Billy Myers)", "name_original": "Sokogun (Billy Myers)", "description": "<p>\"Like Sokoban, but with guns\" - myself (I didn't have anybody else play test this)</p><p><strong>There's currently a bug in the game where you can't restart the game after first completion. Just go ahead and reload the page to restart.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sokogun is a pretty simple concept. You have boxes. Boxes need to be pushed onto those little red X's on the floor. You for some reason can't move, so in lieu of conventional movement, you bring a gun with massive recoil. You do the math.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left mouse button (click) shoots. You'll go the opposite way you shoot (recoil, baby)</li><li>R resets the current level, in case you mess up or one of the boxes flies way out of bounds (it happens)</li><li>Space gives you the supernatural ability to brake (meaning shorter distance traveled when recoiled)</li></ul>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>That's right, baby - a gun in a sokoban-style game. Keep in mind that this gun probably fires blanks so there's no projectile. Instead, <em>you</em> are the projectile!</li><li>A whopping <strong>six</strong> whole levels to go through! (No, I didn't spend way too much time polishing some things in this game, why do you ask?)</li><li>Impressive graphics (my mom would be proud!)</li></ul>\n<p>This is an entry for Trijam #183. As such, this is a game that took three hours to develop. I spent around two hours figuring out how to get Godot to work and about 1 hour doing the rest, so let me know how I did!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\"Pleasant Porridge\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Sounds from freesound.org</p>\n<p>Everything else is by me, Billy :)</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the little content there is here!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T19:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13c003746212e11f82fb9b4c14fc4d04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Billy Myers"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
