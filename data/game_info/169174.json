They are here to take their revenge on those small fast dodgy ships that massacred them!</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0is a\u00a0<em><strong>reverse shmup</strong></em>; instead of controlling one, powerful, small ship that is able to dodge quickly, you have high-level control over a group of ships:\u00a0their overall positioning and general direction in which to fire their weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>Running the game</strong></p>\n<p>Unzip to some folder then run <em>meh.exe</em> from the ReturnToTyrien folder,\u00a0\u00a0or open a command prompt in the same directory as <em>meh.exe </em>and run <em>meh.exe</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>D - Hold the current formation in place</p>\n<p>Hold LMB - point to where to shoot for your ships, AND dodge your ships around. Use it to both focus fire and dodge in a pinch.</p>\n<p>Click RMB - Put down a shield. 1 second cooldown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow keys / Enter / Esc - navigate menus. Enter confirms, Esc back to main menu</p>\n<p><strong>Tactics/Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>You win each level if you can survive without losing too many ships.</p>\n<p>Shaping your formation, maintaining shields, and controlling spawn/fire\u00a0is key to success.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Soundtrack included in assets folder as mp3s!!11111</em></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>all - z0rly\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0z0rly#5623</p>\n<p><strong>Recent changes</strong></p>\n<p>Post-jam update:\u00a0Added enemy warning system, screen shake when your stuff gets blown up.
