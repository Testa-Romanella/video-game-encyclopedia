{"id": 166207, "slug": "rotate-the-room", "name": "Rotate the room", "name_original": "Rotate the room", "description": "<p><em>Created for Ludum dare 37!<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>--CONCEPT-- </strong><br/>This is a puzzle game that it' s all about rotating and moving a room... Move the room, and the ball(Player) will fall due to the gravity. The ball has to collect all the blue-yellow cubes, to complete a level. Avoid the red-yellow cubes(enemies)! They exist 5 levels, and a very difficult test level(tutorial). <br/>...I know, the description doesn't make sense... Try downloading the game, and playing it on high settings, for good \"transparency rendering\"(When you rotate the room too much it will render transparent walls for easier naviga.ti..o... just try it, I can't explain it!) <br/><br/><strong>--NOTES-- </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>This is my first unity game, and my first Ludum dare submission too, so it sucks, expect it. </li><li>If you want to enter free cam mode, press esc and read the description. </li></ul>\n<p><strong>--CREDITS-- </strong><br/>The one asset that I haven't created, is the sound track. That's why I have removed the Audio judging(Ludum dare). Note that I am not a \"graphics designer\", neither a \"programmer\", it if my first try to create a game. The music is the only cool thing about the game, but it is an cc0 asset. <br/> <br/>Have fun! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78b93c83ca64556d6a032f83b0f2a2f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FlameShape"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
