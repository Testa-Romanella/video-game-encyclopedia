Something that would not, preferably, give anyone alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p>Generate bingo cards, get together with friends, watch too much Criminal\u00a0Minds and see who gets bingo first. Exciting! Features over 130 possible entries for lots of variety and printable versions!</p>\n<p>I mostly made this just because I could.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a download-only Twine file because the bingo cards are too large to be properly viewed in the embedded interface.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4fdec5e12b6a6acd861bc79b5c448c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madi ballista"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
