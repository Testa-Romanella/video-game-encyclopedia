Maps are still being made and will be included at no charge to people who have purchased the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse 9 different discs in the current game to play through the courses however you like! Re-attempt throws from the same position if you want to try to get a better position. In future updates we want to include a cash and in-game shop feature so you can buy more discs to adjust your inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith dynamic weather, a sun that moves based on your real time, and lanterns that light up at appropriate hours, we hope that this game is a little immersive, so that you can enjoy the sights to behold in the environment, as beautiful god-rays pierce the clouds and shadows are cast by the trees.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T02:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf6edde2a0d005d495f801a9bb6350ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paul Cooper"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Paul Cooper"], "esrb_rating": null}
