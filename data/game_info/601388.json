Initially I intended this to be a puzzle game, but at the halfway mark I realized that the most I can finish in a couple of hours  is a pleasing-looking sandbox.  I hope you still find it somewhat interesting.<br/><br/>I used Godot as an engine, everything went pretty smooth with it. Exporting the game to multiple platforms was just a few clicks.</p><p>All assets were created by me during development time. It doesn't look like it, but it did take 45 minutes until I found something that is both pleasing and colorblind-friendly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T05:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e6980f9923f8e581b3e57112a3a433b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["dragonfi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
