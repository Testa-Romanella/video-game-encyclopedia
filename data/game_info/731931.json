Vykanic Concepts will be Studio Vykanic's series of small game demos, art, and effects that we create.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This\u00a0game currently reaches its max speed\u00a0as you get past\u00a05 minutes as it is meant as a short concept demo. We will certainly be impressed if you continue to survive for much longer than that!</strong><strong><br/><br/>Note this game was originally built for mobile but we decided to re-build it for web on Itch instead.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click/Tap</strong> - This will shift you to the object you tap.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tap Bottom Right Icon OR Right Click</strong>- This will bring you to the last object you were at.</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\r\n1. Last as long as possible on the field without hitting the red wall.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Objects move from the aqua wall to the red wall. \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. When you tap on an object you will move to it and attach to it \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. You can think of the red gem on an object as the \"eye\" of that object. So you will see what it sees when you shift to it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5. Walls have two sides and you can tap either side.\u00a0 \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6. Columns are one sided and you will attach to the side the large red gem is on. \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>7. The bar on the right indicates how close you are to either wall. \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8. The timer on the top is how long you have survived. \u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>9. In the bottom right is an icon that you can tap (or Right Click)\u00a0to go back to your last position. You can use this mid shift if you want.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. Your best time will save locally\u00a0to your browser indexedDB\u00a0but closing the browser / deleting history (etc) may clear local storage.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>\n<p>For more information on Studio Vykanic or our policies you can go to the blog link below in <strong>More Information</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T13:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9fa81892efe587d83995679c70256cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Studio Vykanic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
