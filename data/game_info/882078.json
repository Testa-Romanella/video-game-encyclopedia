Avoid the enemies there that try to kill you and try to fight your way back to heaven. Be warned, you only have a set number of arrows per section, so be clever with your ammunition! Hell itself wants you dead, so if you're not careful, the air will choke you until your death. The only way you can stop this is by killing all the enemies in a section, which will prevent your death from the fog. The fog accumulates over time, so be wary when your screen starts to mist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: movement</p>\n<p>P: Shoot, hold to delay shooting. During shooting, you can redirect the arrow using the WASD keys one time.</p>\n<p>R: Restart section</p>\n<p>Space: Jump, hold to jump longer</p>\n<p>Note: You can also purify the walls. If you hit the environment with your arrow, it will now let your arrow through. Use this to cleverly take out enemies!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/271/2711fc65e56a491f059f5baf70eab011.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragnwiht3367"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
