The theme \"seven\" was hard for me to work with and it took a couple days before I settled on something.\u00a0 The idea is that you are managing a nature preserve with the last 7 species on the planet.\u00a0\u00a0I currently only have 1.5 species (the .5 is the grass, which is nothing but a tile at the moment). For whatever reason I decided to try 3d for the first time as well as multiple interacting systems.\u00a0\u00a0I never got passed making the \"Nerfullo\" creature AI for movement and reproduction. There is no way to interact with the game at this time.\u00a0 I plan on revisiting this later as a learning project.\u00a0 It was quite fun to try.\u00a0 The other 5 creatures:<br/>Trees, Birds, Rodents, Migrating-eaters, and a narrative surprise for the 7th.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a228c63f824d2f9b0eeb2428d05e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nodeg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
