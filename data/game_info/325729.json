If you're out of the safe zone for too long, you'll fall underwater and drown. The game works with one to four players. In singleplayer, just try to live as long as possible. In multiplayer, try to outlive your opponents! You can quack to push your opponents out of your way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also play as the safe zone in multiplayer; you can't win, but you can have fun trying to kill all the ducks.</p>\n<p>This game was made collaboratively with ComputerCow, Eravin, and I Dislike Names.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming - ComputerCow, I Dislike Names<br/>Design - ComputerCow, I Dislike Names<br/>Art - ComputerCow, I Dislike Names, Eravin<br/>Music - I Dislike Names</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T17:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/1581e24936104640721467c4011e14f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
