Keep your keep alive by keeping your keep alive and destroy the enemy keep which is not alive and make it no longer alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>HTML5 version has low FPS and somewhat choppy audio. Download a desktop version if possible.</p>\n<p>An entry to LD46 \"Keep It Alive\". This is my first full game, so really this is to learn the game-dev stack more than innovating on mechanics. Powered by Godot engine 3.2.1. Made good use of signals and coroutines. Assets are made with Blender (+ SimpleBake plugin), Krita, Audacity, and Musescore. SFX include but are not limited: door slamming, window knocking, paper box crushing, and bad singing.</p>\n<p>Source\u00a0Code:\u00a0https://github.com/rongcuid/ld46-keep-it-alive<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:48:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/646612ec4cbd1bea315fb8742e61f156.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mad Scientist Carl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
