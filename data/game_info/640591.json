These artefacts can help players in battle, missions and even against other players with a main story that can only be found while playing through various worlds\u00a0and interacting with NPC's in various ways or finding a mission which\u00a0leads to the main story.In the NariniVerse you can do almost anything you desire from racing, fighting, business and even waging wars. The NariniVerse is to be an ever evolving world with players being able to travel between the main world and other smaller worlds to find artefacts and seek out adventure and even experience different stories.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a player you will create a virtual character that you will use to find artefacts which can determine how you play, what skills the you gains and how you interact with the game world.</p>\n<p>Currently the game idea is still in concept stage with this dungeon being a test as to what direction to take the game. The combat system will be implemented in the next update and the game will be updated until the multiplayer stage and better customisation.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is being solo developed by myself NariniMugen with hopes of building a team to make the vision of this game come to life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T04:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4e9c814c09604d2217f1728d391d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NariniMugen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
