You don't know how you ended up here. In fact, you don't even know who you are. That's fine. You won't find guidance here, but maybe you can find it in yourself. <br/></p><p>No goals. No pre-defined activities. Just your bike, your thoughts, the void and music. <br/>So relax, listen to some chill beats and enjoy the act of ephemeral creation.</p><p>-------<br/></p>\n<p>Technically still in development, maybe. <br/>I might rework the drifting \"physics\", implement a radio browser and add controller support for the menu. But for the sake of my weekend, let's say it's released. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bc6c04844cc170659021ad6f5b85168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RePurpose/Play"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
