Will they rise to the top, or will they be checkmated before they even begin? Play now and find out in this thrilling visual novel game inspired by the high-intensity world of sports anime.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>PS: So I realized rather belatedly that I was supposed to make the sound and background myself as well. I thought I only had to make the character art, and by the time I discovered otherwise, it was kind of too late to change anything. I really wanted to submit something to this jam, especially considering this is my first ever game jam,\u00a0so I decided to submit what I made anyway. I understand this might disqualify me, but I still really wanted to share what I made and give everyone an opportunity to play\u00a0my game! \r\n</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Lexin_Music\u00a0from\u00a0Pixabay\r\n</p>\n<p>Backgrounds by\u00a0Uncle Mugen\u00a0from\u00a0this page.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T07:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac6/ac627f79d3b422ebcab268f4a31bada1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rsasbeih"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
