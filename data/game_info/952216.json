Each level gets harder than the rest.</p>\n<p>Platforming: You will have to jump from one place to another to reach the top. Some of the obstacles are unique, with different rotations and placements.</p>\n<p>Visuals: I found all objects and textures in the Unity Asset Store, and got my music from Free Sounds! There is also a \"jump\" sound effect, which I made myself. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:48:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57708eee08d3daaf19ec63878f2baf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Denis Zaiko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
