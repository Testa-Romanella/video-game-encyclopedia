What do you think has happened? Think of the first slide, you might find a connection. Did you come up with something? Let\u2019s just tell you. The paintings are stolen and are located in different parallels. And you must find them to complete the game\r\n  </p>\n<p>The next thing you know, you will find yourself in a room of four portals, which are different levels. Each level gets more difficult with time. Our levels are inspired by different paintings. They have either inspired us to make a whole level inspired by one painting or just the feeling we got when we looked at the painting. For example, this painting of Picasso made us feel like we were in a labyrinth, so we created a labyrinth, while the first level was straight up inspired by this painting of Mattis, a forest. \r\n  </p>\n<p>There will be a guard on each level who is going to chase you because they think you are bad, they have misjudged you. Even if they don\u2019t look scary now, trust me they are going to scare you later on the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Parallel Universes is the theme of our game. As you can tell each level is a whole different world, almost felt like a dream as some has told us.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Our game can be hard to play for people with less experience and very easy for players who had played games before and have more experience. By playing \u2018the collector\u2019 you will get mixture of feelings as you meet different guards and as each levels get harder. Emotions like anger, excitement, confusion and jump scares which we all love. \u00a0It is a hard game to play for beginners but an easy game to win for everyone. \r\n  </p>\n<p>People who have played our game say they really enjoy it, and we think you will too.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbb787c5453329449a72d322db0cf416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ungaberattar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
