Pushing the joy stick up moves you forward, down move you back,\u00a0</p>\n<p>left moves you left, and right moves you right. The right joy stick is used for rotation. If you want to look to your left, move the joy stick left,\u00a0</p>\n<p>and if you want to look right, move the joy stick to the right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each coin is worth 1 point. There are many dead ends to the maze so it is your job to figure out the right path, even if it takes a few tries!\u00a0</p><p>Credit for objects used in my game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walls, Floor, Coins, Sounds, and Pillar assets: Maze Generator Package from Unity Asset Store</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/maze-generator-38689 (by styanton)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/78826e6220a036da7447ddeec46a24ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bradley Pawlow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
