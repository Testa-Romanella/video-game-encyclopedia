You must spend your points wisely, and either save up for the big heavy duty skeleton or settle for a more run-of-the-mill skeleton. The skeletons will automatically attack the rock people. There is no way to beat the game since I ran out of time. Have fun with this demo :)</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Bones, Bones, &amp; Bones</em> is about spawning your skeleton army in order to face off against the rock people. All characters in this game are using active ragdolls, which make them move around in weird and unexpected ways. This game is uncomplete, but I'm glad I finished the game to a somewhat playable extent</p>\n\n<p>Linux Version:\u00a0https://dillbin.itch.io/bones-bones-bones-linux-version</p>\n\n<p>*Note - All builds for all platforms will be compiled onto this page once the voting period for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2 is over since no uploads are allowed during that time.
