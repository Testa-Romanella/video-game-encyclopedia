In this realm, a person can ensure their immortality by extracting some of their blood and injecting it into Yggdrasillic soil, soil was taken from the ground of the great tree Yggdrasill. A flower seedling will then begin to grow and upon blooming, the blood donor will emerge reborn. Due to the rarity of this soil, this is a privilege enjoyed only by the nobility and furthers the existing schism between them and the peasantry. The protagonist is Cordelia, a young girl who is determined to take her parent's seeds to the great tree after her family's plot of soil is destroyed by a revolting faction of peasants. To do so she will have to escape her castle home and venture through the peasant's village to the great tree beyond, testing her principles as well as her courage along the way.</p>\r\nThis game was created for the Global Game Jam 2023 with the set theme of roots.\r\nMeet The Team:\r\n<p>Lead Programmer/Lead Designer/Itch.io Page Designer - Thomas Cain</p>\n<p>oD Wreckz - itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Lead\u00a0Artist (2D/3D) - Melis Eser\r\n</p>\n<p>MEL0_SER - itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Lead Gameplay Designer/Programmer -\u00a0Michael Hayes\r\n</p>\n<p>MikeHayes - itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Creative Director/ Global Game Jam Page Designer- Hassan Kazmi<br/></p>\n<p>Kazcreator98 - itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Lead Composer - Rhys Apfelbaum\r\n</p>\n<p>Lead SFX Artist - Iain Henderson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T17:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f3610142680867ae16000f57be958a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oD Wreckz", "GGJ2023 Yggdrasil", "MEL0_SER", "Kazcreator98", "MikeHayes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
