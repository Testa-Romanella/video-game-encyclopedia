THREE VAMPIRES.<br/>MAKE A DEAL WITH DEATH OR DIE TRYING.</strong><br/><br/>What would you do if you had the chance at a second life, after death?<br/><br/>Put your destiny in the hands of three centuries-old vampires in this <strong>LGBTQ+ dark comedy visual novel.</strong> Play as Noe, a normal human, fanfic writer, and lover of all things supernatural with a distinct lack of self-preservation, as they take a chance and enter the strange house on Dead End Drive with the hope that the rumors they\u2019ve heard about its inhabitants are true. There they find Laurel, Ilyas, and Valeria, and they quickly discover that there\u2019s no escape, but not all endings are fatal. <br/><strong>TREAD LIGHTLY</strong>, because there are over 25 ways to die in First Bite, and your journey to immortality won't be a smooth one. If you enjoyed What We Do In The Shadows but wanted it to be just a little bit gayer... this is the game for you. Please note that while the game is rated 18+ there is no full-frontal nudity if that's what you're here for.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>CHARACTERS</strong><br/><br/><strong>Valeria Andrei (She/They) </strong><br/>\u201cAll I\u2019m thinking about is shredding your throat like barbecue, so talk fast.\u201d<br/><br/>She might be the youngest of our trio, but Valeria certainly believes she has the upper hand. But don't let her pretty face fool you, her bite is far worse than her bark. Though... both leave a pretty nasty sting. She's fucked Dracula, likes poetry, cheating at board games, internet shopping, and warm-blooded murder.<br/><br/><strong>Laurel Portman (He/They)</strong><br/>\"Is there something I can do for you? Yes. Is there something I will do for you? Quite unlikely, but it's worth a shot.\"<br/><br/>Laurel is pushing 300 and is a lover of Hot Topic, insincerity, and watching their victims bleed out on the floor while they watch TV. He's also a seasoned connoisseur of the backhanded compliment and a force to be reckoned with. Tread lightly. Or not...<br/><br/><br/><strong>Ilyas Al-Rai (He/Him)</strong><br/>\u201cDesperation makes your blood sweeter, so... beg.\u201d<br/><br/>Ilyas is the oldest but definitely not the wisest of the trio, coming in at a solid 2400 years old. Lover of athleisure, Eurodance, lifting weights, and thinking he's the smartest guy in the room. (Spoiler: he's not.) He's big, he's buff, and he's loveable as hell, but you don't want to be his prey.
