If they have plenty to drink and eat, they might just start a dance party for you.\u00a0\u00a0Add some leaves to the mix and maybe some caterpillar will come to mingle as well! Though if you don't want flies to\u00a0 crash your party, go easy on the food so they don't spoil before they are eaten!\u00a0</p>\n<p>See how long you can get your bugs to dance!</p>\n<p>---Game Tips----</p><p>(Note, if you prefer Large and Loud parties, you may have better performance with a downloadable version, since the HTML5 may not gracefully handle a Proper Bug\u00a0Rave)</p>\n<p>1. To attract some ants or caterpillars,\u00a0\u00a0click on the blueberry or the leaf icon on the clipboard to drop food.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Read your party log on the clipboard to see what each of your bug guest wants or needs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.
