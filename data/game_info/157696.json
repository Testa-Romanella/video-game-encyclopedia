During the first round, white pieces are placed on the first row, and black on the last. White opens the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A player takes their turn by flicking one of his pieces with the index finger to shoot it at one or more of the opponent's pieces. If the move pushes one or more of the opponent's pieces off the board while all of the shooting player's own pieces remain, the player gets an extra move.</p>\n<p>When a move fails to dislodge an opponent's piece, or the player dislodges one of the player's own pieces, the opponent's turn to move begins. The game continues until only one colour remains on the board, winning the round. Then the winner starts the next round, with that player's pieces one row further forward. When the seventh round starts, the black and white rows will be next to each other.</p>\n<p>If a piece is flipped upside-down after an impact, it is called a\u00a0<em>traitor</em>\u00a0and the opponent gets control of it.</p>\n<p>For the seventh and subsequent rounds, not only does a successful shooter move forward one row, but the loser is forced to move backwards. When one of the players reaches the final row, the opponent has no place left for their pieces and therefore loses the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/54646cb574d008dff7ca8a01a96a1635.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SilentGamzee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
