Ghosts and specters haunt the corridors, combining and growing in the saturation of the supernatural.  </p>\n<p>Yet it is within this place that Daughter confronts her nightmares to seek her Mother, her life's only warmth and comfort.  But at what cost?</p>\n<p>This is the updated August 2018 Demo. \u00a0Chairs do not break instantly, movement and collisions are more refined, and other various changes. \u00a0I make this game all by myself, so progress is very slow.\u00a0 Sorries.<br/></p>\n<p>If you make a play through video, or series, I'd love to check it out!\u00a0 With this sort of game, reactions are pretty great to see.<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback and suggestions welcome in the board below.\u00a0\u00a0 Check in the message boards below for updates regarding 1.0.\u00a0 Or, even better, join the Discord server!\u00a0 Links and contact info are in the discussion board below.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de2fb3a4df5c2896d0bdbbac7259868.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miracle Blade Chan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
