Small rocks may release crystal power-ups that when collected, upgrade shields and guns. Shooting these crystals will degrade your ship accordingly. This has the effect of usually doing short blasts in specific directions and herding enemies into positions that diminish that collateral damage. </p>\n<ul><li>12 levels and an end game.</li><li>4 epic boss battles.</li><li>Fantastic sound track.</li><li>Online high score tables.</li><li>Pilot training sessions.</li><li>3 ships with different controls.</li><li>Windows, Mac and Linux.</li><li>DirectX and OpenGL drivers on Windows.</li><li>Light machine specs.</li><li>Nice small 5meg download!</li></ul>\n<p>Notes: The Linux version has only been tested on Ubuntu and that's the major distro I currently support.
