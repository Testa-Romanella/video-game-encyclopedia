A mysterious murder happened yesterday at Mountain City School. Sources tell us that a grand piano was dropped from the stage and fell upon two students, they were reported dead later in the night.\"<br/></em>\n<em>Mountain City, 1998. Christmas Eve. In the same school a group of friends breaks in trying to document ghosts on tape.<br/></em>\n<p>A short visual novel made in 3 days for Bitsy Jam #66 (https://itch.io/jam/bitsy-66-ghosts-on-holiday).</p>\n<p>I was inspired by old horror movies that I've watched during this year's Halloween. I wanted to make a lofi, minimalistic vn with some of the tropes of that genre (flashback intro, school at night, holiday season, group of kids looking for danger and so on...). There's a specific mood to those movies that really makes them comfy to me, I hope I've managed to recreate at least a bit of that atmosphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think this idea can be developed more in the future, adding more features and refining/expanding the story.<br/></p>\n<p>English might be a bit weird because it's not my native language and I didn't have time to involve another person to proof-read, sorry for that! <br/></p>\n<p>For the graphics I've used images generated by Stable Diffusion AI, ported to Bitsy thanks to the great Pixsy hack https://ruin.itch.io/pixsy. Music was added with Bitsy Muse https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/main/dist/bitsymuse.js</p>\n<p>Music was also inspired by old horror movies, especially the chaotic spooky music from Silent Night Deadly Night (1984) which perfectly fits with the holiday setting.<br/></p>\n<p>Music (made by me) will be available in the future on my bandcamp: https://wanderingartist.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T16:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b0/2b005ad24ad24382f214e9133fd49750.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wandering Artist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
