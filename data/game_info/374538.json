Maybe too simple.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nQuickly dive into a game of hockey with 2 skaters and a goalie on each side. You'll have to pass, shoot, and hit your way to victory even it that means taking out the ref. Plug in more controllers and have a Blockey party with your friends as you can work together or take each other on. And if you're ever lost in life you can even try our \"Ask the Bear\" mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was originally made in 2010 for the Xbox 360 indie marketplace. It was my first ever project which put me down the path of software development.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T02:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090e0cbb581b5390a2b4bce37fde84cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Walking Talking Grilling Bear"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Walking Talking Grilling Bear"], "esrb_rating": null}
