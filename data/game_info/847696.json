Only 'problem' I'm aware of (Unless this is just how it's supposed to work) is that Browsers will keep save files despite any game file changes from my end, which I'm not used to. I'm used to the save file disappearing.<br/>There are save flags in the black screen portal scenes and Meanwhile scene. They should work fine.<br/><br/>These characters and events here do not affect the canons of their original games/other games they are in outside of this Mashup Set/Series.</p>\n<p>Controls -</p>\n<p>Movement - WASD/ Arrow keys</p>\n<p>A = Enter</p>\n<p>B = Shift</p>\n<p>Start = c (Start on Title Screen, nothing mapped to it in-game)</p>\n<p>Select = v (Nothing this time.)<br/></p>\n<p>--------------------</p>\n<p>Basically -</p>\n<p>Again, just like last time - This is a mashup of various backgrounds and characters (Most original, some direct from RPGTsukuru or Animorphs) that I (for original stuff) have made/altered over the two years I've been learning to make games. At least two time periods from medieval to present/futuristic, so maybe 3.</p>\n<p>The storyline came from collecting a bunch of event points and throwing them into a randomiser then improvising a coherent story out of them, and winging the dialogue as I made the game according to the plot events.</p>\n<p>I thank my friend Kingslayer for wanting a multiverse for inspiring this XD</p>\n<p>I also thank one of my best friends Krypt for helping me make some fresh backgrounds I was using for another game as is, <br/>And <br/>My mod for letting me use his character.<br/></p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>Look at the first game for basically the same explanation XD</p>\n<p>I came up with most of the ideas this time around, still looking at various books/DVDs/games around me) and dumped them into a randomiser. I did the same with ideas I got from other peeps.</p>\n<p>I've also again 'cheated' in the ways of updating my pre-existing backgrounds to ones that better fit the tile (8x8-pixel) limits and making connecting rooms to pre-exists, and using basic characters from RPG Tsukuru/Animorphs.</p>\n<p>This game was originally inspired by my friend Kingslayer saying I needed to do something with a multiverse so HERE YA GO!
