Hope you're ready.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTERRAIN DESTROYING WEAPONS<br/>\r\nConquering all five stages of this virtual world will test your proficiency with powerful weapons such as the Zero Day Rocket Launcher and Laser. This world doesn't just take the hit either. These firearms will blow holes right through the terrain. There's even a weapon that will place floating platform in your path to get you out of tricky situations.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPARKOUR<br/>\r\nIf those toys won't get you to the exit, your parkour abilities definitely will. Your extensive parkour skills will let you scale buildings and escape danger with ease. Climb walls. Dash through the air. Even chain them together and try to never touch the groumnd. The floor may literally be lava in some cases. If climbing won't get you there, you can choose to charge right through your problems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDIVERSE STAGES<br/>\r\nWe're preparing you for anything. That might be scaling skyscrapers, surviving a meteor shower, traveling through an asteroid base, or discovering a mysterious island that only shows itself when you approach it. You might even find yourself in the center of a volcano fighting some high tech weaponry! Be ready to adapt to your surroundings, agent.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a58eb93365887113b419eefb214b680c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voxel Party"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["DigiPen Institute of Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
