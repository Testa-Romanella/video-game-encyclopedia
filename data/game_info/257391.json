It was a very personal project that deals with my struggles navigating the pitfalls of the art world and my realizations and epiphanies regarding the complex systems within that world. It is a love letter as well as a Dear John letter.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/253c703f45892120adcdc9af56ca6c20.jpg", "website": "http://www.hunterjonakin.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hunter Jonakin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pomp Life Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
