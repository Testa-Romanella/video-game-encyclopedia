I believe\u2014 [GUNFIRE, HOLLERS]\u2014yep, looks like the arm is staying on just fine. <br/>[END TRANSMISSION]\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>ANESTHETIC DEPTH</strong>\u00a0is a rules add-on pamphlet for\u00a0FIST,\u00a0inspired by\u00a0<em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>\u00a0and Cavegirl's\u00a0<em>Horrible Wounds,</em>\u00a0which adds an injury and treatment system to replace the simpler, default\u00a0HP method. Characters must keep track of injuries incurred by different amounts of DAMAGE, which can stack and reduce their MAX HP (among other nasty effects) without proper treatment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>FIST operatives may find themselves unable to move without getting hurt, forced to sit out for several missions while an alternate character takes over, or choosing a bombastic final act before poison overtakes their body. When this add-on is active, the referee treats all injuries as part of the fiction. Injured characters may have to roll for simple actions which other characters would not, such as carrying gear or staying quiet.</p>\n<p>Areas of treatment include:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>DAMAGE TYPES</strong>\u00a0- Attacks are now classified by six damage types\u00a0(BALLISTIC, CUTTING, IMPACT, BURNING, TOXIC, and PSIONIC), all of which result in varying ailments and injuries based upon the amount of damage dealt. Break legs, get third-degree burns, and watch your own mind unravel from stress. Mechanically, you may find yourself with less than your usual health pool or suffering from attribute de-buffs without first aid.</li><li><strong>MEDICAL SCAVENGING</strong>\u00a0- Injuries are healed by medical supplies, a new resource which you'll have to keep track of during missions and frequently replenish by searching cupboards, bathrooms, and lockers with the Medical Supplies table. Characters who would be reasonably better at scrounging up necessary materials get a TACTICAL bonus.</li><li><strong>ALTERNATIVE HP</strong>\u00a0- Instead of dying at 0 HP, characters begin accruing permanent injuries when they drop into the negatives. Your FIST operatives will survive for much longer, but maintaining access to the proper care and tools will be a little more complicated.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T06:54:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bda/bdafa2f76cf406b9057caad982f2de35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["claymore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
