{"id": 528672, "slug": "shutterbug-stud", "name": "Shutterbug Stud", "name_original": "Shutterbug Stud", "description": "Shutterbug Stud is a fun, character driven, scavenger hunt, where the player is commissioned to take pictures of local girls for a calendar. As such, the player must roam the town and countryside looking for willing girls to photograph, and fulfilling tasks for ~almost~ willing girls. For every (quality) picture you deliver you are paid, and are one step closer to the goal of a finished calendar and, hopefully, a fat wallet.<br/>An RPG Maker game, enjoy exploring the town, seeing the sights (and the girls) and maybe finding some hidden secrets to discover. <br/>The core game is filled with characters and pictures that range from cute to a little suggestive. A planned expansion has pictures ranging from suggestive to very suggestive, but still fairly tame. Further expansions (or third party art) may push these limits even further.<h3>FEATURING:</h3><ul><li>\u2022\t12 Major Characters<br/></li><li>\u2022\t24 Reward Pictures<br/></li><li>\u2022\tScenic Morlock Lake (Town and Environs) to Explore<br/></li><li>\u2022\tStandard RPG Maker Controller Support<br/></li><li>\u2022\tArt package free (found in core game files)<br/></li><li>\u2022\tDLC Coming Soon!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T02:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c05ac019b0551426e300ab00318a73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astutio Gaming"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Astutio"], "esrb_rating": null}
