Yes, we are telling you how to say it so you can be one of the cool kids, now let us get back to what we were saying. Not totally sure? Practice saying it with us in the land of Discord. Plus you'll get access to the schedule as it becomes available for various bits. Onward!<br/><br/>IWOCon 2020 is a digital convention app with a stylized pirate theme. Huh? Ok ok, not everything is technically stylized nor pirate since at the heart of the convention are indie games and their displays can be quite the contrary to \"stylized.\" But the characters are, so enjoy those stylized curves.<br/><br/><h3>\"Cosplay\"</h3><br/>However, stylized or not, you'll get to feel like a pirate! Fine fine, maybe a bit more like a stylish human on a pirate themed vacation wearing some throwaway outfits of real pirates as your cosplay costume so you can blend in just a little bit better in the app (NOT a \"game game\" let us clear that right up). Take a breath now, that was a long sentence.<br/><br/><h3>IWOCon Islands</h3><br/>The IWOCon Islands are filled with stylized beauty and the booths of indies. Take flight! Welllll maybe...set sail? And enjoy the journey of discovery as you find a bunch of rocking new and upcoming indies to dig into under the rays of the digital sun, shiver me timbers! <br/><br/><ul><li>Don't say that to the real pirates. They'll know you are a \"land-lover.\"</li></ul><br/>You'll get that feeling of fantasy mixed with reality, a benefit that can only be had in digital. It is like a real convention, only not really, ok maybe not much at all. Maybe a little? We do have game pages online though, and pretties to look at, but we have removed all the sweaty bodies and generic plastic chairs. <br/><br/><h3>Pull the Trigger</h3><br/>Hang on, that is a good thought-- maybe we will throw in a few generic plastic chairs for good measure. BD That there looks like a \"B\" and a \"D\" but is actually an old-school \"emoji;\" it used to be how you made a smile with sunglasses. We cool.<br/><br/><ul><li>You can be cool too. Just wishlist now for all that loot.</li></ul><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422300/IWOCon_2020/<br/><br/>Can you travel through all the booths and fill your passport of indies? We dare you. No, actually we double-dog-dare you. BD<br/><br/>We know you know what that means this time. ;)<br/><br/>Now go, walk the plank, that is a direct order from us. Don't do it in real life though, we mean in this app. Eventually.
