The project takes on a \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d, pre-school game aesthetic to explore the serious issue of social justice and police brutality and to ultimately inspire thought and commentary on the subject. Solutions to this problem have been explored by social movements such as Black Lives Matter. This game attempts to bring perspective to the issue of police brutality by pointing out the paradox of ordinary, harmless objects becoming the catalyst for their owner\u2019s devastating demise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/162fde2b38e727137ca92025f399c28f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Streaty1"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
