{"id": 276949, "slug": "planetdetonator", "name": "PlanetDetonator", "name_original": "PlanetDetonator", "description": "Planet Detonator is a free space game where you touch the asteroids and missiles before they touch the planet. There are 50 levels, and with each level the game gets a little more difficult as the asteroids and missiles go faster, get smaller, and fade in and out on their way to the planet.<br/><br/>At the highest levels, the play is so fast, that is nearly impossible to win. So we added some help for you. The first bit of help comes in the form of detonators. You get up to 10 of these detonators, and they are fairly easy to get. You get one detonator with each 30 points. One point is equal to one touch.<br/><br/>Another feature slows the asteroids, and another increases the size of the asteroids. For every 1500 points you earn, you get 10 minutes with these two features. You can also purchase these features for a day or a week in the app. There is still no guarantee of winning as the missiles can still come at you very quickly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff2a344056fdaa95aa1c9e27dfef65b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Little Family Games"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Little Family Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
