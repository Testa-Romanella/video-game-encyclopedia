There are some bugs, but the game is playable. It was made in 3 days.. (Yes i waited too long to start it and had to do a crunch for 3 days.. no sleep). It would be awesome if you could donate as well, im a student so every little helps :)! But don't worry if you can't, it's only a short game so not even worthy of a donation xD.</p>\n<p>Anyways i would love to hear feed back on it, more from a design perspective as i am aware that there will be bugs :)</p>\n<p>Also i did not make most of the assets, however i did make a few (or edited them).</p>\n<p>I have also attached the actual project file so if you feel like it you can play around with stuff :) enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Psssst! I called the game little quest to have an exuse for the game being short :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a5965fc9258da2ad21b763e2f5470ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlayPure"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
