Until he's called down to the Rift Zone to investigate another case of murder gone deadly. A case that Murphy won't soon forget.</em></p><p><em>I mean there's no reason he would... It's not like he's been asked to memorize a really long number or something. I can remember loads of dumb stuff from like 20 years ago, and none of it was anywhere near this exciting!</em></p><p>\r\n\tPlay as post-millennial investigator Jon Murphy, as you point and click your way through a soft-boiled cyberpunk detective story. Featuring over 20 minutes of recorded dialogue - a LOT for a game that's only 10 minutes long. What can I say, dumb cyberpunk jokes are fun to write!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>CREDITS</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Game by Dave Lloyd @duzzondrums</li>\n<li>Voices by Adrian Vaughan @yeoldshrimpeyes</li>\n<li>Music By Louis Meyer @louisdmeyer and Ben Weatherall @sunraheadgear</li><li>The real Jon Murphy @nuclearfriend</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>MORE FREE GAMES BY US </strong></p><ul><li>powerhoof.com</li><li>seadads.itch.io</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c28cd9825a8e080ec3f4d6f4b2f59b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Powerhoof"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
