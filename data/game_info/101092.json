Improve your stats and play for a better highscore!<br/><br/>This is a project I have been working on for sometime now and intend to continue developing abit (depending of how much I like what it's becoming).</p><p>Right now I need feedback from you guys, so please write in comments what you did/didn't like about it, or if you should have any ideas of what I could add to improve!</p><p>I am not sure if I have made everything clear enough with controls and such so I will put some temporary tips: <br/>* To create a unique sheep u have to aim at a normal sheep and then press 1-3 (will be more sheep avaible later) and then have enough fatigue to create it (might change this, will see).<br/>* Firing a projectile at a unique sheep will make it follow you, and then fire again to make it unfollow.<br/><br/>If you should find a bug, feel free to write in comments and I will try my best fixing it. I am also aware that some screen resolutions might (not sure) screw up UI, so if you should notice UI not fitting the screen I would be very greatful knowing your screen resolution!<br/></p><p>There are ony two maps at the moment and one of them is just my test map, but I will hopefully add more in the future!</p><p>All models and textures are made by me, except for terrain and grass textures which are from http://www.cgtextures.com/.</p><p>Skyboxes are from: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/18353.<br/>Audio is from: https://freesound.org/.<br/><br/>The game was made in Unity3D.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/345cf88f2726cd11a9f379bd9b6fe65c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fetdressing"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
