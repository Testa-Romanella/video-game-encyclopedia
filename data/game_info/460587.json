This is a parody of dating shows. You get to nickname the contestants, go out on dates with them, and eliminate them.<br/></p>\n<p>This game contains M/M and M/F sexual content. The protagonist is a male human. There are 10 female NPCs and 10 male NPCs. There are eliminations in the game, so if you don't like one gender, then you can get rid of all those characters of that gender at the first elimination ceremony. \u00a0The super sexual content appears later in the game, so it's easy to avoid unwanted content.</p>\n<p>Male NPCs: Anole; Elephant; Fox; Horse; Otter; Roadrunner; Shark; Spider; Stoat; Tiger</p>\n<p>Female NPCs: Bear; Caiman; Lynx; Okapi; Scorpion; Shoebill Stork; Squirrel; Tapir; Tuatara; Wolf<br/></p>\n<p>Right now the game is a little small with only a few elimination ceremonies, a few dates, and a few sex scenes. I'll expand the content in future updates.<br/></p>\n<p>This is Version 1.00 of Anthro Love. You can find more games on my Patreon, discord, and FurAffinity accounts with the specific links listed on the first page of the actual game.
