Players fighting each other are all using the same\u00a0basic kit. Every punch/attack will knockback your enemy instead of doing your traditional \u201cdamage\u201d. The more \u201cdamage\u201d the players have taken from enemies attacks the more drastic the knockback becomes, progressively stacking until the player dies. The player\u2019s goal is to knock the other players into the hazards on the map, the hazards will kill the player in one hit. Players will have 3 lives in a round whoever is the last one standing will win the round/stage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/1397416d3f87fe32123a8bb731bccb72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
