What about drink lean? Well now you can do both! In Among Us Lean Simulator you run through the corridor of an amogus ship and collect the lean that was left behind by the imposter!<br/><br/>Notes: Lean spawns in at a random interval between 1-20 seconds, so if it feels like you aren't having any lean spawn you're just unlucky. The top wall is supposed to be a wall, but my colliders are bugged or something and it just doesn't work. <br/><br/>This game isn't mean to be serious, expect bugs, and other issues. It was simply to help me learn Unity. <br/><br/>Enjoy Among Us Lean Simulator!<br/><br/>Background Music:</p>\n<p>Among Us Drip Theme Song<br/>By: Leonz</p><p>Link: </p><p>(Plz don't sue me)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T08:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4b39b2206d405aba644522c0f749c96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PresidentPie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
