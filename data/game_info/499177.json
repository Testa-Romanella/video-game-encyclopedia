You decide to strike a deal with the Devil that if you finish your grandfather's unfinished work, his sentence will be reduced. Collect statues, gems, and sacrifice pesky skeletones to the altar of time in order to please the Devil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game currently only has an infinite survival mode, where the goal is to reach the highest possible score. Future plans include for a more story-based gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>Made by 2 Canadian high school students (Tyson Black and Reese Mayea) for VimJam! Since we're still going to school, we didn't get as much done as we wanted, but we both like to think it is as good as we could get it with our available time! It's also our first Game Jam!</p>\n<p>All programming, music, and some sound effects by Tyson Black</p>\n<p>All Artwork, Voice Lines for The Devil (Easter Eggs), and other sounds effects by Reese Mayea</p>\n<p>The game relates to the collectables focus in multiple ways, but we plan to expand the game in the future to allow for \"time\" to be the collectable of focus. As for the theme, it is quite the game of back and forth between finding items in the labyrinth and bringing them back to the altar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:33:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c01/c01f3e1bab4903bb9a451fe82d2518f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamPaktGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
