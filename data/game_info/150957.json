Find a green triangle to head to the next floor.<br/>\u00a0- You can't deal any form of damage, so take note of the log and which color attacks/are afraid of which color so you can lure different colors\u00a0together to clear paths.<br/>\u00a0- The webGL build occasionally seem to lag spike. I think it occurs when there are too many colors densely packed in one location.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ead/ead78cc81e90c5fb08f0ca2ed0a6dc01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rubyleehs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
