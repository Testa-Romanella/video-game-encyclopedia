The recorder or you messed up, and all the tape from the cassette is coming out of it. But worry not, you know what to do!<br/>Simply find a pen, stick it through the cassette and rewind it until all the tape is back on the cartridge again. Now it can start playing, and both you and the cartridge are happy :).</p>\n<p>A nostalgic game about a small cartridge that has lost all his tape.</p>\n<p>In each level, your task is to rewind the tape by collecting all the pens.<br/>BUT BE AWARE! Scissors want to cut your tape to never let it play again O.O.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game and if you are interested in how the game was made, simply go to my youtube channel, you can find a short log for every day of the jam</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing,<br/>Fabian.</p>\n<p>-Made for Brackeys Jam-<br/></p>\n<p>Credit goes to:</p>\n<p>Background: https://cc0textures.com/</p>\n<p>Music:<br/>https://soundimage.org/<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects:<br/>https://freesound.org/people/SophieMezaM/sounds/446096/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/passAirmangrace/sounds/340872/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/meroleroman7/sounds/238282/<br/>Freesound - \"Fast Forward\" by plasterbrain<br/>Freesound - \"Button 01.wav\" by JarredGibb</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d18369b7436e552f2ceabf3495e2c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["motuDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
