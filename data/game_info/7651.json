But the shogun has an ace up his sleeve: you! As the head of a leading ninja clan, it's up to you to rally your followers and help unify Japan!<br/><br/>As their fearless leader, you'll need to train your fellow ninjas in the ways of modern 16th-century warfare--including the use of those newfangled matchlock guns! Assign them to infantry, cavalry, and other units to form an army fit for a shogun!<br/><br/>Of course, war is costly in more ways than one. Between battles, your followers will raise funds by producing food, handicrafts, and other goods to sell to passing travellers.<br/><br/>Arm your ninjas with the best gear, training, and skills and lead them to victory in the struggle for unification! You may even meet some of the era's greatest generals along the way...<br/><br/>\u25bcGame Flow<br/>Earn money by having your villagers make goods to sell to visiting travellers. Defeat warlords or use items to acquire new territory and expand your village.<br/><br/>\u25bcUnify Japan<br/>As the game advances, your villagers will be able to join the shogun's forces in battle. Send them to fight regional warlords and help unify Japan under the shogunate.<br/><br/>\u25bcIncreasing Villagers<br/>Local lords join your village if you defeat them in battle. Defeating warlords can reveal other potential villagers who will join you if the price is right.<br/><br/>\u25bcTraining Villagers<br/>You can spend money to strengthen your villagers through training, raising their levels and making battles easier to win. Some may also learn new skills.<br/><br/>\u25bcTravellers<br/>You can earn money by selling travellers food from your fields or goods from your shops.
