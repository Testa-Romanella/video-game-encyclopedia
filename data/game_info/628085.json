I do recommend playing with headphones though.<br/></p>\n<p>Otome Jam 2021 logo seen in the trailer video is by\u00a0Foleso. </p>\n<p>I might make an alternate sorta genderbended version of this sometime soon where the protagonist is male and features female versions of Aku and Doyle.</p>\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Writer/Creator/OST -\u00a0Melancholy Marionette\r\n<br/>UI &amp; Sprite Artist -\u00a0maneki-mushi\r\n<br/>CG Artists -\u00a0sophrossynes\u00a0&amp;\u00a0LazyCrocodile\r\n<br/>Additional Character Concepts -\u00a0Desichan\r\n<br/>Beta Reader -\u00a0Lilal\r\n</p>\r\nThe Cast\r\n<p>Leah -\u00a0Rae Gibson\r\n<br/>Akuji -\u00a0rongvoice\u00a0-\u00a0@rongvoice\r\n<br/>Doyle -\u00a0Lars van den Haspel/LarsVoices\r\n<br/>Fleur -\u00a0Megan \"The Fangirl\" Gotham\u00a0-\u00a0@The_Fanily\r\n<br/>Male Doctor -\u00a0rodas1e\r\n<br/>Female Doctor -\u00a0CloudyDecember\r\n<br/>Steve - Timothy Smith\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThank you so much to everyone who helped me bring this project to life!
