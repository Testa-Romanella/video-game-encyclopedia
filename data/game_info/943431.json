This increases your income.</p>\n<p>Some additional information:<br/>&lt;-&gt; you can exit the game by pressing the Q key.<br/>&lt;-&gt; The minimum time required for the grass to spawn is 0.1 seconds, and the maximum time is 30 seconds. With upgrades you can reduce the maximum time for grass to spawn to 1 second.<br/>&lt;-&gt; You can have up to 9 workers.<br/>&lt;-&gt; Workers can move up to 100 pixels at a time. Initially 1, it is increased to 100 with upgrades.<br/>&lt;-&gt; Grass does not spawn on the points where the workers stand.<br/>&lt;-&gt; The game has no purpose after all upgrades have been purchased.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:18:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff6ea3472d50cb51c2fbd31193df60f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Void"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
