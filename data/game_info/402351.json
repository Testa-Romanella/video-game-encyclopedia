Soaring temperatures have made the surface almost uninhabitable and what remains of humanity is desperately trying to survive. You were out searching for supplies when a heat storm started to roll in. You made it into an old bunker just in time but the passage collapsed behind you. Will you hold out long enough for someone to rescue you? Can anyone hear your radio calls for help? Is anyone even still out there?</p>\n<p><strong>Calling out into the night</strong>\u00a0is the eleventh chapter in my\u00a0<strong>One day at a time</strong>\u00a0series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order.\u00a0<strong>Calling out into the night</strong>\u00a0is based on the 2018 Global Game Jam theme of \"Transmission\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f151674ef262e1b9c2a8b0d2690baf70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
