Clicker game that you role play as a movie director/tycoon trying to release movies! Main PC is called Adem/Chadem/Brokem. You click to get Production (V) and click to get Money ($), you also passively earn both. You spend (V) on making movies and if you do so successfully you earn ($). You can spend ($) to buy upgrades. The goal is to successfully release movies by either meeting the requirements of (V) or taking a Gamble!</p>\n<p>Taking a Gamble Explained:</p>\n<p>The unique mechanic of this game is that you can take a chance to try and release a successful movie without meeting the requirements. For example if you have 10 production and you need 20 production to release a movie you have a 50% chance of successfully releasing the movie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Current Production\u00a0 / Total number of Production needed = Ratio x 100 = (The percentage\u00a0of chance)\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you fail it means the movie you released was unsuccessful and it forever haunts your record! If at the end of your career you have more unsuccessful movies that successful you lose!</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<p>-Cameras:\u00a0 Provide extra 0.5 V when Production button clicked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Lighting:\u00a0 Provides extra 0.5V whenever the timed \"tick\" comes in.</p>\n<p>-Crews: Lowers timer by 0.5 seconds (At the start of the game the timer is at 2.5 seconds that at the end of it adds to both resources or when the \"tick\" comes in).</p>\n<p>-Specialist: Provide extra 0.5 V when production button clicked and lowers timer by 0.5 seconds.</p>\n<p>-Indie Director: Provides extra 1.5 V\u00a0whenever the timed \"tick\" comes in.</p>\n<p>-Famed Director:\u00a0 Decreases the chance of failure by 5%, \u00a0Provides extra 1.5$ whenever the timed \"tick\" comes in and\u00a0Provide extra 0.5 $ when Money button clicked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Creative Liberty:\u00a0Lowers timer\u00a0by 1 second,\u00a0 \u00a0Provide extra 1 V when Production button clicked and\u00a0Provides extra 1 V whenever the timed \"tick\" comes in.</p>\n<p>All Upgrades Stack.<br/></p>\n<p>Some notes:<br/></p>\n<p>-Wanted to add more Upgrades but due to not enough time did not.
