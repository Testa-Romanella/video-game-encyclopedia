Millennia ago you suffered an unforgivable transgression, one perpetrated  by the humans. They have forever wounded you, they put you on the back foot with this most dishonorable of feats and thus you were brought to heel and so you retreated to the dragon realm with your kin in tow. <br/></p>\n<p>They did the unthinkable... They chopped of your legs! <br/></p>\n<p>What is a king with no legs. For a millennia you have been prevented from enjoying your eternally loved walks on the beach, you have been withheld from the joy of sand slipping between your toes. But now you are back, with a level of wrath only the king of dragons can muster, you have returned and vengeance will be yours.   <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Made By DrachenGruppe</p>\n<p>Dion Bird</p>\n<p>Reece Jones</p>\n<p>Finlay Petersen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e52/e52e7e7469884c2ce38ffcd3b6f9961c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DrachenGruppe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
