The initial plan was to give the player the challenge of organizing their inventory by changing the orientation of items to fit into a grid more\u00a0efficiently (a bit like Tetris). But unfortunately, this was a one-man project for a 2-day game jam and I did not get around to creating this fundamental feature. This current version of the project is however a good demonstration of the other areas of the game. AKA the ship is pretty fun just to fly around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by Tim Metcalf\u00a0Games\u00a0Design at the University of Gloucestershire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:36:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/126cf0a7d6e2541fbb769a74c0ddb90c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timofspades"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
