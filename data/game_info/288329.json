These reorient the player's perspective and control scheme and allow for clever use of the level geometry to reach new sections that would be otherwise inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Currently, the game is a prototype with a single level, that showcases the main mechanic and some of its possible applications, such as parallel wall hopping or \"lateral\" drops, only accessible from a certain perspective.</p>\n<p>It can be controlled with the keyboard, with the W, A, S, D keys and the spacebar, but these can be remapped from the launcher.</p>\n<p>In its current form, the game lacks audio input and has a rudimentary visual presentation, but it requires good coordination for some of the trickier sections as the camera behaves unconventionally. Due to its limited form, it has no accessibility features, however, it is not very taxing input or information-wise.</p>\n<p>\"Taking a Stroll\" is short, only showcasing its mechanics in a limited format and can be beaten in a couple of minutes. For the purpose of playing, I recommend the default input as most of the testing was done utilising it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9cb4cbc0ad87bbc394e9f1d6d5e94a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAnarchyDice"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
