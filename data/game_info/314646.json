The player will need to work their way around a dark environment, using only the small light given off by the player character to guide their way. Throughout their journey, they\u00a0will accumulate small creatures called\u00a0Meeps that will add to the amount of light that the player character will emit. The player will encounter puzzles that will require them to sacrifice the small creatures to larger creatures in order to get through. The player\u2019s goal will be to reach the top of the cave that they are in, escaping into the light.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Completed as part of a Bachelor of Games Development (Design)</p>\n<p>!
