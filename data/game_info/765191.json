After completing all 4, you have the option to restart in endless mode. You reach the next stage after the snake (known as \"Snek\") consumes 50 food (known as \"Snak\"). If Snek collides with the wall or their body, they revert to the beginning of the current stage.\r\n</p>\n<p>There's some hidden quality of life improvements too, like queueing button presses if you press too quickly, preventing misclicks when sliding adjacent to a wall, and giving a short grace period before a game over.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T07:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24f/24f41d4cddc133745eaabfe71b80bd42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["megabyte112"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
