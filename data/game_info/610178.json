Which really isn\u2019t much more than an environment at the moment, something I cooked up just for fun. It's actually a few years old now, too. This was made in 2015 with Unity 5. You can read more about that here.</p>\n<p>I keep thinking about this project, though. The idea still excites me, and I would like to eventually develop it out further. For now, I'd just like to take the opportunity to share it with y'all. I know it ain't much, but if it sparks even the smallest amount joy in your heart, then I'll consider the effort worth while.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest. If you enjoyed the experience, maybe consider tossin' a few coin my way.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the support. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:23:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f7f146277688d9651b8a0a8067c597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Nikkolai Davenport"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
