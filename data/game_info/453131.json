Some actions have consequences, where the character can be injured, removing possible choices from play. You can also find items along the way that help them out during the story. Be careful though, some items can only be used once, even if they're used incorrectly, and some even can prevent the character from succeeding in their goal.</p>\n<p>This story is written with twine for initial planning and Renpy for display. It is the first text-based game written by the author for the game jam theme, 'Shelter' on Itch.io.<br/><br/>Artwork and backgrounds are temporary or wip. Please also note that the story is unfinished an it is a prototype. The setting of many routes allows for expansion into chapters if continued. <br/>All character artwork \u00a9empiredog</p>\n<p>Moss background is sourced from Unsplash and can be found here: https://unsplash.com/photos/UKzwR57WE-s<br/>It is a temporary placeholder image.<br/><br/><strong>Notes from the Author:</strong><br/>This is also the first 'game' project that I \u00a0have worked on, i found the jam halfway through and am working on learned two new programs. Constructive criticism is welcomed! Please consider leaving a review! <br/><br/>If you find any issues or bugs please let me know and I'll fix them ASAP! <br/><br/>If the game is well received I will work on it more. :3<br/><br/>Made for week 152 game jam, theme: shelter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:01:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2ed74c44c411a3d0bf27a7b00730d478.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["empiredog"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
