Think games such as R-Type and Gradius in their original pixel art versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>20 minutes of shooting action over nine levels.</li><li>Upgrade ships and unlock ship types and loadouts.</li><li>Randomized elements: each run is slightly different.</li><li>Multiple secret bosses to discover.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>But...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Public domain music because I'm no good with sound- it's a Kevin MacLeod one, also used occasionally by a well known movie reviewer on YouTube (but you can turn it off if that bothers you).</li><li>Barebones controller support.</li><li>No custom key bindings.</li></ul>\n<p>If there is any interest, I will probably fix these.</p>\n<p><strong>What is This Thing?</strong></p>\n<p>This\u00a0 game has been a forever project that I have spent a lot of time working on over the years on and off.\u00a0 I started it long enough ago that it was created\u00a0in GameMaker Studio 1! Working at this has helped me get better at\u00a0pixel art and helped me get to understand game design concepts.\u00a0 It has been fun seeing it grow organically as I added more bits.\u00a0 Now it's gotten too complex, with too many moving parts to grow much further. It would be difficult to update the art style in line with my new art and\u00a0too annoying to work at the high-resolution that I first decided on.\u00a0It is time to put the project\u00a0 to bed and start something new, so here is the result. I hope some people\u00a0 stumbling over it on itch.io\u00a0get some enjoyment out of it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Art and code: amberMechanic.</p>\n<p>Sounds made in Sfxr.</p>\n<p>Music: public domain music\u00a0by Kevin MacLeod.</p>\n<p><em>Any helpful critique, especially\u00a0identifying bugs and spelling mistakes is greatly appreciated.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:32:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99d/99d4cacfa67f849b51d680e59695d2e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amber Mechanic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
