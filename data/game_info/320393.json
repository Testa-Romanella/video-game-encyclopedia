In such sub-standard working conditions, it's going to take all of your skill to ensure those crucial penguin deliveries are sent out on time.<br/><br/>And just in case you find yourself laughing derisively at how straightforward you consider that particular task to be, rumour has it that some pesky imposters are attempting to sneak their way into the delivery boxes! Your only defence against these troublesome fraudsters is constant vigilance and a large wooden mallet!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Penguin Factory is a puzzle game with deceptively simple controls. The game contains a number of weird and wonderful contraptions, each of which can either be turned on or off, or can have its direction changed. And that\u2019s it. Your task is to get every penguin safely into a delivery box by getting each piece of equipment working in the right way at the right time. When the delivery boxes are full, and any imposter penguins are \"dealt with\", your task is complete!<br/><br/>The game contains 100 challenging levels. There\u2019s also a level editor to allow you to design and share your own puzzles.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f34213efedeb18cd8ab002cd8ec2172e.jpg", "website": "http://www.battenbergsoftware.com/Game?code=tpf", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Battenberg Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Battenberg Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
