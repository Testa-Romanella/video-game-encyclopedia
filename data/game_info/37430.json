It is the first game in the series to be developed by Telltale.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The main characters are a humanoid dog in a suit named Sam and a rabbit that goes by the name of Max. In their adventure, they will investigate the business of a former television star of the seventies, Brady Culture, that practices hypnosis.</p>\n<p>The game begins with a call in the office of Sam and Max, but the phone is stolen by the rat named Jimmy Two-Teeth. Upon recovering it, it appears that the call was from the owner of a local shop. The protagonists start on their adventure.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Sam &amp; Max is a point-and-click adventure game. The players navigate the world by clicking on a spot where they want to move the character. There are numerous hotspots in the game&#39;s world, with which the characters can interact with. When the cursor is placed over a hotspot, it gets highlighted, and its name will appear if their appearance turned on in the game&#39;s settings. </p>\n<p>You solve puzzles during the game by logically interacting with the environment, participating in dialogue with over characters and collecting and using the items that you pick up and put in your inventory.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s environment is heavily inspired by the 1970s. That can be seen in the clothing the characters wear, the guns and other items in the in-game world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f3/8f33142dd75fdd6897efc06aadbe7aab.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax", "rating": 3.31, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 933, "beaten": 68, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 75, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
