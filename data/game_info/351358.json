It takes place in a world that has been conquered by genetically altered vegetation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With the aim of ending world hunger a group of scientists created \u201cThe Life Algorithm\", a genetic evolution process that accelerates vegetation growth.<br/>The outcome was not the expected, the genetic modification transformed plants into monsters with a threatening appearance and intelligence of their own. In a matter of days, mother nature took revenge and the civilization collapsed.<br/>Only a small group of people were able to escape the destruction by using the S.M.A. (Advanced Withering System) to create OA515, an artificial desert able to repel the vegetation\u2019s attacks. <br/>However, seventeen years after the catastrophe, the S.M.A. is starting to fail and the survivors are in danger.<br/><br/>ZAND<br/>A hero willing to head into this inhospitable world with the aim of fixing the S.M.A. and saving what is left of humankind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ENEMIES<br/>The genetic alteration transformed plants into monsters with a threatening size and appearance, and due to the fact that they are gifted with intelligence and superhuman strength they are impossible to destroy. <br/>You will need all your skills to use the environment to your advantage and be able to move forward.<br/><br/>EXPLORATION <br/>Venture into scenarios full of threatening vegetation which will do everything to stop you.<br/>You will start at the safety of the desert, then move forward into the jungle of the unknown. You will then discover diverse ecosystems inhabited by never seen before altered flora.<br/><br/>GAME MECHANICS<br/>In G.R.E.E.N. \u201cThe Life Algorithm\" you cannot kill. The key factor is using the environment to your advantage.<br/>You have to figure out how to use your enemies once they are petrified: turn them into platforms or transform them into projectiles. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>KEY FEATURES:<br/>-Single player Puzzle / Metroidvania in 2D style.<br/>-Innovative petrification mechanics where you will paralyze your enemies to use them to your advantage and solve the puzzles.<br/>-A unique and captivating hand-drawn art style depicting a cruel and mutated mother nature.<br/>-Machine Learning: Enemy AI is trained to obtain less predictable behaviors.<br/>-Live a story that will show you the cruel and ruthless face of nature.<br/>-Enjoy an original soundtrack with Synthwave / RetroWave music.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MACHINE LEARNING<br/>\"G.R.E.E.N. The Life Algorithm\" is the first videogame in Latin America to implement Tensorflow and ML-Agents of Unity tools for enemy intelligence.<br/>The enemies use different types of artificial intelligence: State Machine, Behavior Trees and Machine Learning. <br/>The first two are reactive intelligence, where the behavior of the enemies depends on the intention of the programmer. With Machine Learning the behavior of enemies depends on independent learning training. This will create more unpredictable situations, generating a greater challenge for the player who will be literally faced with an intelligent machine.<br/><br/>SOUNDTRACK<br/>The G.R.E.E.N. soundtrack style is Synthwave/RetroWave.<br/>The soundtrack will be composed by Oliver Maga\u00f1a with the direction of Salvatore Vitale. Both have over 20 years of experience in the music industry.<br/>The themes have been selected in a way that the digital sounds belong to our hero which contrast the analog sounds that represent the enemies.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d6cb8ecc36b8b4dd7fb3e6253b685cf.jpg", "website": "https://estacionpi.mx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Estacion Pi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Estacion Pi"], "esrb_rating": null}
