Our aim was to build a simple shop system that would allow the player to make purchases using an in-game currency.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Design</em></strong><br/>The project is intended to act as a small section of an RPG; the player comes across a tiny shop in a forest, which allows them to purchase some necessities and rest during their journey.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Implementation</em></strong><br/>The player is able to open the shop by using the 'E' key when they enter a collision box attached to the shop; once the shop interface is open they become unable to move and the mouse cursor becomes visible to allow the player to make purchases.\u00a0At the start of the game, the player\u00a0has 100 pieces of gold which decrease with every purchase made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The items available for sale are stored in a data table; they are each displayed in the shop interface through widgets that are created by iterating through the table.</p>\n\n<p>When the player attempts to make a purchase, the game verifies whether they have the amount of gold necessary; if they do not, an error message is displayed for a couple of seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Once the player closes the shop, they are able to move their character again.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Assets<br/></em></strong>This projects makes use of the Advanced Village Pack\u00a0available in the Unreal Marketplace.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T14:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27f0bd1a3b513bf4203057c288adca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nico Oprescu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
