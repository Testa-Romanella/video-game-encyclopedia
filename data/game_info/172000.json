You control this game only with the keyboard: the commands will be prompted when necessary.</p>\n<p>Most of the pictures are from Hokusai, or other japanese painters. The music is an original composition by myself.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game, as I have enjoyed making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f320fc6a6f518cd2f5f4d08716544a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sergio Longoni"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
