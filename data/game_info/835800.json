You were sent to investigate and quickly noticed a bizarre energy reading. Before you could react, you were sucked into a small pocket of space where increasingly intense waves of the asteroids continue to appear. Destroy as many of them as you can, upgrade your ship and survive.</p><p>Asteroid Survivors is a simple twin-stick shooter in the style of Asteroids. The game is divided into 1-minute waves of increasing intensity and complexity. Between each wave, you can upgrade your ship in various ways using the score accumulated from destroying asteroids. Try to survive to wave 10!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a268ebf6101ab277aa96900f1dd58ea1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["qwarq"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
