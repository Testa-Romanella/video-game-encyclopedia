All you need to do to escape is find the 3 key card pieces but it isn't going to be simple. The house changes over time. It will be locking and unlocking doors and making objects appear or disappear. There is also some metal suits lying in here but I am sure they won't hurt you. Figure out why you are here and escape the house.</p>\n<p>Includes</p>\n<ul><li>6 Nights</li><li>1 - 2 hours of content</li></ul>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>W,A,S and D keys to move<br/>Left Shift to run<br/>Left Mouse to interact with/pick up objects<br/>Right Mouse to turn ON/OFF the Flashlight<br/>Space to drop objects<br/>Hold Escape to quit the night</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02ca1b22289495a6d2ff5137b35ef84a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TeekyBird"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
