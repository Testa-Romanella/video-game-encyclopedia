It was really fun and I do miss those times.<br/></p>\n<p>Building it to WebGL wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, and it actually made me spend several hours to fix a lot of things. So, if you encounter any bugs, as it is bound to happen (hahaha), contact me!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-15T03:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/1436c1eb94b2bd9b049204c049aa59b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ninjabes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
