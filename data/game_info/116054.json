The dungeon you run around in is a placeholder mostly. I'm still working on the camera there too. The starting cabin is closer to finished.</p><p>If you love jrpgs you probably will like this game.<br/></p><p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to move. Bring up the menu with ESC. There is <em>some</em> controller support. Each time you level up, your stats are fully restored. You can save the game using the bed in the cabin.</p><p>There isn't a way to \"win\" just yet. More content will be added in the future.</p><p>And a huge thanks to Radiarc for the battle theme and the dungeon theme!</p><p><strong>- 0.0.2 Update -</strong></p><ul><li>added cancel button to status menu screen</li><li>fixed a player movement bug</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/9321666beec3eaf1a14a2851f59d3c29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["polisummer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
