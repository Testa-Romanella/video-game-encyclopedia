The game is set between volume 22 and 23 of the manga; right after Guts and Puck depart for Elfhelm with Casca, but before Farnese, Serpico, and Isidro catch up with them. The music is composed by Susumu Hirasawa, who also composed the anime series&#39; music.<br />\nReleased around the same time as Shenmue, Sword of the Berserk is notable for its early use of quick time events (QTE). It used these to determine the different non-linear paths the player would take, depending on whether they succeed or fail in pressing the displayed button quickly enough during a QTE, allowing different ways to complete the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T08:42:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/20f/20f591fd2f8e4b938c20f472c1b5cdef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.12, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Yuke's Co"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
