Wait no longer!</p>\n<p>Roll your way through over thirty encounters with careful aim and thoughtful strategy. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of different enemies as you\u00a0battle your way through a Gothic citadel.

Try using as smooth a motion as possible, but experiment!</li><li>There is a decent amount of skill involved and you have to figure out how the dice physics. It's possible to land 90% of them in the attack zone.</li></ul></li><li>Click on dice once you've rolled them to \"activate\" them</li><li>\u00a0Activating a die has different effects based on what\u00a0<strong>zone</strong> it's in: the blue zone on the left is a basic attack, but you'll add different zones throughout the game.</li><li>If you miss and land in the black \"deadzone\", you have to activate the die to get it back.</li><li>You can only activate one die a turn (to start with).</li><li>The top screen has your health (in red, above character)\u00a0and the enemies you're battling against. Defeat them to move on to the next encounter.</li><li>You will heal and upgrade your character\u00a0at rest stations.</li><li>If you die, the game ends (sorry, a checkpoint system really would have eaten up the time).</li></ul>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming, design, and development by Evan J.
