Drainage Dreams was created in completion for our Game Studio course project. The game was designed to be a multi-genre 2D platformer game with each level consisting of different game elements and mechanics that are unique from one another. The development of the current prototype is roughly around 3 months which includes the conceptual phase, implementation phase and the testing phase. <br/></p>\n<p>We hope that you all enjoy the game and have a good time with it!
