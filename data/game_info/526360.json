To play, click and drag anywhere on the screen to launch the rocket. The angle at which you release the rocket will be the direction it is launched in, and the aim is to land on the moon. If you are travelling too fast (the speed is higher than in the green area on the speedometer), you will crash! To score a point, land safely on the moon without crashing by launching at an angle and speed that will take you close enough to just orbit the moon without crashing directly.<br/>More points can be earned by consecutive successful trips between the earth and the moon. Watch out for asteroids!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:37:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/3846b6a3645b3d435d5882f0775e8def.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Trymunx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
