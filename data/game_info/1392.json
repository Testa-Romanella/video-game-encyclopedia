A city run by a secret society of masked Lords who rule with shady back-door dealings and unmatched political power. In Lords of Waterdeep players will play as one of these masked Lords and will need to recruit adventurers to go out and complete quests for them. The more quests they complete, the more control and influence they have over the city. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers can expand the city by purchasing buildings that will open up new opportunities within the city walls. Intrigue cards can be used to help the player and may also either help or hinder their fellow Lords in their quest to become the supreme ruler of Waterdeep!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLords of Waterdeep is a turn-based strategy game played in 8 rounds and can be played against AI or with up to 5 human players. Players take turns assigning their agents to do their bidding, whether it is to recruit new adventurers to their tavern or purchase a new building for the city. Points and resources are gained by completing quests, playing Intrigue cards, constructing new buildings or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed. At the end of the 8 rounds bonus points are awarded and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022\tComputer opponents and asynchronous cross platform multiplayer online play<br/>\r\n\u2022\tOptions for 2-5 players (6 players with the Undermountain or Scoundrels of Skullport expansions)<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAI Opponents<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAsynchronous or real-time online play (2-5 players)<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAbility to invite Playdek friends to matches<br/>\r\n\u2022\tPublic or Private online profile statistics<br/>\r\n\u2022\tSelectable online game clocks<br/>\r\n\u2022\t\"Next game\" button takes you to your next asynchronous online game<br/>\r\n\u2022\tIn-game tutorial<br/>\r\n\u2022\tRule Book and Card Gallery to review game text and effects<br/>\r\n\u2022\tOptions for Music and SFX and animation speed<br/>\r\n\u2022\tAnimated backgrounds<br/>\r\n\u2022\tPlayer ratings system<br/>\r\n\u2022\tOther player's Online status indicator<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*AN INTERNET CONNECTION AND PLAYDEK ACCOUNT ARE REQUIRED FOR ONLINE PLAY.*<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPer our Terms of Service, you must be 13 years old or older to use the Playdek online games service.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/646c7484826cc20c25127294dbf42822.jpeg", "website": "http://www.playdekgames.com", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 61, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Playdek"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Playdek"], "esrb_rating": null}
