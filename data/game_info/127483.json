She can shoot the matches with her watergun and has to extinguish them all before they reach their objective.</p><p>Controls :</p><p>(Xbox layout)<br/></p><p>Matches : move with the left stick, press A to turn blue if you're lost (you will be) - Avoid water at all cost!</p><p>Grandma : aim with the left stick, load water with LT and/or RB, shoot water with A.
