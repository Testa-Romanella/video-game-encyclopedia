To complete your quest, you will be equipped with a high-tech and lavish arsenal which evolves according to the increasing difficulty of the game. You can discover these weapons in detail in the section Factory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach decor has been carefully crafted up to the last detail, a subtle blend of modernity and classicism, like a mid-21st century Paris. The experience also includes multiple animation styles and special effects that reinforce the sense of immersion and presence while participating in a storytelling. We also put a lot of effort into the overall fluidity of the game, optimizing each 3D object to guarantee a minimum of 90 FPS.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b53c2b34f1cf58e2fc71472fdc99d926.jpg", "website": "https://www.singularity5.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monochrome Paris"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monochrome Paris"], "esrb_rating": null}
