Ruebsaat!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Mediator is a take on a witch in a more animist sense based on my own animist beliefs as taught to me during my teens. This should offer a new perspective on witchcraft along with what is possible to accomplish with magic and how to help keep a community safe and secure. The Mediator is a witch who shares power, tales, and consequences with the Haven they are a part of. What languages do you speak, who do you converse with, what is your own secret pain?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The World's Heart is the pumping primal soul in everything. We are all connected from birth to death. Take what you need and only what you need, seek community over fights, and bring the world together rather than rip it apart. When everyone is your brother and sister you must think hard on the ramifications of violence while being unwavering if it comes down to that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These two pieces should add new vigor to your world of Haven. Even if you only use one or the other they can heavily enhance the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c36/c362ebd81b0f510e04a23b3fc6e9cf0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
