Defend your own house from the powers that would take it from you.  Or, choose to defend some of the more iconic locations throughout the globe; it's your choice.  Care to defend the Seattle Space Needle?  Or perhaps Washington, DC itself?  Or the liquor store just around the corner?  The choice is yours.  But be ready - 'cause they certainly are.<br/><br/>World Defense is the first, physics based, 3d tower defense where anything and everything depends upon real world simulations.<br/><br/>Additionally, World Defense incorporates Fragmented Reality (tm) where you can move objects from the real world into your game and make them part of the action!
