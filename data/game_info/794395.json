Its inspired by the souls series and has some souls-like mechanics. Its a simple game where you can fight any multitude of enemy combos (amount and difficulty).</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD </strong>to move</li><li><strong>LEFT CLICK</strong> to attack.</li><li><strong>F\u00a0</strong>to block/parry an enemy. If timed correctly the victim will be stunned and damage to you will be nullified.</li><li><strong>SPACEBAR </strong>to dash. Dashing gives you a boost and gives you iframes (invincibility frames). If a dash is timed correctly you can completely block an enemies attack.</li></ul>\n<p>Combining a mix of blocks, dashes, dodges, and attacks can give you an advantage over your enemies. Try mixing up your play styles too.</p>\n<p>The purple bar below your health bar is the cooldown for blocking. When the purple bar is full your block is ready.</p>\r\nUpdates:\r\n<p>I am actively working on this game. I will push out updates at least every week. If not I'm busy. Any suggestions in the comments is appreciated and will be considered in future updates.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e41def4260c43d82d645ee6636ae1fce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cors_error"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
