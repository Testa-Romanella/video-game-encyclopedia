I ran out of time unfortunately (started on the last day).\r\n </p>\n<p>The idea was that there would be multiple floors and enemies the  player had to fight on/with. If the player manages to survive the wave,  they go down to the lower floor. If the player is killed, they go back  to the previous floor, hence \"death is only the beginning\" in its  literal meaning.\r\n </p>\n<p>I made a global timescale that I wanted to use to slow down  everything to a halt, and proceed to the next/previous level in a cool  animation in front of the camera where the enemies and projectiles would  go into a gradual slowmo. But because I ran out of time, there's just  the one level and I didn't really have time to figure out the logistics  of it, so to say. You can still see it taking effect when you win/lose.\r\n If you're wondering why I'd make my own global timescale factor  instead of using the Time.timeScale (this project is made in Unity),  that's because Unity's timeScale is completely global and denies me any  choice on what it affects and when. With my own scale factor, I have  total control over it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:42:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/006e5def4e9fdb3835cd12c597f5ff67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shenawy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
