Help her escaping the facility, jump back and forth in time and solve the puzzles to overcome the obstacles and reach the freedom! Plus, Mila will be able to use her <em>timegun</em> in the future to send objects back in time, using their earlier forms in the present and in the past to get out of troubles and untangle the most difficult enigmas.\u00a0Because remember: as the \"Butterfly Effect\" teaches, even small changes in the past can have huge consequences in the future. So whatever you\u2019ll do, mind the consequences across time!\u00a0<em>The Butterfly Effect </em>is a game created for the 2017/2018 Videogame Design and Programming course, held at Politecnico di Milano, and it is part of the Polimi Game Collective.
