Will you trust them?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Insecure Bonding\r\n<p>Insecure Bonding is a 2 player game about trust, where both players control a single character. Each player is given the role of a Knower or Mover, which alternates every time the character is moved a tile. The premise is simple; the player who has the most points by the time the character reaches the end, wins. But be careful: If anyone reaches 0 points, both players lose!\r\n<br/>\n<br/>The roles are as follows: The Knower knows what each surrounding tile does, while the Mover is responsible for moving the player character. Both players can see their own scores at any time by clicking \u201cShow Secret\u201d, but make sure to look away if it\u2019s not your secret!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n<p>Henrik Nilsson\r\n<strong>Game Design</strong><strong>Programmer</strong></p>\n<p>Martin Zetterman\r\n<strong>Game Design</strong><strong>Audio</strong><strong>Artist</strong></p>\n<p>James Young-Rogers\r\n<strong>Game Design</strong><strong>Artist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process\r\n<p>This game was made in 2 weeks during the Experimental Games course at Uppsala University with the theme being Trust.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T18:55:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb9548a66179b4e357085516ff21f6e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["snurlsss", "MartinZetterman", "Henrik"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
