It allows you to control exactly what its name suggests: choose which artists to enroll, which currents to follow, which art forms to develop, and your arts society might soar! The adventure begins in 1799 with founding figures such as Francisco Goya or Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, and hits the 21st century with Beyonc\u00e9 and Bong Joon-Ho. Each artist has several different effects on the society's influence, so it's all about building a viable and diverse collective with a solid synergy! It is a solo project by Antoine Ramo</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>How does it work, exactly\u00a0? </strong>(the in-game tutorial provides most of these facts)</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong>\u00a0To make the cards and the information panel easier to read, you can enlarge them at any moment by maintaining your mouse's right button.</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n<strong>The Artists.</strong>\r\nThere are 20 different domains, ranging from painting to video games.\r\nThese are unlocked one at a time. Each domain is divided into 5\r\ndistinct eras, and each era unlocks 10 artists. If you want to enroll\r\none, 5 possibilities will be randomly picked among the unlocked\r\nartists of the corresponding domain. You may then pick your favorite,\r\nor pay to redraw if none suits you. Artists who belong to a specific\r\ncurrent may be unavailable until you have unlocked it. Once unlocked,\r\nit can be upgraded, and the artists linked to it will have their\r\noutput amplified.</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n<strong>The Output.</strong>\r\nYour society's influence is divided into 4 different variables\u00a0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tCultural impact, which allows you to unlock more domains\r\n\t</li><li>\r\n\tAesthetic impact, which allows you to unlock more artists\r\n\t</li><li>\r\n\tParadigmatic impact, which allows you to unlock more currents, and\r\n\tlater, bonuses\r\n\t</li><li>\r\n\tSocial impact, which isn't a number but a gauge. It has an influence\r\n\ton the other 3 impacts\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u2022\r\n<strong>The Effects.</strong>\r\nEach individual artist has 3 or 4 effects out of the hundreds\r\navailable. These effects can influence artists from certain areas,\r\ncurrents, domains, regarding any of the different impacts. For each\r\ndomain, an artist can be chosen as a trendsetter. Their peers will\r\nthen amplify their effects. There is also a small number of seats\r\navailable for global trendsetters.</p>\n<p>\u2022\r\n<strong>The Ethics.</strong>\r\nSeveral factors affect the gauge that measures your society's social\r\nimpact\u00a0: if you fail to gather a diverse group, your impact will be very limited, and may even become negative. On the contrary, if some of your artists are also\r\nactivists, it may help a lot\u00a0! Finally, in addition to the 1000\r\navailable artists, there are 50 shameful influences which may show up\r\nand make things difficult for you. They're icons such as Picasso,\r\nDisney, Stravinsky or Lovecraft, and they have a history of abuse or\r\nfascism. If you just let them here, it will lower your social impact.\r\nIf you sacrifice some aesthetic impact to banish them, your social impact will rise.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>The\r\nInterfaces.</strong> In addition\r\nto the game interface, a list interface can be accessed by clicking\r\nthe stats panel. It allows you to browse through your complete list\r\nof artists. You can sort it as you like by clicking any of the column\r\ntitles (name, era, domain, currents, tags, gender, effects). To make\r\nthe game more accessible, in both interfaces, a right click can be\r\nused to enlarge a card, or the information panel, so that it is\r\neasier to read.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Wiki\u00a0-\u00a0Twitter\u00a0-\u00a0Presskit</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T13:31:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e1441f2af4d4dfce81a77dae08a1897e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ramo"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
