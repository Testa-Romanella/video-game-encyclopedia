My first attempt at any type of GameJam.<br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/about-ten-years<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a young gent who goes off in search of a lost loved one. The journey alone costs dearly, but as you reach the end of the game, you realise there might be something more sinister going on.<br/></p>\n<p>I guess it's somewhat like a 2D walking simulation, with the narrative happening as you walk around. Sadly with the time constrains I wasn't able to add in all the story elements I wanted to. So it's a bit choppy. And there are a few bugs, which I will fix in a later release. I feel the story deserves a little TLC before I put it to bed!</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes:<br/></strong>Fixed the jellybean counter not resetting<br/>Fixed issue with colliders<br/>Fixed missing transitions issue<br/></p>\n<p>Anyhow... I hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e9d8360476844bb289315bd09b0b09c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Odd Socks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
