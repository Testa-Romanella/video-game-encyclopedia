The amount of upgrades you can get is limited by the amount of enemies you've defeated. But keep in mind that enemies also get stronger the further you get.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Trijam #144 in 3 hours. The theme was \"Life line\", but I couldn't think of anything other than grappling hooks, which I used in my last game, so I generated a random theme, which ended up being \"generations\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:43:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/453/453fb1c86ec5bab19ff9dd62bb93fb1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monkosum"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
