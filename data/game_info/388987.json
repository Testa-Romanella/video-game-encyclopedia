This UFO-shaped structure was built in the 1970s to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the founding of Bulgaria's Social Democratic party. After 7 difficult years of construction, the monument was officially opened to the public in August 1981. For the next 8 years, it was used as the headquarters of the communist party. <br/><br/>However, in November 1989 Bulgaria ceased to be a Communist State and the building was promptly closed down. After years of disuse and with no further maintenance, the abandoned structure began to quickly deteriorate and suffer from acts of vandalism.<br/>Thanks to the building\u2019s unusual design and unique location, it did not take long for Buzludzha to become one of Europe\u2019s most iconic abandoned sites. It continuously attracts urban explorers from all around the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcc/fcc5dd0647d1e10add62c4189e088462.jpg", "website": "https://buzludzhavr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Augmade"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Augmade"], "esrb_rating": null}
