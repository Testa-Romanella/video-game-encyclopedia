Previous deaths* leave new platforms that can be used for a slight boost, or, with the help of <em>strange unidentified fluids</em>, even a big boing or a slimy climb!<br/></p>\n<p>*No skeleton actually dies, their bones go to a secret skelly hideout.

(Once again, cheated with the palette slightly with the liquids... but imagine how hard it would be to tell which one\u00a0was which!!)</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will this game be updated?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A: I've loved making it so far, I don't see why I should suddenly stop once it's been released!! we'll see :))</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What about the skeletons that 'die' in different ways??? (lava etc)</strong></p>\n<p>A: They always find a way to get their\u00a0bones back! Skellies are immune to lava, they just kinda sink...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone mentioned elsewhere in this description!</p>\n<p>Font: Kongtext</p>\n<p>pefeper\u00a0on youtube for the gravity/jumping code! &lt;3\r\n</p>\n<p>KidsCanCode on youtube for brilliant tutorials on sweet features (fade-in/out on switch levels, etc)\r\n</p>\n<p>The GOATs on the\u00a0godot forums &lt;33</p>\n<p>The folks behind the godot game engine\u00a0(what i used to make this game!)</p>\n<p>You, the player (c'mon, what game doesn't do that?)\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>The semi-serious part at the bottom of the page:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is my second publically released game and my first game jam submission. It's been a blast! The jam time limit and community encouragement motivated me throughout the development process, which, in my opinion, resulted in a pretty damn good game for someone who\u2019s only been developing games for a few months\u00a0under a year\u00a0from the start of the jam!</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to Kosmotion for hosting the newbie game jam and helping introduce me to jamming, an event that I was somewhat anxious about joining!<em> If you are considering doing your first or another\u00a0jam yourself and have the time for it, go for it! :)\u00a0</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47d/47df18adab580037c36d7b8af7d1caff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skullbuns"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
