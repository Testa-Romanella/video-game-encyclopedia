A Hat in Time is a 3D platformer where you play as \"Hat Kid\" and can use an assortment of hats to use different abilities.\u00a0In a Hat in Time activating the Fox mask would make intangible and translucent blocks and walls become solid. So our team decided to remake this mechanic in a 2D environment.</p>\n<p>Credits: Stefan Small, Dio Su, Nico Forero, and Daniel Cooper</p>\n<p>Assets: SunnyLand by Ansimuz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/96529b5e7fa4586f5826591ccb022f6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Based_Kami"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
