It includes light puzzle mechanics, but leans more on the platformer side.</p>\n<p>The main focus of this project for me was to finish something and get a feel for the whole process of making a small game, after having worked on some stuff on the side  for about a year now, which wasn't really getting anywhere.</p>\n<p>I aim to release the full version of this game with about 30 levels and some more abilities around April 10.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback, feel free to let me know. It is very much appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5acb5054ac3e2d02d8a4a5a6a23963e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NorkasGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
