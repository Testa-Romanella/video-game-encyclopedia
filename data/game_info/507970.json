I have run a single campaign prior and am actively running a second one: this one.\u00a0Each campaign is designed to be long-running with multiple choices that impact the shape of the world. The players will control the future.\u00a0To accommodate a variety of play styles, Cycles of Infinity is a world that uses the trope of cyclic catastrophe; the world gets reset by cataclysmic events every few centuries or millenniums. These cycles do not seem to be preordained to the laymen, but they have a massive effect on the world. Like similar settings with this mechanic, each cycle is built on the ruins of the last cycle, and so a mismatch of genres, technology, and magic, all exist.\u00a0Cycles of Infinity hosts numerous gods, multiple pathways to magic, and no restrain on technology. Depending on when the players play, the world could host almost any genre.</p>\n\r\nSands Of Slumber\r\n<p>This campaign plays in the genre of old Final Fantasy style taking place in a highly magical and steampunk-esque technological world\u00a0on the verge of all out war. This follows the Aasimar: Ashara, Half Elves: Embra and Ish Ma'el, and Marleek (custom race): Victalyassa as they join up in the Unnamed Guild, led by a Dwarf: Drosko, to complete a task for the High King which will put all of their skills and abilities to the test. The heroes meet up outside the city of Valtaska, on the peninsula of Tanaviak , to receive the quest that will start them on a long journey to save the cycle and end the evil machinations of the \"Sand Cult\" and their mysterious plans to bring about the end of the world as they know it. The quest to save the world will bring the heroes all over the peninsula and far beyond as the party interacts with Kings, High Society Nobles, Cultists, Brothel women, Giant Flying Fire Whales,\u00a0the Embodied Gods, and SO. MUCH. MORE.</p>\n<p>Note: Currently, the video game takes place before Session 1, but leads directly into it by the end of the prelude.</p>\n\r\nSystem Note:\r\n<p>The Tabletop RPG is played using Dungeons and Dragons 5e, with the rulesets, D20 system, and all. The Video Game adventure is no different, incorporating all it can from the tabletop to make it as authentic to the way it was originally played as possible. You will meet various races\u00a0and classes of DnD 5e and custom races and classes created by Magenth.\u00a0Though the campaign in the tabletop RPG kicked off with the quest, in the video game\u00a0there will be a prelude which will introduce the players to the various mechanics and types of quests which will be found throughout the game including: D20 combat and skill checks, DnD spells and abilities, and a lot of different plugins credited in the game to present the best experience to players and the most accurate to the tabletop while still remaining a video game with all the considerations... considered. We hope you very much enjoy playing with these characters the same way we do!</p>\n<p>Note: The game is in very early development and the DnD campaign isn't even concluded, so enjoy but know it will be a VERY long time before the story is complete. Updates will only come out after major game breaking bugs that can be replicated can be found and removed or after\u00a0each \"session\" is added to the story. Current version is 1.0 (indicative of Session: 0).</p>\n<p>Thank You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:42:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a16a6eea917b1280b4615298058fb52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoCalAshez"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
