Luckily your local fishing shop is constantly looking to buy fish from you. They are also kind enough to sell upgrades for your boat so that you can catch more expensive fish, as well as protect yourself from the sharks that infest your sea.</p>\n<p>Try and make the most amount of net profit, and survive for as long as you can!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>A/D (or Left and Right Arrow) - Left and Right movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Move the hook</p>\n<p>Left-click - Attempt to catch a fish</p>\n\r\nGoals\r\n<p>Collect as many fish you can during the day, so that when you go to the market, you have the opportunity to make more money.
