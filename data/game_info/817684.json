Existing research suggests that effective solutions should look to <strong>task-share</strong> mental health services with <strong>frontline community providers</strong> to build self-efficacy and competency in a safe environment and improve health equity and trust in vulnerable communities.</p>\n\n<p>In our current prototype, we feature one of four sample cases provided by the Center for Innovation in Mental Health\u00a0at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. Trainees\u00a0from community-based organizations connected to the Harlem Strong Collaborative will encounter\u00a0Jamal, a 24-year-old restaurant worker unaware of mental health resources.\u00a0<strong>HTC Vive eye-tracking</strong> sets Mindsight apart from other video training or role play scenarios with standardized patients by <strong>measuring</strong><strong> whether the trainee could see\u00a0physical indicators of Jamal's\u00a0anxiety during their conversation</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the future, Mindsight could include fleshed out training simulations for Jamal and the three other CUNY cases<strong>:\u00a0</strong>Lasandra, a 42-year-old single mom;\u00a0Maria, a 27-year-old undocumented female; and\u00a0Rachel, a 22-year-old female experiencing domestic abuse. Further developments would incorporate\u00a0other research-backed visual and\u00a0environmental warning signs beyond the body language indicators exhibited in our prototype.</p>\n<p>The Mindsight prototype was developed in 48 hours for the\u00a02022 XR Brain Jam\u00a0hosted by\u00a0Games for Change\u00a0with the prompt \"Promoting Positive Mental Health.\"<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Team 7: The Lucky 7s</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sounak Ghosh\u00a0(Producer and 3D Developer)\r\n</p>\n<p>Ayanna Seals (Research Scientist)</p>\n<p>Sanjit Singh (3D Developer)</p>\n<p>Sondra Phifer (Instructional Designer and 3D Artist)</p>\n<p>Mercedes Hesselroth\u00a0(Narrative and Interaction Designer)</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Dr.\u00a0Victoria Ngo, PhD, MS.</p>\n<p><strong>The prototype is currently supported only on the HTC Vive Pro Eye.</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T15:08:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0beefda074196f36d78e476cb123d21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunkengames", "musicworm"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
