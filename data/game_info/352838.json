Your objective is quite simple, beat the AI and win the match.<br/>The goal of this demo is to validate the unit control mechanics (which is complicated\u00a0 and demand a lot of effort).</p>\n<p>Note: all sounds, musics and some 3D assets are free content and I don't own them. They'll be replaced.</p>\n<p><strong>MEDIA<br/></strong>TigSource DevLog:\u00a0https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=65558.0<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/alltoohumangame<br/>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpncwk1vJPAiG2bbny4J3yw</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong>- mouse left button to select/deselect units;<br/>- mouse right button to give orders to the selected unit;<br/>- mouse wheel to zoom in/out;<br/>- mouse middle button to rotate the camera;<br/>- keyboard arrows or W/A/S/D keys to move the camera;<br/>- Q/E or Del/End to rotate the camera;<br/>- Z/X or PageUp/PageDown to zoom in/out.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>Created and coded by Lucas Teixeira<br/>UI and additional art by Gabriel Marcon<br/>Additional testing by Daniel Teixeira</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/070/0708aea278c1d11f2bbc4363ff82e0c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lucas Teixeira"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
