You must find and pass through the Dark Realm gate to fight it. However, the keys to the gate have been scattered across the forest and across the departing realms. Departing realms are parallel dimensions, each a step towards death. Be careful!</p>\n<p>This game was developed in about 10 days during the month of November 2017 for the GitHub Game\u00a0Off jam. The big hook idea was the \"demake\" departing realms, each representing the game in lower fidelity, roughly approximating different bit platforms.</p>\n<p>Music jammed out by Hryx. About 40 hours of development was streamed on Twitch and archived on YouTube.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Best played with a gamepad, but keyboard and mouse also works.</p>\n\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Hold fire to pull back arrow without shooting.</li><li>Hit 3 enemies in a row to get a bomb arrow shot.</li><li>Turn up audio to hear approaching enemies.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/803f961a6bdad62f043ef397b7c54b38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["progrium"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
