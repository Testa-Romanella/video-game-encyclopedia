It seems to help. However, I may have fixed this. The music can however still get a bit glitchy if there are many enemies onscreen at once)<br/></p>\n<p>(My first attempt at this game jam wasn't working out, so I quickly threw this together instead within the last 24 hours)</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to move. Click once to make sure the audio will work. Other than that, no clicking required!</p>\n<p>Avoid red enemies, they'll slow you down.<br/></p>\n<p>Collect green squares to charge up your invincibility. It will activate when the bar is full.</p>\n<p>While invincible, smash red enemies to speed up and keep your invincibility meter charged. Collecting more Green squares will also help keep it charged.</p>\n<p>When your invincibility wears off, you level up! It will then take longer to charge your invincibility next time, but it will also last longer.</p>\n<p>There's no way to lose, so have fun\u00a0 trying to build up speed and smashing into enemies. Once you get moving fast enough, you can essentially revel in watching the game play itself.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br/>- Click game to make it active, then mouse to move<br/>- Red = bad (except when you're invincible; then it's good!)<br/>- Green = good<br/>- REFRESH PAGE if audio instruments sound desynced after clicking on the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADAPTIVE MUSIC INFO:</strong></p>\n<p>There's a basic backing track that plays all the time, mostly just for a bit of ambiance and rhythm for the other tracks to sync to. It's intended to suggest that although things are currently fairly uneventful in-game, the player is still moving and making a small amount of progress.<br/></p>\n<p>Each green powerup plays a light-hearted whistly tune to let you know they're friendly and uplifting, and these should hopefully stay in sync with the backing track.<br/></p>\n<p>Each red enemy that comes along will be accompanied by some marching-band-y wind instruments, to let you know that they mean business. This should also hopefully stay in time with the other music.<br/></p>\n<p>While invincibility is active, a few extra instruments should join in, especially drums, to motivate the player to beat things up and have a good time.</p>\n<p>Smacking enemies while invincible should add some orchestral-ish drums and cymbals to make the player feel powerful and good about themselves, but it doesn't currently work as noticeably as I wanted. Something for me to improve in the future.</p>\n<p>I also played with increasing the music tempo as the player's speed increased, but this was a bit glitchy and didn't feel polished, so I decided to cut it for now to work on other aspects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THEME: \"At the Edge\"</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(Ehhh. I would've probably fit the theme better if I'd spent more than a day on this entry...)<br/>While invincible, the player is encouraged to constantly fight enemies to maintain their invincibility, at the risk (or \"at the edge\") of their invincibility running out at any time, and the player then\u00a0 bumping an enemy and losing a quarter of the speed they have built up so far.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p><p>Art, music and game by Kooky<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ae/9aefcf3c83f4719e0a90790efdb8ea09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kooky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
