For most of the time I was working on this I for some reason confused the theme for being \"sunken\" instead of \"shipwrecked\". Found the general concept of the game still somewhat worked with the theme so hopefully it should be ok as a submission.</p>\n<p>Submitting this version for now to the jam, need\u00a0to work on making the audio work so it can play, also want to flesh out the characters in the story a bit better to give the game a better and clearer context. It's not any major work so I should be able to finish it properly and update it in not too long a time.</p>\n<p>Music: Palms and Seagulls by Timecrawler 82, found on freemusicarchive.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:21:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dcaee9f12eb1ef8a54d6c698553acb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leafeon247"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
