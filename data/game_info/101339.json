Every battle \r\nencountered is a one-on-one duel to the death, and the levels are \r\ndesigned to require multiple play-throughs to see all of its bizarre \r\nsecrets, dripping with lore and mystery.</p>\n\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Ancient horrors have descended on the dark, cursed land of South Glenn. \r\nThe Emperor has sent one man to investigate: Grey, a skilled swordsman \r\nwith a blood-stained past. Mutated creatures and tragic victims of the \r\nspreading blight stand in the way of a twisted plot that threatens the \r\nentire world\u2026 can Grey find the root of evil and help the people of this\r\n land?</em></p>\n\n\n<p><em>As Grey, your journey will lead you through tombs and catacombs, castles<br/> and caves on a quest to destroy the source of all this chaos - <strong>the truth of which will shock the empire!</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>\n<p>Vanquish over 25 unique enemies including 14 brutal bosses to save South<br/> Glenn from an evil ruler and other much darker ancient evils!</p>\n<p><em>\n<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The gameplay is as challenging as they come with no levels or power-ups,\r\n just your own skill against legions of unique enemies.
