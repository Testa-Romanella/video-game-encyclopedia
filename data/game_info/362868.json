You are the best Special Forces soldier the original President has at his disposal. The clones are running amok and threatening to prevent the President getting to his golf game with Vlad. They must be stopped before they can wall-in the President and escape in his helicopter!<br/><br/><strong>No Brainer</strong><br/><br/>Like the President himself, this game is a no-brainer! Just shoot or bludgeon the hell out of the clones and their wall! Replenish your health and ammo then keep blasting away. Be sure to wear your Sly Stallone lop-sided shooting face while you play and remember to scream: \"Die, you mothers!\" until your actual mother walks in the room!<br/><br/>Political satire and carnage at its most gloriously basic best!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/942211718dc2e6b7521eb218969e6703.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julian Henley"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Julian Henley"], "esrb_rating": null}
