It's ancient and rich and it looms over the world of magic like no other institution humanity has ever made.<br/><br/>And this is what you need to know to make it through your freshman year:<br/><br/>Watch out for Mineta, the oldest, greatest, meanest city in the world. There are gangs. There\u2019s a thieves\u2019 guild \u2013 or maybe several, depending on how you look at it. There are conspirators trying to drive our good Captain out of high office, and there\u2019s our Captain trying to drive conspiracies nuts. There are crazy wizards and bickering vampires and haunted restaurants and Gods only know what else. The city is a mess.<br/><br/>Also, watch out for the Imperial Reserve. That whole place was left to brew in its own shadows since the Empire of Man shook itself apart \u2013 and, honestly, it wasn\u2019t exactly safe even when the Empire was at its peak. The old forest is full of monsters and trapped tombs and fey politics and more crazy wizards, and the old Imperial Palace\u2026 well, it\u2019s the size of a city all on its own, and it\u2019s still straining to contain all its ghosts and twitchy soldiers and skulking bandits.<br/><br/>And the Sphinx. Best you don\u2019t even think about the Sphinx.<br/><br/>The skies are mostly dominated by air pirates on enchanted ships of war. All the other flying islands that make up civilization as we know it? Just as bad as ours, only with worse food. And, of course, off at the fringes are the Dragons: the scaly old creatures that enslaved humanity, shattered the first generation of Gods, and are now just waiting for the chance to pick up where they left off.<br/><br/>I\u2019d say it\u2019s safer to explore the Academy of Mineta itself, but let\u2019s be real: the school\u2019s seventeen hundred years old, and it\u2019s been the center of wizard uprisings, undead invasions, and Gods know what all else. You have towers frozen in time at the moment of their collapse, you have professors plotting against one another, and you\u2019ll have dynamic, incredibly complicated relationships between the eighty-some students themselves in your year \u2013 and every enemy you make is going to know how to make fireballs with just a stick and a bad attitude. Good luck with all that.<br/><br/>At least you'll have magic too. Incantation, the stuff of magical creation? Try not to entomb the city in a horrific magical winter, but otherwise have fun. Negation, the magic of deflection, evaluation, and stillness? Love it. Glamour, the work of illusionists and con artists and ambitious lovers of every stripe? It causes problems, but it\u2019s legal enough. Revision, turning things into other things? Nobody\u2019s going to complain if you fix a tear in your shirt or make your shoe the size of a house. Artifice, the art of enchantment \u2013 well, that\u2019s what makes the city work. That and Astrology, the magic of turning the rules of the stars around for your own benefit.<br/><br/>Gates and Mastery, though? Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t. We don\u2019t want invading armies from other planes of existence. We don\u2019t want deranged wizards making innocent people into puppets. Don\u2019t do it, and beware of anyone who does.<br/><br/>It\u2019s a great big world, filled with an incredibly vast number of things to do and places to go and people to impress. There are hundreds of adventures you can have, and literally thousands of abilities and actions and items you can pick up to improve your odds.<br/><br/>**************<br/><br/>Academagia is a 2D PC life simulation and role-playing game intended for audiences ages 9+.
