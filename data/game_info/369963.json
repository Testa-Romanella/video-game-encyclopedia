We also did the hardcore challenge of making the sound effects with your voice! (Huge props to Ryan O\u2019Dea for doing them).</p>\n<p>You play as a fat guy, jumping around bouncing on all the skinny people crushing them to the ground, earning points and trying to survive as long as possible, and if you hit the ground it's game over! Try and beat our high score of 50 points! Even if you do or don't beat it, comment your high score down below!</p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li>Fast-paced, action gameplay!</li><li>Funny concept!</li><li>The game never ends!</li></ul>\r\nSocial\u00a0Media\r\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/NightZardProductions/?modal=admin_todo_tour</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/nightzard</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0<strong>https://www.instagram.com/nightzardproductions/</strong></p>\r\nCredits:\r\nGame Created By:\r\n<p>-\u00a0 Callan Hansen</p>\r\nProgramming:\r\n<p>- Callan Hansen</p>\r\nArt:\u00a0\r\n<p>- Kara Hansen</p>\n<p>- Callan Hansen</p>\r\nMusic &amp; Audio Editing:\u00a0\r\n<p>- Ryan O\u2019Dea</p>\r\nFonts:\r\n<p>BigTeezSq</p>\n<p>Bonk</p>\n<p>ExtraFat</p>\r\nTools used:\r\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Piskel</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Visual Studio 2019</li></ul>\n<p>Game made for the\u00a0'Geta Game Jam 9' game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e9ac797abe861c82d1569981be54e55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["NightZard Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
