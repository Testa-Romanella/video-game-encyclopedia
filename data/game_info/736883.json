The moving speed of the ball varies in different levels. I tried to make the icy textures on the ground.\r\n</p>\n<p>In LEVEL 1, I explore the \u201cBoolean\u201d function in Probuilder to make the holes on the surface that the player needs to avoid. In LEVEL 2, the surfaces are smaller and have no walls. The player needs to press the key and control the ball carefully to prevent it from falling out of the edges. I also change the perspective of the camera to explore more experiences. In LEVEL 3, the ball goes back to the start point when it hits the wall. Move the ball slowly and collect the yellow gems to destroy the obstacle.\r\n</p>\n<p>Textures: Unsplash</p>\n<p>Diamond Models: Sketchfab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b4/2b45e4245dc28a3441f4c20526ff149a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aaangelaZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
