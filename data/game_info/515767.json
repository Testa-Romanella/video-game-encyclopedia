This was my first time actually completing a game. I used RPGMaker\u00a0MV.</p>\n<p>This project was made for me and someone's 1-v-1 48 hour Game Jam. Needless to say I'm quite happy with the end result!</p>\n<p>My friend, who wasn't participating, came up with the theme for our Game Jam. The theme was: \"The cats  in the whole neighborhood  disappeared , it's your job to  find out why  or/and to bring them back.\"</p>\n<p>We were free to interpret the theme however we want, so long as the essence (the underlined words) of the theme is still there.</p>\n<p>I went with a more Visual Novel-esque approach to the game since it was what I was used to.\u00a0</p><p>I am planning to improve this short game in the future with custom sprites, etc.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c98/c9800f3aa98a645c8849ffff4215b844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kane"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
