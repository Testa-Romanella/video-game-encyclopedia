We have it all, just press \"E\" to change characters, and embark on your adventure!</p>\r\nBackground:\u00a0\r\n<p>I wanted to try my hands at a platformer and I decided to use the same storyline as my previous game (Da Boys). It is a small summer projected created using pre-made assets. I wanted to learn the elements of what went into a platformer, so I began the project.\u00a0It is unpolished, therefore I don't regard it a finished game, however, as I was able to code all the platforming mechanics myself, I am satisfied with it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T16:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da7/da7b9eef18a2adb60a2c713959745e50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Boghossian"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
