You must scavenge for weapons, supplies and find other survivors to join you as you fight your way through a procedurally generated city.\r\n\t\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Current status:</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>The project is on hold indefinitely. Unfortunately I didn't have time for large personal projects for a couple years and now the framework (XNA) is\u00a0outdated. I feel that if I ever do continue development on Through the Dead City, I would start over in Unity and make multiplayer a higher priority. But at the moment there are no plans to continue unless there is a large demand to see it completed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls:</strong> </em></p>\n<ul><li><em><strong>W,A,S,D:</strong> Move </em></li><li><em><strong>Left Click:</strong> Shoot! </em></li><li><em><strong>Right Click:</strong> Melee attack </em></li><li><em><strong>E:</strong> Interact with objects in range of one of your squad members (doors, boxes, cabinets, etc.) </em></li><li><em><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Enter/Exit tactical mode.
