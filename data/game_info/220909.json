There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be.<br/>\u2022 And finally . . . when you reach the winning level, your phone plays a fanfare! Your friends will hate you . . .<br/><br/><br/>Bonus features: counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (no Boons, though), and a very flexible interface for creating your own custom counters for other games.<br/><br/>This app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for Munchkin, Munchkin Quest, or pretty much any other game where you need a counter.<br/><br/>For more information, visit http://www.sjgames.com/apps/levelcounter . . . and for more about Munchkin, visit www.worldofmunchkin.com .<br/><br/>Designed by Steve Jackson / Art by John Kovalic / Original code by J.
