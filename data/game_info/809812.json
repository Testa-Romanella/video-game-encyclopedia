In the course I\u00a0learned about pointers and references, Actor components and Scene components, Header files, Lumen, modular level design, line tracing and collisions, While loops and Arrays, and calling C++ functions from Blueprints. The course covered a lot and I'm\u00a0glad I\u00a0could finish it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some things I\u00a0added to the game\u00a0myself are:</p>\n<p>Footsteps, music, and sound effects. (with reverb for indoors),\u00a0Post processing, Win conditions, on screen control prompts and UI elements, and some extra decorations in the level.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated, so please play and comment what you liked about it or if there's anything I\u00a0could have done better</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c70cc7af6b44246a05be20159d3fe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddPhishGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
