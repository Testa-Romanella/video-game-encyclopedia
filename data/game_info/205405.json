I expect to grow the project and test different ways of search/explore.</p><p>On this projects there are two states, when the user is Editing the terrain and the the user is running the algorithm on it. The camera is fixed but can be changed from orthografic to perspective in any moment<br/></p><p>When the user is Editing the project, he can select different Tiles (multiselection works pressing Alt) and selecting if he wants to have a Wall or Floor. If the user clicks the right-button, the unit will be moved to the Tile selected.<br/></p><p>When te user Runs the application, any time he clicks on one Tile, the unit will try to reach it following the algorithm established. This algoritm can be changed, and the user can decide if he wants to use Diagonal Tiles or not</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96e/96e1a2264471052445fd0c4013886bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dgoldaraz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
