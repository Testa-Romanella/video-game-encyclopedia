{"id": 530383, "slug": "ec", "name": "EC!", "name_original": "EC!", "description": "<p>So this game is about a goblin named Ec!. This little guy has been stalking a scientist hungrily for days now and has finally found where he will be. Navigate down the side of the cliff's face and find the scientist!</p>\n<p>Controls are simple things for simple games:\u00a0</p>\n<p>wasd to move</p>\n<p>mouse to look</p>\n<p>click to attack</p>\n<p>This game is the final for my game design class. I am very proud of how this turned out although I\u00a0wish I had more time. I will definitely be returning to work on this, as it has turned into a pet project for me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's kind of bittersweet, however. While I did receive some assistance from the only team member left in the group in associating the animations of my character, I have done everything else myself and I do wish I had a team that would have helped me realize my vision. I feel like I'm maybe a couple weeks away solo from putting this where I\u00a0want it to be. Cleaning up the animations and adding sound effects, hit boxes//markers, a functioning battle sequence would have pushed this way over the top.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0do want to thank\u00a0 Chris M for finding some time out of class for help. Curtis for getting me started. Valkymaera for making cameras make sense. My goblin Banx(we will have recorded some of his voice work soon). My partner Ashli for taking care of me while sitting at my computer until 7am working on this.\u00a0 Lohany for making Ec! jump and hit.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:30:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a9ca60b9bb1a98c94952eae54fa2ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Carlton.beans"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
