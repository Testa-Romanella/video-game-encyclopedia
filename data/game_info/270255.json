Perhaps I'll add different endings later if I'll receive enough comments on this version.</p>\n<p>A fun fact is that 90% of the development happened from my phone while I\u00a0was in bed keeping company to my napping son.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the story!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fa/7fa367a44121f81e218987eb2c35c18e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["renato_grottesi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
