We have no clue whose bright idea it was to\u00a0route all major systems through the captain's chair, but they did and now we must find a replacement quickly, before anything terrible happens to the lunch room!\r\nReminder to all Tubstronauts:\u00a0\r\nYou are allowed to submit\u00a0only one request per chair\u00a0upgrade. As of this morning\u00a0we've received 68 requests for a\u00a0cheeseburger button and...<strong>\u00a0<em>BING!

You finally have the chance to obtain what you've always dreamed of: a comfy chair with a gyroscope cup holder! Now all you have to do is knock all the other cadets off the holo-platform to collect the most Critical Mass. This should be easy. right?</p>\n<p>Too bad all the other cadets want the captain's chair just as badly as you do. Luckily the science officer has a soft spot for chubby cadets and has offered to give you a few tips and tricks:</p>\n<ul><li>Watch out for the other cadets\u00a0quick dashes and butt slams</li><li>Each time\u00a0someone knocks another cadet out of the arena they will get bigger; making it harder for everyone to navigate within the smaller space</li><li>Any cadet close to critical mass will have a digital hologram marking them</li><li>The Holo-Platform hazards effect the arena and are noted with flashing lights</li><li>Between rounds you can select a modifier that effects every cadets abilities</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Key</strong><strong>Action</strong>WMove ForwardAMove LeftSMove BackDMove RightSPACEDashLEFT CTRLButt Slam\r\n\n<p>Commander PajamaPixie</p>\n<p>Science Officer TheLoneK</p>\n<p>Captain Cliffy</p>\n<p>Weapons Expert Sweff</p>\n<p>Rear Admiral DwunkyPengy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T07:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20fe10bf53fd2f308076013a4773b072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PajamaPixie"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
