Experience a day in the life of an inconveniently positioned rock.</p>\n\n<p>This is a little prototype I put together in under 20 hours (spread over about 8 days of evenings) for\u00a0http://onegameamonth.com/\u00a057 (the theme was Anthropomorphism).</p><p>Version 1.1 was released a month later as an entry for\u00a0http://onegameamonth.com/ 58 (the theme was Freedom). The main new feature was Spine2D based character animation with 3 different character skins to add a bit of variety. Time spent for this iteration was probably a little less than 10 hours - main focused was on how to integrate Spine2D models into Unity, learning how to skin Spine2D models and trying to draw characters that matched the art style of the rest of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89b/89b3a83724e988ff43b197b008689330.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt Van Der Westhuizen"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
