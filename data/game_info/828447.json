Specifically I want more characters, more wacky weapons, and NG+ so you can keep killing stuff with overpowered characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90ea3d9317327a35d1384ec6e3447249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anarch16Sync"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
