Take on the required number of passengers, and throw off as illegal passengers as you can in order to get through all 3 stations, or else, risk slowing down the train. If the Capacity Limit fills up, it's game over, for all of us.\r\n </p>\n<p>You can also lose the game if you get 3 <strong>Warnings</strong> from the Head Conductor by:\r\n </p>\n<ul> <li>Taking too long to handle queues (45s without a decision)/letting one get too long.\r\n </li><li>Capacity Limit is nearly full (80%/40 passengers)\r\n </li><li>Let in 4 illegal passengers in a row, into the train\r\n </li><li>Reject 4 legitimate passengers in a row from entering the train\r\n </li><li>Kick 3 good passengers in a row, out of the train\r\n </li></ul>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p><strong>When the Train is Flying in Space</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move left or right using <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong>. Anyone that has an indicator over their heads is an illegal passenger. Interact with them using <strong>SPACE</strong> to throw them out of the train through the evacuation vent.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>When the Train is at a Space Station</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have two queues of passengers waiting to get on the train. Press <strong>SPACE</strong> to look at the passenger's ticket at the doors, and accept or reject them**.**\r\n </p>\n<p>A legitimate ticket will have:\r\n </p>\n<ul> <li>At the top, an image of a train with \"To Delta\" written on it.\r\n </li><li>\"One Way Ticket\", written right underneath that.\r\n </li><li>It will be \"PAID\" for, so there should be a red stamp.\r\n </li><li>A barcode at the bottom of the ticket.\r\n </li></ul>\n<p>While watching out for those with fake tickets, keep an eye out for anyone who tries to climb into the train!\r\n </p>\n<p>Smash the <strong>SPACE</strong> bar to push the train climbers out!\r\n </p>\n<p>If you happen to come across someone with a Unique Story while checking tickets, you can decide if you want to let them on or not. Don't forget, you can only take on a limited number of passengers per station, or risk slowing down the train and getting engulfed by the black hole that is rapidly getting closer.\r\n </p>\n<p>Depending on your choices, you will get a different ending! Good luck!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c1ff67cd30a5a72635aa3e7567ade2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["smerelo", "Tuile", "LAURENT MIS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
