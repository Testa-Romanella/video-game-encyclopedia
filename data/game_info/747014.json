The gameplay video of my friend shows that LOL</p><p>Hello and welcome to your brand new opened airport, called \"Unreal Airlines\"! Make sure to check everyone's\u00a0passports before letting them onboard, just in case they have a fake passport. Hah! As if that'll ever happen!</p>\n\n<p>Unreal Airlines is a game where you have to check people's passports to see if they're real or not\u00a0 (Which is the theme :p)\u00a0. It's similar to Papers Please, but is more fast-paced and chaotic. Plus, after a few waves, you'll unlock challenges, which you can see by pressing \"W\" on your keyboard. They don't add much, they just make\u00a0a nice little challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb72165c2a46113d8ecafd941e24b33d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GenyaDev"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
