The theme for this year's game jam is, \"Out of Control\".<br/><br/>In this game, the player traverses the level and randomly experiences a variety of\u00a0vocal tics (motor tics were not able to make it in due to time constraint). When NPCs are within range during these tics, they will either turn hostile and chase the player and increase their stress levels (indicated by the top left radial bar) or turn friendly and give the player a speed boost!</p>\n<p>Pick-ups can be found throughout the level and these will help make bridges over pits and destroy boulders on the path.<br/><br/>The game is won if the player makes it to the end of the level without getting too much stress (full bar) or falling/colliding into the pits/boulders. And the game is over, if the player is not lucky enough to make it to the goal.<br/></p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, these features/content were not able to make it in: motor tics, more levels, more vocal tic varieties, non-placeholder art, sounds (music and effects) and particle effects.</p>\n<p>For questions and feedback, reach out to me on Twitter at:\u00a0https://twitter.com/ElRonaldoPablo\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74b9c66edd2be68b719547dd57aab149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElRonaldoPablo"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
