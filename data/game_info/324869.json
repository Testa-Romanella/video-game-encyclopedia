{"id": 324869, "slug": "maddie", "name": "Maddie", "name_original": "Maddie", "description": "<p>Maddie is a tiny candle, set up on an italian restaurant dinner table in the middle of New York City. As the clouds came and the sky got dimmer and dimmer. It suddenly started to rain. Pity on the waiters for not clearing the table and now Maddie has to survive and dodge these rain droplets in order to survive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a snappy quick reaction mini-game with minimal controls and a cartoon-ish vibe.</p>\n<p>Play time: Between 1 - 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>Maddie is under the name of <strong>Pinnical Studio</strong>. An independent collaboration between <strong>Andrei Zi Zhen Cretu</strong> and <strong>Giacomo Autili</strong> with the support from <strong>Sebastian Zamfirescu\u00a0</strong>who provided all the Sound FX and Music Assets.</p>\n\n<p><em>Let's stay in touch!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Andrei Zi Zhen Cretu</strong> - Twitter/Instagram</p>\n<p><strong>Giacomo Autili</strong> - Behance/ Instagram</p>\n<p><strong>Sebastian Zamfirescu</strong> - Mixcloud</p>\n<p><strong>Pinnical Studio </strong>- Facebook/Twitter/Instagram</p>\n<p>We have a Discord too!</p>\n<p>Post your score in the comments down below! :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>:</p>\n<p>As this has been our very first game where\u00a0we had almost no knowledge of Unity/C#, Game Design and Game Development. I would like to thank Blackthornprod for their Udemy Course and Jonas Tyroller's youtube video on how to make a game interesting through meaningful design and play.\u00a0(video here) I would also like to thank the Indie Game Dev communities on various discord channels for helping us and giving insights throughout the process. (Special thanks: Rebecca Perrone,\u00a0KrakenGames, DevilDerp)</p><p><strong>Notice</strong>: The game still has an issue when it is put on full screen. That is because during the development, it was never planned to implement a full screen feature but WebGL provides one regardless of the game. If you encounter any problem please write it in the comment section down below and I will try my best to fix the game! Thank you\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T05:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/194/1949c98059e79c0d8a6a9bc82eb5267b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrei Zi Zhen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
