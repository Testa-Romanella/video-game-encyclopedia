Darn!).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Got this done within the 9 hours. Version 2 took longer than I wanted, so Version 3 is incomplete. I tried to work in all three themes too, but again - 9 hours is not much time and I'm happy I made it as far as I\u00a0did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking forward to checking out all the other entries.
