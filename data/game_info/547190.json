The idea behind the game was to get a cup of coffee so you don't fall asleep, and u get chased by ghosts. To get the coffee you need to assemble the coffee machine. Fighting ghost is only by turning the light on. I might get back to this project and finish it. All pixel art is drawn by me.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - moving,<br/></p>\n<p>E - action key<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:33:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/09237732d5f5e539dea1962f9a6fee98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HumanBones"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
