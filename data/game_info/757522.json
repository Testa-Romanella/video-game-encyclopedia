Your 'doctor' gives you orders and you have to cooperate to push story forward. While you are doing exercises something happens.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>When you hear some growling on either side, shoot in that direction. One bullet is enough to kill. Thing might hiss for one or two seconds after getting hit, so try to hear pass that - maybe there is another behind him. Save your bullets - you have limited amount. Try to have fun!</p>\n<ul>Controls:\r\n<li>Left arrow key - to shoot left</li>\n<li>Right arrow key - to shoot right</li>\n<li>Space - to start while on main menu</li>\n<li>Escape - exit game</li>\n</ul>\n\r\nAdditional info\r\n<p>I have created in game dialog system, with options for player to answer yes/no. However due to lack of skill in story making, I cut it out of the current version of the game.
