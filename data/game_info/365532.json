While grabbing an object, Right Mouse Button to throw it. You can only throw two things. A sohl and a friend.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-------------- DEEP HIDDEN L0RE----------------------</p>\n<p>In the galaxy Messier 82,\u00a0 planet Makeit is having trouble. You are space civilian, Kownt, who's traveling around the empty void trying to save Sohls. To do so, Kownt must take the Sohls to the Well of Spicy Hot where they will be forever saved\u00a0. When all has been\u00a0collected in Kownt's current area, the Well will rip open another dimension where you will travel to your next, and possibly last,\u00a0destination. But fear not, you have friends. Friends to help reach where you can't reach, climb where you can't climb, and save what must be saved. Go, Kownt, they're counting on you! Only you can do it. All your actions, you must make it...count.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n<p>SoundFX and Ambience by :\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/jalastram</p>\n<p>Models were from starter content. I just reshaped them(longer/ shorter/ fatter skinnier).</p>\n<p>Things not to do unless you want be/get bugged out:\u00a0Hold the box when you are on top of it. Hold the Sohl or box when looking straight up.</p>\n\n<p>I did the C++/Blueprint programming of game mechanics and such, game design, shader things, the sparkly style whatever thing I\u00a0did by accident, level design and something else I don't remember. I've never done anything Blueprint prior to this, and once I started it, I think it is pretty cool! I only started seriously learning UE4 two weeks ago, so I think I did A LOT of things wrong. But that's just it goes in the beginning! I think my Unity knowledge finally connected the dots and carried me through. One thing if you play, that the all levels are mirrored from left and right. I liked the idea of some symmetry, so I did that. I think it is kind of cool, and it makes it easier for me to design levels because I AM REALLY BAD AT IT...along with making games, programming and everything else in life. Number of Solhs required\u00a0 to be collect is\u00a0 also the level number.</p>\n\n<p>This was made during the UE4 summer jam of 2019 and finished during the time given. But due to my greediness, it was uploaded 3 minutes too late and was not submitted. Upload speeds to itch.io were not on my side and watching that progress bar during the last 10 minutes was the longest 10 minutes of my life.\u00a0Many emotions, such sadness. I will probably try to recreate those moments\u00a0into a game one day. Just thinking about it makes me chuckle if I was watching myself. Good times!</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know how much you liked it or hated it. Any kind feedback is welcome! I am THICC skinned. I can take the punches!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:35:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9d302e1e79c36d5e7a7c265f7d612c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["drw"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
