Notice the fullscreen  button at the bottom-right corner of the game area on some devices.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Dwellings is an adaptation, in the Game Boy format, of my conceptual album of the same name.  The game acts as promotional material for the album while slightly  expanding on its lore and bringing some elements into a different form  of life. Most of the text content in the game comes from the album  lyrics, which serve as clues to help you advance. The original music and full lyrics can be found on the link above. Both works  are intended to complement each other to provide a cross-format  experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T08:01:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d63cab347de8b14e32c13df4ec2f8b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Greenwich"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
