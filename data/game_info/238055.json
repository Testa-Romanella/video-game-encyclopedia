{"id": 238055, "slug": "jump-kid", "name": "Jump Kid", "name_original": "Jump Kid", "description": "Grassy fields, wintery lands, to even molten lava biomes, you must, and I mean MUST reach the top of the mountain by any means necessary. Jump Kid made a deal with a magical fairy, that if he made it to the top of the mountain she'd grant him any selfish wish he wants. But there's a twist: Jump Kid can only make it up to the top by only jumping (Thus the name). Good thing you never missed leg day. <br/><br/><br/>Jump Kid is a solo indie project made entirely from one person. (Me!) Divinal is my own founded company, and is currently in a small stage of what is to come! I will continue to work and develop Jump Kid until it is a fully released game with everything a 3D platformer could want! Steam achievements, cards, etc. More and more info will be released such as the new biomes you will come across in the Jump Kid universe. Be sure to check out the social media links on the Steam page for more info!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef2/ef2afa79ef5d747f8aca2a48b8fd8c2c.jpg", "website": "http://thasmobi.com/jumpkid", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tommy Hass", "Divinal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tommy Hass", "Divinal"], "esrb_rating": null}
