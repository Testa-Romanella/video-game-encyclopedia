This way you can see if you made a mistake because the flower won't be ticked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>EXPERT</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> You have less time for everything.</li>\n<li>There is no guide colour in Petal Moves and Petal Swap. </li>\n<li> Flowers are not ticked when they are correct.</li>\n<li> If all the flowers are correct the level will end.</li>\n<li> Therefore if the level doesn't end it is up to you to determine where the mistake is and fix it (or restart).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Petal Puzzler Game Demo from Evolutionary Games on Vimeo.</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game was tested and working in Windows 10.  This game was also tested and working on a Windows XP 1.73GHZ and 504mb ram computer with a square screen.  It will fill the screen but be slightly stretched. <br/></p>\n<p>The game is written in the resolution 1920 x 1080.<br/></p>\n<p> It was tested on Windows 10 and also on a ratio of 1366 x 768 - it fills the screen correctly.</p>\n<p>The game is set to stretch to fit your monitor - there won't be a significant difference playing this game in window or full screen mode. You may have to exit and re-run the game after switching to window mode for it to trigger on Windows XP.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.0.1</strong></p>\n<p>Solved an issue to the pause screen that would sometimes create a black screen while waiting for the player to press any key to continue.</p>\n<p>Renamed the save files to give them more unique names as it had the potential to create a conflict with other games. <em><strong>Warning</strong></em> - this does mean that if you update to this version you will lose your progress.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e236ad00d3a84bce03b69cd0711f5e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evolutionary Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
