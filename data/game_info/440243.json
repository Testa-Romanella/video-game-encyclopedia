Valuable stones and gems line the walls and fill the earth above and below. For any other slime creature,\u00a0the Glittering\u00a0Cave would make a nice place to settle down and live a mostly sedentary life. This particular slime, however, is more driven to explore the cave.</p>\n<p>It does not remember where it goes. It does not remember why it goes. All the slime knows is that it must keep going.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:<br/></strong>Arrow Keys: Move<br/>Space: Jump<br/>Repeatedly Press Space near Object: Wall-jump</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Lead Direction: Christopher Saenz<br/>Game Mechanics: Michael Baker<br/>Design: Michael Baker,\u00a0Christopher Saenz<br/>Programming: Michael Baker, Christopher Saenz<br/>Level 0 Music: Battle Trooper by Makai\u00a0Symphony (https://soundcloud.com/makai-symphony)<br/>All other art and music assets made by Christopher Saenz<br/><br/>This game\u00a0should never be monetized or sold for profit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9ffcd344b6423b47cdbe26eed1da888e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher Saenz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
