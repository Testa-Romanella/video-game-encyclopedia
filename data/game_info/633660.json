You can download the\u00a0<strong>Fen_the_fox.exe and play the game. Sadly, the right icon isn't set to it due to some godot problems. If you download\u00a0Fen_the_fox.7z, extract and\u00a0</strong>run the .exe with the .pck in the same directory. This file has the right custon icon. I'll upload the icon.ico since you can always make a shortcut and set a custon icon for the standalone executable. For any choosen file, the game will work fine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26a/26a6846ec67b2213e2d3a199fb28ed25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KeichiTS", "jaspior", "joaoppar"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
