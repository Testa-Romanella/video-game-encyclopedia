The main character is a castaway. While travelling on his raft on an island complex, he crashed on the shallows. Washed up on another island with a broken raft and nowhere else to go, he needs to find the necessary components to repair it: wood, rope and rags. His time is running out, as he will die of starvation if he doesn't leave immediately. Can he make it out?<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer, Team Lead: Aimilios Seimenis<br/>Environment &amp; Level Design: Nikolas Joukowski<br/>Producer, Game Design: Dimitris Lourantos<br/>Art: Giorgos Karageorgas, Nikos Tziotis<br/>Music &amp; Sound Design: Sevina Ilieva, Ilias Tsismalidis\r\n</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Odysseas &amp; Lito for the Skeleton model\r\n</p>\n<p>External Assets used are listed in the GitHub repo below.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T13:37:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e534c8e9778bc6eea0e161405baf0ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikolas Joukowski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
