The game is very short, play it to the end to get the truth.<br/></p>\n<p>So it seems like time got in my way and I could not even finish the story. The main idea was that 'Happy' had to collect things that made him happy, but he was actually depressed and at the end of the game the only thing the game would let you do was suicide. Didn't really have time to implement any of that, not even 1 level. But at least I did something and here it is.
