I\u00a0set up an alternative link on my own website, so you can play it online (it's mobile friendly, too!). I\u00a0also tried embedding the game right into this description page with a frame, but that does not work either.<br/></p>\n<p>Getting the file count to fall within\u00a0ITCH.IO's accepted margin will require reworking the entire game. This is an old project from many years ago, and I\u00a0don't want to put more time into it at the moment. Therefore I\u00a0decided to just host it externally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can download the zip file. Double-clicking \"index.html\" will start the game in your browser.</p>\n<em>Why did you build this like a monkey with a wrench?</em>\n<p>This is a very old project. I\u00a0really used the most basic tools to create this:\u00a0Photoshop and HTML.\u00a0I found it on some old backup drive, blew the dust away,\u00a0and despite the poor technical aspects of this thing, I\u00a0still thought the humor was holding up. I had some fun with it. So I cleared out some bugs and\u00a0decided to share it with the world because there's still a nice experience somewhere in there.</p>\n<p>Truth is, \u00a0it won't matter to most people how this was actually made. It works, so\u00a0hopefully you can have some fun playing it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<em>How can I\u00a0access the grayed-out options?</em>\n<p>Grayed-out options are not playable at the moment.\u00a0Sorry! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d5b0599f60d402f1ba365724a252fe3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rafael"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
