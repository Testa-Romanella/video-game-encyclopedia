She's a laid back gal when she's not ruling over her universe named:\r\nThe Spektrum\r\nOther than that, she'd make a great person for you to make friends with! (or maybe more???)\r\n<p>*Please continue below to read more as described by KERV herself!</p>\n<br/>\n<p>You can choose to date or be-friend the Kreator!\u00a0Ultimately, it is for you to decide where you'd like to go with her relationship-wise.</p>\n<p>This game is short as it was a little test. I'm learning how to use Ren'py and I'm trying to make a steady and\u00a0gradual effort into the indie developing world. So, in short, this is the first game I've ever made and published! (That's also If you don't count the mini ones I\u00a0made on my TI-84 calculators-)</p>\n\n<ul><li>Chance to date the Kreator,\u00a0<em>and in her date fit too!\u00a0</em></li><li>Have the chance to gain a best friend!\u00a0</li><li>Have the chance to have a cool new fictional gf!!! (???)\u00a0</li><li>10 minutes of gameplay (give or take)\u00a0</li><li>An exciting chance to find out what else could be in store in the future!!!!!</li></ul>\n\r\n\r\nInstead of a FAQ, it's an ATPQ aka Answer To Possible Questions! Clever right?\r\n\n<p><strong>Q: How can I\u00a0play the game?</strong></p>\n<p>A:\u00a0This game can only be played on a browser at the moment! I'm still testing out a lot of things, and I\u00a0need to make sure that I\u00a0learn how to do everything the right way :')</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long did it take you to make this game?</strong></p>\n<p>A: I'm not even going to lie to you right now... Under 24 hours, and that's even including the time I took to make little tweaks here and there. Again, <em><strong>this game was made to help me learn the basics so I can gradually get myself ready for a big project</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Who's \"the Kreator\"?</strong></p>\n<p>A: She is basically, in lament terms,\u00a0the head honcho of the universe in which my characters reside. There's more to come about her and other characters, maybe not in this game, but maybe that'll be a project for me in the future :)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can get to know some of the other important figures in the Spektrum Universe here.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Q:\u00a0Who made the art and the sprites?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A: I\u00a0did! Before nerding out and trying to involve myself in coding a visual novel\u00a0world, I've been consistently and proudly making art for six years! You can find more of my art here!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where is the music from? Who made it?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A: I\u00a0was thankful enough to find and have the ability to use music from oo39.com! It's a small company located in Hokkaido, Japan, and they make music for people to use in their games, commercials, etc. I recommend you check out their work, and for those who want to know the specific tracks for certain parts of the game, they're tracks ys157, ys126, and ys176!</p>\n\r\nHope you enjoy what you see and stay for what is to come!\r\n\r\nif you'd like to follow along with KERV's art, dev, and life journey click the photo!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T08:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b0d2c7b83e88ce69f25965e5b93f8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KERV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
