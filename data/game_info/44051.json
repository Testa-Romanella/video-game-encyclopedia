All resources can be earned fairly in game. No additional payment necessary. \"ELITE Sponsorship\" is the only additional digital package you can purchase outside of the game itself. \"ELITE Sponsorship\" is a one time digital purchase and lasts for as long as you have your game account. Because it is a one time purchase, it can NOT be stacked by purchasing it again. <br/><br/>\"ELITE Sponsorship\" grants a bonus of \"Meta Crystals\" to start off with and a great increase in \"Meta Crystals\" earned at the beginning of every month. It also grants some cosmetic perks like achievement avatars, elite sponsorship chat background etc. Sponsorship is not needed to progress in the game but it helps to fund our efforts, helps fund our free updates and expansions, and it helps keep the game a \"one time payment\" model. We believe in the one time \"pay and play for ever\" business model and we hope to have your support so we can keep our games that way for always.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b6b178047bde057197d581ace3bb879.jpg", "website": "http://hatefreeheroes.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 35}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starlight Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["U Game Me"], "esrb_rating": null}
