Zombie Hunters 2 continues the series&#39;s hack and slash style of gameplay in the vein of Capcom&#39;s Devil May Cry or Koei&#39;s Dynasty Warriors games. This time, Aya is joined by her sister, Saki, and the mysterious Reiko as they must find the cause of a second Zombie outbreak. Retaining the &quot;Cool Combo&quot; system and the Rage and Blood meters found in the first game, The Oneechanbara 2 added some character specific moves, such as Aya&#39;s throwing knives, as well as smarter enemies, and new way&#39;s to defeat enemies.  It also introduced a tag system to the series, allowing the player to select two characters and switch between them at anytime.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T02:21:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9ac/9acdc62673bc9cce774dd704731b549f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Tamsoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
