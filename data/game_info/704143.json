It just started as a small concept for a\u00a0school project, but I liked it enough to start developing it more.</p>\n<p>I plan to use a lot of puzzling and discovery of things in this game. As of now, I don't plan on implementing any sort of combat in this game. This is just a world to explore, solve puzzles and discover cool things (creatures, plants, locations, etc.)</p>\n<p>This is my first time making a game like this so it will probably take a lot of learning to make something good but I appreciate as much feedback as possible both good and bad :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71e9be69e8ed299d01ecfd9bcf3a496a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlinkyTheHackerMan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
