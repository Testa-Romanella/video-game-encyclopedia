In this game, you start with an empty zoo with only one goal in mind: to become a Zoo Boss!</p>\n<p>You can purchase animals to populate your pens, or choose a more unorthodox route of becoming an attraction site with restaurants and rides. It's really up to you to decide how you choose to rule your zoo!</p>\n<p>You can also choose to play with other Zoo Bosses, too. Host your own server for others to join, or join someone else's server to help manage their zoo. It's really up to you.</p>\n<p>Team Roles:</p>\n<p>Jessie Archer - Programmer, Game Designer</p>\n<p>Brandon Lo - Programmer, Game Designer</p>\n<p>Noel Machuca Paredes - Game\u00a0Designer, UI/UX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T17:04:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e110282208f576c935881d1551759b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["BTLSandwich", "CelestialFlair", "GoozmaBackAtItAgain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
