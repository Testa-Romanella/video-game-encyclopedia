The theme was<br/></p>\n<p>'voice' and I wanted to make a game where you had to record your voice and then\r\n</p>\n<p>make music using that voice. I had trouble getting the recording part to work so I\r\n</p>\n<p>decided to just use premade assets/sound effects. I had a lot of fun developing it\r\n</p>\n<p>and I learned a lot about developing around BPM/the precision that is required.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<strong>--</strong></strong>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Click on the note symbol on the left to pick a sound.
