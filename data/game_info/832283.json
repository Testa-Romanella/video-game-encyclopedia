{"id": 832283, "slug": "camptown-racers", "name": "Camptown Racers", "name_original": "Camptown Racers", "description": "<p>This game was made in 9 days for Lone Rabbit's Multiplayer Jam. In this game, you are placed on a huge island where players can create race challenges for other players to complete.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>The point of the game is to as many apples (pts) as you can. You can get apples by completing other player's races or when players fail to complete a race you created. Do you trust your own skills enough to potentially lose more pts if you fail?</p>\n<p>Mouse - Navigate menus, Control camera</p>\n<p>WASD - Move around</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint while on land, swim fast while in water</p>\n<p>Space - Jump while on land, rise while treading water</p>\n<p>Ctrl - Descend while treading water</p>\n<p>E - Start racing nearby ghost</p>\n<p>F - Start placing your own race</p>\n<p>Right click - Zoom in</p>\n<p>Esc/Tab - Open menu</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong>\n</p>\n<p>- If you attempt to place an apple, but click \"never mind\" at the end, the ghosts around the island won't spawn back in until you place another apple and override a saved race. To fix this, just reload the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>- There's currently no way to restart or give up on a race before the timer expires. You kinda just have to wait until the time is up to try again or give up. This is potentially an issue because if you're stuck in a race you can't complete with a long timer, you're kinda stuck. Just reload the game at that point.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, game design, level design - Vykri</p>\n<p>Sound / Music, cover image - Audio Withdrawal</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Environment assets - Kenney\u00a0[CC0]</p>\n<p>Impact Player Controller\u00a0(modified) - Feverdream Johnny / John Ellis\u00a0[GPL]</p>\n<p>Low-poly Fox (modified) - Ida Faber\u00a0[CC BY]<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d286eae7ea225d8ac522111fe3cd38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Vykri"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
