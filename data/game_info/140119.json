Controls are [Space] and [Enter] (so two buttons ;) ). Eat the smaller green fishes, and avoid the larger red fishes, at least until you've outgrown them! <br/> <br/> <br/>Please post high-scores! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>======== <br/>PERSONAL <br/>======== <br/> <br/>This was made for Ludum Dare 34 in by 1 person from scratch in less than 48 hours. Between my grandmother's 90st birthday and organizing a babyshower for men I'm glad to say I've managed to still squeeze something out this time. And it came out surprisingly fun. <br/> <br/>My focus was on fun and theme: both growing and two button control inspired me to combine some known mechanics into something new. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305172c7b8e349b28cd0164358a03c56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jer.re"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
