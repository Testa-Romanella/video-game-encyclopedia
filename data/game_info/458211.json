The thing about it is that things are not really specific.

I probably had enough time left\u00a0 but i suddenly just wasn't in the mood to proceed.</p>\n<p>This means planned features are not in the game like:</p>\n<p>- Mailman, for some tasks you would need to wait for the Mailman and you would be able to talk to him. By talking with him you would make him like you or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which would make him come faster to help you with some of the planned tasks.</p>\n<p>- Seeing Employes walk around. It was planned seeing employes walk around.</p>\n<p>- Much more Machines.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:52:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b7/3b746b0040d4c86766f5442709590b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
