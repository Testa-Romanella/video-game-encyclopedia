The theme was <strong><em>Roll of the Dice</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>To play, you can move the white dice\u00a0 by rolling\u00a0with <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>WASD</strong>. The goal of the game is to defeat all the enemy dice by following the restriction shown above and being on the next tile of a dice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has a randomness aspect to it, but you can predict movement using <strong>Spacebar</strong> to see the different hidden faces of each dice. You can switch between prediction mode and dissasembly mode for the view of the dice with\u00a0<strong>Z</strong> /\u00a0<strong>M</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is 6 levels with increasing difficulty.
