Tell you what though, that dream can now become reality, in virtual reality! Combat Tested gives you the ability to use telekinesis, but you\u2019ve also got some kick-ass swords you can use to cut through almost anything. The cool thing about these swords is that they slice through obstacles in real time, meaning that you can cut objects any way you want.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee54808fdbaf72bf6a2badb9f997de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Buckethead Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
