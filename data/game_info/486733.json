With her three robotic machines known as corebot companions, Joule ventures throughout Far Eden to uncover the secrets behind the failed mission. The open world of Far Eden is subject to exploration and the collection of resources. Joule&#39;s weapons are color-coded to inflict damage on a particular set of enemies and, like her companions, can also be enhanced. The corebots support her in battle and puzzle solving.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T20:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d76/d76bd51161884d729ceac7e98eacde80.jpg", "website": "https://www.recoregame.com/", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 1388, "beaten": 33, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 80, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 121, "suggestions_count": 680, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 122, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Armature Studio", "Comcept"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
