Find out if you qualify for integration courses! Or maybe you're already integrated! Just don't piss off the bureaucrat otherwise you'll have your benefits revoked. And don't ask to learn Swedish, Finland's other national language.</p><p>EU Migrants, students, refugees, asylum seekers and those coming to Finland to join their partners all experience the integration process to some degree. Few receive support, some don't. This game is not a 100% accurate depiction of the process or the factors determining who gets to take an integration course, merely a demonstration of what immigrants experience.</p><p>This game was created for 1-bit Clicker Jam by an actual immigrant, in Finland. </p><p>For more information about what it's like to integrate in Finland check out the podcast I produced for Kommunf\u00f6rbundet on SoundCloud.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/5697d4632e0e46134ea7e8e8a38fdabf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OneGameDad"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
