Whilst repairing an antenna off-base you receive a garbled distress call from back at base. Something about utility robots going haywire and taking the colonists hostage. You rush back to the airlock to investigate...</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at each base level, your priority should be to restore power to that level and find the airlock key to exit via the second airlock. Make use of everything you find along the way and disable hostile robots you encounter - or find a way to sneak past. The game is mouse controlled.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for UDGJ #2<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Contact<br/></strong>email: onesevenonegames@gmail.com<br/>Twitter: twitter.com/BenJames171\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cab/cab0c65385fab0416b64dd9562f3ab5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["benjames171"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
