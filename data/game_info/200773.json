The game is about Bob Ross escaping from the danger below by painting tetris-like blocks to navigate on.</p>\n<p>The main focus of this assignment were to have a niche idea\u00a0\u00a0and it resulted in us creating a game that could be played on a DS/3DS, though obviously we couldn't do that so we faked it. Also included in the assignment were to research user-base, marketing, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>You play the game by moving either left or right with the character\u00a0and holding LMB to draw on the grid-panel at the bottom. When you have drawn/painted a working pattern (think tetris) then press F to place. There is currently no win condition.</p>\n<p>A and D - Moving<br/>Space -\u00a0Jump / Use (in menu)<br/>Place block - F<br/>Draw/Paint - Hold LMB\u00a0(Left Mouse Button)</p>\n<p><strong>Other info</strong></p>\n<p>Engine: Game Maker Studio<br/>Duration: 2 weeks<br/>Members: 5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8a9d89025f548bff896fe86c27bf215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zahhibb"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
