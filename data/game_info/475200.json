However, I did use C64 colors for the game just to get the same feel.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>PGUp/PgDown to scale the screen (starts in 64/64 due to the jam)</p>\n<p>1-0 Keys to fast zoom. Recommend 5 for most screens<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move. You can move crates/barrels/chests. Avoid fire.</p>\n<p>Obstacles can't be moved.<br/></p>\n<p>Move objects to the dirt path to get a score. Move yourself there to GTFO and generate a new map.<br/></p>\n<p>You can use objects to snuff out fires.</p>\n<p>The fire spreads so balance loot with getting out fast!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/9128a52358a6959df4a4d095aabea7c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["4KbShort"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
