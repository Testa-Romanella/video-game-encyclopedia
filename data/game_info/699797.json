The free version comes with the LiteNetLib provider, while users of FigNet Paid will be able to use ENet, TCP, and WebSocket providers as well.\r\n</p>\r\nFAQ:\r\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>\u00a0Does FigNet provides load-balancing?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0No, FigNet is a networking solution that facilitates session management, messaging (server-server, client-server), logging and serialization. For server-management features like load-balancing, AWS GameLift, or equivalent technology are recommended.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong>\u00a0Does FigNet provides Room Management and High-level features like State Replication.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong>\u00a0No, FigNet does not provide high-level features like room management and state replication. It is intended to be a low-level, efficient framework.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q:\u00a0</strong>What platforms does FigNet support?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A:\u00a0</strong>FigNet is corss-pltform. It is written in .NET Core and has been tested on all desktop and mobile platforms, in addition to WebGL. The Unity package is written in .NET 4x.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: What options do I have for the server app?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: You can use the Unity executable or a .NET Core app as the server (both console/headless and graphical builds are supported).</p>\r\nDocumentation\r\n<p>Documentation\r\n</p>\r\nDiscord\r\n<p>Join us on\u00a0Discord\u00a0for queries\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\u00a0<br/>Logo:\u00a0www.pngaaa.com/detail/561372<br/>Client side app is build on top of this repo\u00a0https://github.com/JasperDre/Agar<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T07:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b21/b21c183d9f018c888256be669003025c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmed310"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
