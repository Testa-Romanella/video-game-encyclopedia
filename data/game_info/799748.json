So I made a space station level and added spider enemies that you have to kill in order to complete the game. <br/></p>\n<p>I didnt manage to finish my game due to that the AI decided to bug out 5 hours before submission. Thats why it is so incomplete, but its <em>playable </em>and you got stuff to do in the level. I will complete the game after the gamejam ends. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Press 1,2,3 to spawn guns</p>\n<p><strong>Left mouse button</strong>: Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Right mouse button</strong>: Aim</p>\n<p><strong>Q/E</strong>: Lean left or right</p>\n<p><strong>Left shift</strong>: Sprint</p>\n<p><strong>Left ctrl</strong>: Crouch <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>Spiders can see through wall <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T08:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172bfc9d8aab57098a7b435fd0dbbdfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimTech"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
