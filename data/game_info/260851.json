It was\u00a0<strong>ME!</strong> (and Maddie(but mostly me))</p>\n<p>Since then, it's been our mission to bring you the most in-depth, in-teresting, and in-credible paranormal videos on the web! And what better way to celebrate the supernatural than an extra special Halloween livestream? It is the very best day of the year, after all.</p>\n<p>So kick back, relax, and enjoy as me and Maddie celebrate this most wonderful of days with an awesome treat for all of you. I'm sure you're all\u00a0<em>dying\u00a0</em>to see more of me, after all. Get it? Dying? I'm so funny.</p>\n<p>(<em>Hey, Maddie here. This game is a bonus episode that serves as a questionably canon prequel to Heart of the Woods. We hope you enjoy it, despite Tara's best efforts to make it sound as unappealing as possible. Happy Halloween!</em>)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/ede9b7b7a579495de858d789c7bdb669.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Studio \u00c9lan", "minute", "Adirosa", "cybirdpunk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
