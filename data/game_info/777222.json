You arrive at the infection\r\nzone and say to yourself \u201cIt's time to take the cap off the bug\r\nspray\u201d. Then take out your pistol, twirl it and chuckle to\r\nyourself.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bug Deather 19XX</strong> is inspired by the\r\noriginal Doom and a bunch of Doom wads (mods) and the original Thief.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It's not as fast-paced and arcade-y like Doom. It has some stealth mechanics. It's a amalgam of sorts, it might work or it might not? But! It just might. (It will!)<br/></p>\n<p>A lot of work was put into the enemies, you can shoot off arms, legs, wings, gun-arms and they will act differently. If you shoot off a leg they will hop, if you shoot off their gun they will smack you. So play around with them or just shoot them, whatever<br/></p>\r\nMEET THE BUGS\r\n\n<p><strong>Renegade Claw</strong></p>\n<p>The foot soldier equipped with a lazer\r\ncannon and a melee attack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Killbug</strong></p>\n<p>An armored bug that will shoot globs of\r\nacid at you.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Boombee</strong></p>\n<p>A giant wasp that will sting, also\r\nit will self destruct. It's basically a nicer version of irl wasps.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>????:</strong></p>\n<p>there is no boss monster!</p>\n<p>there is maybe a boss monster?????\u00bf</p>\r\nYOUR WEAPONS\r\n<p><strong>The Last Resort</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It sounds cool but it's actually the\r\nweakest weapon and should be your last resort. It does have unlimited\r\nammo and a melee attack though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nail Blaster</strong></p>\n<p>It's basically a shotgun, but it\r\nbehaves in a video game way where the closer you are the more damage\r\nit will do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sphere Rifle</strong><br/></p>\n<p>its a machine gun</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gold-Eye Sniper</strong></p>\n<p>Cliche sniper rifle that takes out most\r\nenemies in one shot. (The scope does not zoom in, the whole screen\r\ndoes.)</p>\r\nITEMS:\r\n\n<p><strong>Health Point</strong></p>\n<p>+2 Health<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Health Pack</strong></p>\n<p>+25 Health<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Coin</strong></p>\n<p>It's a fun collectable but it does nothing. It was originally intended to do something but that is a mystery now.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Speed Up</strong></p>\n<p>Increases your speed for a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Card</strong></p>\n<p>Open key color doors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Egg</strong></p>\n<p>Some of them may explode while others do nothing.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>+ Many More!</strong><br/></em></p>\n<p>Like Doom, there are<strong> a lot</strong> of secrets\r\nto find. Each level has a timer and a score for items found, kills\r\nand secrets discovered. </p>\n<p>(There is a mega-secret on level 1, it's very hard to discover and isn't counted as a secret on the end stage screen though.)</p>\n<p>Most of the music was made in Bosca Coeil.</p>\n<p>This game has a frame rate cap because the CPU tends to freak the f out when it's unlimited cap. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong> WASD or Arrow Keys</li><li><strong>Look</strong>: Mouse</li><li><strong>Fire Weapon</strong>: Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Secondary Weapon Effect</strong>: Right Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Spacebar</li><li><strong>Activate/Open Doors</strong>: E</li><li><strong>Pause</strong>: Esc or Tab</li><li><strong>Select Weapon:</strong> 1 2 3 and 4</li><li><strong>Reload</strong>: R</li></ul>\n<p>If you liked this game follow these:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also check out Rushwood Forest Tale.</p>\n<p>Next game is a mystery, it might be a <em>stealthy </em>sequel to Roly Poly, who could say?</p>\n<p>Also no making fun of how the monsters look, they look completely threatening and not like they were designed by a 4th grader.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T12:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce9/ce9cfa7ad6dbae58686344d6fce15441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Echomune"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
