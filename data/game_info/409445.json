I planned to make a game about the theme of<strong> 'Justice' </strong>a few hours before the deadline. The creative idea took about half an hour, and then the program implementation took About 2 hours or so,\u00a0 finally I missed the submission time.\u00a0\u00a0When I stepped out of the door, a greater loss came,\u00a0 I learned that Kobe Bryant was gone.\u00a0\u00a0So, I spent a few more days polishing this game into a game commemorating Kobe Bryant.</p>\n<p>I know the NBA because of Yao Ming. Kobe Bryant was a hero of that era, and that was my youth. His spirit has always inspired us to move forward, and he tells us to stay firm and persistent in life.<br/></p>\n<p>May Kobe Bryant and Gigi and all those who lost their lives in this air crash rest in peace.</p>\n<p>May everyone live in the moment and cherish those around them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f7bb93fab2099e64f886dc15999ca6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zhong317"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
