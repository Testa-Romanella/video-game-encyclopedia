But when the welkin wanderer, Moontoot Macleod, learns of the ousted celestial's plight, she sallies forth on her spectrum ride with her Rainbow Sword raised to the heavens, ready to rain down justice and reflect retribution.</p>\n<p>Rainbow Sword was designed for the A Game By Its Cover (AGBIC) competition. The premise of the competition was to design a game based upon a previously existing fictitious game cartridge. Rainbow Sword was based upon Rainbow Sword. </p>\n<p>Rainbow Sword is a fast-paced hybrid of a Beat 'em up and Shoot 'em up set in a Zelda-esque dungeon in the sky. This double-rainbow gaming gestalt finds the rainbow connection with Kevin Carville's ephemeral effects and Chris Manthey's funky beats\u2014elevating Rainbow Sword to an unparalleled empyrean experience.
