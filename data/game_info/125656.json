Our Game In Clover </em>is about giving the player a sense of comfort and ease of mind. Designed to be a happy stress free game where the player creates their own version of home with the level they play in. There is a heavy contrast between a dark and rainy outside and the warm cosy inside that can be explored and interacted with. Changing the environment to better suit your ideal comfort, making sure the sound is just right and finally stepping away and just listening and observing to what makes you at ease. From something as little as sitting around a computer screen to clicking sounds, to making a hot chocolate and sitting in front of a fireplace with the distant sound of muffled rain, it's all about what makes you feel <em>In Clover.</em></p><p>Credits</p><p>Ismail Ghadban - Designer/Project Manager</p><p>Matt Davies - Level Designer/External Talent Liaison</p><p>Jack Pettit - Programmer</p><p>Jori Wright - Programmer</p><p>Lachy Gleeson - Audio</p><p>Mitchell Roberts - Animator</p><p>Isabelle Britton - Animator</p><p>Cate Garrett - Animator</p><p>Chloe Cuddihy - Graphic Designer<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faaf8da7fa03b42314cf03642239a51b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ighadban", "MatthewDavies", "Insaniac", "JackSAE"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
