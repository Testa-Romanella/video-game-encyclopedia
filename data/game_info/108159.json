You know the one.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Samurai Bun</em> was a 2015 collab between \r\n\t@monkeyotoshi and myself, but it never really went anywhere. I experimented a bit with freeze frames and weird effects, but the mechanic just isn't satisfying enough and I suspect it would work a lot better if the projectile would move in two dimensions. But at that point we'd have basically reinvented pong, and that's where we kind of abandoned this project, I think.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\n\tPress \r\n\t<strong>A</strong> for the left guy, <strong>B</strong> for the guy on the right.
