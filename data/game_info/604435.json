Move current word (red) with A, D, S, W and place it on existing words (black). Placing a word on two matching words will remove the current word and the matching words. If two matching words are connected by a fourth word also this will be removed. The score for a correct match is the sum of the letter score of the current word = word score (same as in Scrabble). You get points for placing (word score) and removing words (word score times 4). Skipping a word will reduce your score by word score.</p>\n<p><strong>Move word: </strong>A, D, S, W</p>\n<p><strong>Enter word</strong>: RETURN / ENTER <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rotate word</strong>: R</p>\n<p><strong>Skip word</strong>: N</p>\n<p><strong>Quit and restart game</strong>: Q</p>\n<p><em>Note that this is a prototype and therefore may not work as expected.
