{"id": 17319, "slug": "fruit-golf", "name": "Fruit Golf", "name_original": "Fruit Golf", "description": "Fruit Golf lets you wield the HTC Vive controllers as a club allowing you to swing your club just like you would in real life. If you have ever hit something with a stick, you can play Fruit Golf. Knock fruit around a variety of courses, like a farm house in the middle of an alien invasion, a kitchen just in time for a smoothie, and a graveyard ready for some compost. Fruit Golf allows four players to use one headset to play locally. Taking turns in the headset, connect iOS and Android devices to rain terror down on the player currently golfing by dropping obstacles and other hazards in their way. Make sure to work together to maximise the damage! Seamlessly add or drop players after each hole so there\u2019s no need to play all the holes if you don\u2019t want to.  Join the premiere local VR experience and try not to make the fruit too sad.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b88f1f5690575500bb33c3b1dba34cc.jpg", "website": "http://www.coalcar.ca/fruitgolf", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coal Car Studio"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coal Car Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
