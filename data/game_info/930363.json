The start of the game finds them chillin' on their front porch one evening gazing upon their trash pile domain, when suddenly a bright white meteorite strikes the junkyard, starting the place ablaze. They glance at each other knowingly. The\u00a0<strong>Angelichrome</strong>\u00a0is back. The chrome-plated, ancient monstrosities were thought to be wiped out during the war, but Slag and Hino always knew the fuckers would return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pair don their regalia and set out to\u00a0<em>crack some FUCKIN chrome</em>.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\n<p>You play as\u00a0<em>both beetles at the same time</em>. left stick/bumper/trigger controls Slag, and the opposite controls Hino. Your task is to fuck up the angelichrome horrors using weapons constructed from scrap around the junkyard. Our heroes are masters of improvised weapons due to their harrowing experiences in the trenches together\u00a0(this is also where they fell in love but that's not important right now).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T17:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf44959fc438bdc1aa23f3111c774be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Hive"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
