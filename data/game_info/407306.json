We had the task to create a videogame for the play station platform in about 4 months and so we did. Later I realized we never published that game anywhere so here it is :)</p>\n<p>This game is a platform shooter inspired in Smash Bros and Duck Game with quick action and a lot of weapons to play with. You can even use the defeated bodies of your friends as weapons :D! Throwing a Ragdoll Grandma can be as deadly as a black hole in this game. Its a really simple project but he had a lot of fun playing it in the development</p><ul><li>Controls (XBOX gamepad):<ul><li>Right Trigger to shoot your weapon or swing a ragdoll or hammer</li><li>X to throw your weapon. Some weapons are just small and will make other players drop their weapons, others, like hammers or grandmas, are heavy enough to kill them.</li><li>Left Thumbstick to move</li><li>A to jump. You can jump over other players to force them to drop their weapons.</li><li>You can jump down in some platforms to fall to the next platform below it</li></ul></li><li>Credits.<ul><li>Edward Burden</li><li>Gergely Daku</li><li>Xavier Rebasa</li><li>Imanol Saenz</li><li>Quique Alemany</li><li>Angelina Kelli</li><li>Yen-My Phung</li><li>Tom A Clayton</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/576/57615f24420a527a64b9cfb991c9eac9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["litelboy"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
