{"id": 441396, "slug": "still-rose", "name": "Still Rose", "name_original": "Still Rose", "description": "<p><em>The witch Alice had been a prisoner in an old tower for centuries, until one day Dahl accidentally broke the curse keeping her in there...\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p><strong>Still Rose</strong> is a 2D adventure game about two mages, Alice and Dahl. Alice has lost her powers, so they have left on a journey to search for mysterious ruins where they hope to find the Staff of Nelaeryn, which could possibly restore them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ruins are guarded by ghosts, so the player has to fight their way through them using both Alice and Dahl, because they both have their unique abilities. Alice may not have her powers, but she is very handy with all things Old Magic, and Dahl is very effective in battles.</p>\n<p>This demo has two levels, forest and a dungeon with small puzzle elements. It's quite short so if you're quick, it can be played through in about 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>You can play as both Alice and Dahl and you can switch between them simply by clicking the right mouse button.</p>\n<p>Still Rose\u00a0is playable in browser, or you can download it for free! <em>(Note that downloadable version only works on Windows!)</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------<br/></p>\n<p><em>Still Rose was my thesis production for Oulu University of Applied Sciences in spring 2020. Graphics were made by me (Tecsiederp)\u00a0and programming was done by my lovely fiance Akselmo. (You should check out his games too!)</em></p>\n<p>Currently I'm not sure if I will do more with this project, but I'd love to tell the full story of Alice and Dahl in some format one day since this demo is really just a tiny oneshot. Time will tell.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>You can follow Still Rose on Twitter!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:58:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1e1d3df3f5eac6e92824db820a82c06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tecsiederp"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
