Amelias biggest dream is to reach the stratosphere and to bring down the legendary Skywhale, which promises riches and fame for a lifetime.<br/><br/>In the world she lives in, fishing isn\u2019t a hobby - it\u2019s a risky and competitive job.

She travelled through the deserts with her father Francesco, dealing with all the dangers of the migration on their path.<br/><br/>Francisco sacrificed himself to have Amelia finally reach the Above, but that city called Granaria seems not as welcoming, as she hoped it will be. It is a harsh society with a strong class system. Disillusioned, miserable and alone, Amelia worked as a child labourer in an airplane factory for years. Clawing he way up, she works now as a part-time fisherman and part-time mechanic at a small corner-shop fixing airplanes. <br/>She tries to make her way to a better life.<br/><br/>The problem of overfishing of the sea ecosystem is one of the topic we want to add to gameplay in AIRHEART.<br/>Overfishing is one of the biggest resource problems of the world. In our universe, fish are a seemingly unlimited resource that can be harvested into cash. Over time, this gives us the possibility make the resource scarcer for every player, transforming the lush seas of the sky into a battle zone, where fighting is essential to survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We are Blindflug Studios, an indie game studio from Switzerland.
