It was the first game I built well over a year ago now, but it is very fun to play in my opinion, though it might be confusing! <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Basically, once you get into the game, you click on one of the balls on screen to access a Level. </p><p>When you're in the level, controls are as follows:</p><p>  'M' - Takes you to the Menu</p><p> 'W A S D' - For movement</p><p>'Space Bar' - To Jump</p><p>'E' - To Press Buttons</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Contact</strong></p><p>Thanks for checking out my game and feedback is greatly appreciated!
