Bad news, hero. In the Spiral Shards, we can only send in one hero at a time to fight the Ceaseless Dirge. At some point, a flaming blue fireball, mech mortar rocket, or giant spike of doom is going to hit you in the face, and you\u2019re going to die. That\u2019s when the fun begins. <br/><br/>When you die, you\u2019ll leave behind an Echo of your hero on the battlefield. The next hero in line will be able to resurrect your Echo as an AI battle companion. Take turns continuing each other\u2019s games, fighting and dying with friends until you have an entire army of Echoes by your side. Everyone dies. Heroes continue. <br/><br/>Next Up Hero is a 2D action adventure driven by Community Continue.
