It's about a spaceship's travel through levels where it can change colours and avoid certain obstacles while others remain in the way.\r\n</p>Instructions<p>There is an in-game tutorial at the first level but here the controls are:</p><p>WASD to move forward, backwards and rotate. Q and E to change colours (between 5 different colours). Shooting is executed on the spacebar.</p><p>If you are the same colour as an obstacle in your path, you cannot pass it. You therefore have to change your colour. Your shots inherit the same colour as your current and cannot pass objects of the same colour. Enemies come after you and ignore all obstacles (as do their shots).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d8/7d8ce58ac4b854c306fcd6224dadd5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["EKC"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
