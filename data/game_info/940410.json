As a vegetable commando, you're the resistance's last best hope in ending this bitter war.</p>\n<p>Play as one of\u00a0three different vegetable commandos, and fight through procedurally-generated battlefields scarred with desperate trenches and pockmarked with ever increasing artillery craters to reach the mysterious onion general who has been leading the Onion forces.</p>\n\n\n<strong>7DRL:</strong>\u00a0I made the game\u00a0in 7 days for the 7DRL Challenge 2023 game jam, where participants try to make a roguelike game in a week. I approached this by making a modern non-traditional real-time action adventure with vegetables at war with each other. Trenches are pretty much dungeons with open tops that you can jump out of and duck down into for protection.\u00a0I wanted to explore what it was like to have a proc-gen dungeon that dynamically changes over time.<br/>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The settings menu and the quit button on the title screen don't work -\u00a0press ESC to quit.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>POST-JAM TO-DO:\u00a0</strong>There's a lot that I didn't get to make before the 7 jam days were up for me. There is no ending, no onion general boss, and no leveling up like I had originally planned. Also the were no shovels and tomato grenades - which the player would have used to carve their own trenches/craters too.\u00a0There were also 2 other enemies (garlic and hot chili pepper)\u00a0I\u00a0made but they didn't make it into the final build for the jam. I didn't test beyond the 4th battle zone either, because my character always died in that zone.</p>\n<p>If there's enough interest, I might make a full game out of this, but right now I need to rest and recover from the jam. It was grueling. I\u00a0had started a completely different VR-based roguelike for the jam, but abandoned it and then made this.</p>\n<p>For credits and attributions, please see the credits_and_attributions.txt file in the download.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Control</strong>MoveWASD/Arrow keysJumpSpacebar (hold to jump higher)FireLeft clickReloadR key.
