Each completed level takes you one step closer to Puppyland.\u00a0</li><li>Each consumed body of biomatter\u00a0converts to 10 seconds worth of fuel, which means you'll have to consume a body at least every 10 seconds in order to avoid critical operational failure.</li><li>Use a variety of actions such as e.g. dashing and spawning of bone blocks to\u00a0progress and\u00a0traverse through the environment.
