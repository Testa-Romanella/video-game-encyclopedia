Defend your main base from aliens for as long as you can by building units and structures.</p>\n<p>The player starts out with the main base and a couple light units. A few enemies start attacking towards the main base. The player can choose to build generators to provide more income, start making more units through a barracks-building or build defensive turrets to deny enemies coming from a certain direction.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>The enemy \"snails\" and \"whales\" rush towards the base in ever-increasing amounts, wave by wave. Try to build up an effective defense quick and you might just survive for survive for longer than last time.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits<br/><br/>Graphics artists:<br/>Eeva S\u00e4il\u00e4, Terhikki Kataja, Jonas Forsman<br/><br/>Programming:<br/>Hannes Salo, Eetu Maunuksela<br/><br/>Sound &amp; Music:<br/>Lassi K\u00e4h\u00e4r\u00e4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3195beb96f071c0abdaa082937e9a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Statroware"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
