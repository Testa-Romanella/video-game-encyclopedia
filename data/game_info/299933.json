Are ye ready?</p>\n<p><strong>Core Dynamic</strong><br/>Our core dynamic is destruction. Our game is level-based and progression from one level to the next comes from killing all enemies in the level. Our game mechanics and enemy behaviour are intended to make the combat more interesting, as the player must manage their ship movement controls, get used to shooting perpendicular to their facing and handle reload times so that there is added depth to the game beyond point-and-click destruction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T03:32:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cc/1cc3a475dd9d0a7e6391546f92162793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aluxian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
