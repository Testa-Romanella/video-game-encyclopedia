So it was made in a very short time period (though admittedly copying some graphics and a few pieces of code used in other projects to save time) and so is quite basic in terms of functionality. All sounds featured are licensed via Soundsnap.com.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The theme for this Jam was \"Do\u00a0It Yourself\". My interpretation (alright liberal interpretation) of this theme was that sometimes in life you don't want to let someone else do something for you, it matters to you that you do it yourself.\u00a0To that end,\u00a0I made a game about a man trying to destroy the world before aliens can.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Here's the description:\r\n</p>\n<p>Aliens are trying to destroy the world.</p>\n<p>THIS SHALL NOT STAND!</p>\n<p>You\u2019re Doctor Thaddeus Von Notverygood and you\u2019re going to do it yourself.</p>\n<p>Use your energy gun to destroy the aliens\u2019 energy balls as they fall before they can turn the earth into a giant bomb.</p>\n<p>If an energy ball\u00a0is about to land on your lab, activate the shield button.</p>\n<p>Make sure you take the time to work on your own bomb.</p>\n<p>When your bomb is complete, ka-silence (sound of not having ears anymore).</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee8a9e45ec066738f532651dacbd8b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theta and Pi Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
