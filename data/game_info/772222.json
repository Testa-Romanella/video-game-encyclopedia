Anyways, I hope you will have as much fun playing the game as i did making it :)\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>if you come across any bugs and glitches in the game please send me a message and i will try to fix them.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T11:38:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec3/ec3c3a6770e06a224981cdfd367947ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blisterboi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
