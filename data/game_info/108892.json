I pride myself on having accomplished 2 weeks work in 5 days, although it's still missing a whole lot).</p><p>Controls: WASD (or right mouse) to move camera. Hold shift to rotate camera.</p><p>Click buy, plop house and a field (when you select field you can choose crop type).</p><p>Crop table:</p><p>(qpc - quantity per cell, $pkg - dollars per kilogram)</p>Carrots - harvest every 3 months. Cost 2 $pkg. QPC 6-8 kg. Easiest to grow.\r\nPotatoes - harvest every year. Cost is 7 $pkg. QPC 4-6 kg.\r\nGrain - harvest every year. Cost is 7 $pkg. QPC 4-8 kg. \r\nRice - harvest every 3 months. Cost is 2 $pkg. QPC 6-9 kg.<p>Specific plants require specific amounts of moisture and minimal appropriate level of fertility. (when you plop a field larger than 1 cell you get average moisture and fertility among cells it was plopped on).</p><p>Plants auto harvested if you have storage. After harvest, since there is no dynamic market system yet - sell them. If not harvested - crops will start to decay at triple of normal silo decay rate. </p><p>Right now a whole lot of features are missing:</p><p>-pests extermination per pesticide, weeds removal per herbicide, pH balancing via fertilization</p><p>-worker system with A* pathfinding towards field and their animations,</p><p>-some sounds, </p><p>-better music, </p><p>-season cycle+weather system, </p><p>-pseudo-dynamic market system, </p><p>-vehicular system, </p><p>-barns, animal system</p><p>-dynamic market with dynamic supply/demand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/2908e37463e17a0f41e7e4f86eba056b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smoke Fumus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
