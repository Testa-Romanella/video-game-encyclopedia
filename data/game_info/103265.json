Are you a bad enough air traffic controller to rescue all the passengers?\r\n</p>Features<ul>\n<li>6 colors!</li>\n<li>Hundreds of pixels!</li>\n<li>Public domain sound effects!</li>\n<li>Endless procedural gameplay!</li>\n<li>Male and Female characters!</li><li>Made in a week!</li>\n<li>Pay what you want!</li>\n</ul>Links<p>\r\n\tIf you liked this game, follow me on Twitter, or check out my other games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe5/fe55fcd5e9546833212612f63a288ddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Daniel Ratcliffe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
