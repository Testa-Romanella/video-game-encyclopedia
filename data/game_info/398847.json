It's just as bad as you'd probably expect, maybe even worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It features a singleplayer mode against 3 increasingly difficult opponents as well as a local multiplayer mode. The entire game is made from pure C# and all of the assets used are verified as free to use, including the music. Searching for assets killed a good bit of my time. I'm a programmer, not a visual artist. I did what I could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had plans for an actual tutorial, game sound effects, etc, but I ran up against the deadline.</p>\n<p>If anyone plays it I'd be happy to hear what you think. I'm going to go pass out now. Have a nice day.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebf27a5f758cc9fbe2c739cdcf5ab563.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LockeKosta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
