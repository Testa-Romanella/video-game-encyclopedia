I accidentally got a bit away from the AI theme (more is explained in-game if you're curious), but I think it turned out alright. It's nothing very original. The level changes as you walk around, which I thought was neat. Your goal is to escape the goblins' labyrinth/lair and reach the exit portal. Without dying. Hopefully.<br/></p><p>(Note: I haven't tested this on anything other than Windows, though it should theoretically work fine.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b7415f634fff3da4d92b83dc71889120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PeculiarCarrot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
