The only thing the three characters have in common is the first person view, which fully immerses the player in every character\u2019s life.THEMESThe Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION tells stories about several serious themes: from euthanasia to the death penalty, from war to love, from bullying to discrimination. Every one of them is tied to the other by the game\u2019s main themes: personal growth and the different ways of perceiving reality.<br/><br/>CHARACTERSThe player chooses how to face every experience, so every playthrough can be different depending on what decisions the player takes. The characters are extremely different, both visually and control related. The child sees the world in vibrant colors, eager to explore it, while the adult has a narrower, desaturated view except for the things he really cares about. Control wise, the old man moves slowly, with a shaking camera, to simulate how an elderly person moves; while the child can run and jump freely.<br/><br/><br/>CONTENTThe Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION will feature 10 Experiences, 30 Levels and more than 70 Significant Choices. This will let you build your own personal life experience, that will lead you to a choice-dependent ending. Can you face yourself? Do you think you'll be able to make the right decision at the right time? There\u2019s only one way to find out, PLAY THE GAME!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f986d70e5810431690a7393c0d6f63eb.jpg", "website": "https://www.cybercoconut.com/the-way-of-life-definitive-edition/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 26, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CyberCoconut"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["CyberCoconut"], "esrb_rating": null}
