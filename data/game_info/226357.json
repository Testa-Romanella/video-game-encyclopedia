{"id": 226357, "slug": "sudoku-rainbow", "name": "Sudoku Rainbow", "name_original": "Sudoku Rainbow", "description": "Sudoku Rainbow is the traditional nine by nine puzzle made with colors instead of numbers. The colors can be selected from a palette of nine colors. The selected color shows up in a color choice bar. The blank squares can then be filled with the selected color simply by touching them. The object of the game is to fill all the blank squares, such that every column has one of each of the colors, and every row has one of each of the colors, and every major nine by nine square (shown by line borders) has one of each of the colors. There is an optional timer which you can use to time yourself on your solutions. There are color selection bars which allow you to change the colors. There are three levels of difficulty: easy, medium and hard. There is only one valid solution to each puzzle. If you find it, you will see a reward.<br/><br/>There are various strategies which can be used to solve the different types of problems. Playing the game is the best way to develop your own strategies through practical experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb936cffc3094ed1d150d258b427eedd.jpg", "website": "http://sudokurainbow.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Sudoku Rainbow Project", "darragh nagle"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["darragh nagle"], "esrb_rating": null}
