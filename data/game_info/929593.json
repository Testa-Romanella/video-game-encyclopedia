No questioning it, you're dead.</p>\n<p>However, you may choose to reincarnate and play as a different creature, with an entirely new set of minigames. They're all equally as likely to kill you and hopefully equally as funny!</p>\n<p>Though, you will wanna do well at these minigames. For each minigame you beat in one life, you get a little time boost during the next life. This may not seem like much, but remember, numbers add up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T11:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16fc98c66686b7b038133039adb5cdd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["RabbitAddix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
