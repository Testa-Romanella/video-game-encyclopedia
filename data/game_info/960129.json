Who is a ghost, and who is not? Are you still you?\r\n\r\n\"Paper Bride 4 Bound Love\" is a Chinese horror puzzle game, the fourth work in the \"Paper Bride\" series. Welcome everyone to return to the world of Paper Bride. This time, let us uncover the secrets of Yichang Town together.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to create a different experience for each paper bride. In the previous few works, we tried to deconstruct puzzle solving and folklore in different aspects (such as physical puzzle solving, burning paper for ourselves, etc.).\r\nAnd this work, we intend to go back to the basics, try a more traditional direction, and restore the feeling of old-fashioned classic folk movies.\r\n\r\nNew works will continue to be upgraded:\r\n\u262fTraditional Chinese folk culture upgrade - more Chinese folk culture and metaphysics, more paper puppets.\r\n\u262fArt upgrade\u2014the art department has a few new monsters (masters), and things like paper figurines will be even weirder.\r\n\u262fHeartbeat upgrade\u2014\u2014Different paper fans have different evaluations on the heartbeat speed of the previous game. Some people said it was more exciting, while others said \"it's not as good as the previous one\". So this time we dare not use too much force, just increase it by 0.01 times\uff01No entrance for heart disease patients!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T02:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/60843251f4da2cb3d3b7cdb9d4c8c6c8.jpg", "website": "https://www.gamefps.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeartBeat Plus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HeartBeat Plus"], "esrb_rating": null}
