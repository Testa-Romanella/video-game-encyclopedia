It is inspired by the <em>Prose-Descriptive Qualities</em> (<em>PDQ</em>) system            by Atomic Sock Monkey Press, and shares its love of simplicity and story over complex            simulation and competition.            </p>\n<p>            Things the <em>ASCRS</em> does well:            </p>\n<ul><li>Quick and easy character creation</li><li>Gives role-players important choices to make at every turn</li><li>Lets lower-level characters do awesome stuff in the same conflict as higher-level characters</li><li>Makes teamwork count -- two or three characters working together can overcome a powerful character that would wipe the floor with any one of them</li></ul>\n<p>            Things you should NOT expect from the <em>ASCRS</em>:            </p>\n<ul><li>High-level characters being nigh-untouchable to low-level characters (although a few extra levels do make you a lot more likely to win a one-versus-one in the long run)</li><li>Detailed rules for simulating every aspect of a world or type of conflict</li><li>Complex statistics and abilities that support building characters with mechanical advantages over others</li><li>Predictable outcomes to conflicts</li></ul>\n<p>            The <em>Awesome-Sauce Conflict Resolution System</em> Unity app is an application which            takes care of many aspects of the <em>ASCRS</em> for you, like figuring out what dice to roll for            a particular action and determining what the outcome is. It is designed to be relatively            flexible, allowing the users to customize the mechanics and even alter the outcomes.            </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e8948d3da9d3e4d3461eb025b2cc9cb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AubreyTheBard"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
