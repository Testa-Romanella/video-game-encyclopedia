This game was designed to be used for relaxation, a place where people could just admire the beauty of a distant place and forget any worries they have in their real lives. The main focus of the developers is the well-being of the player, as they state. It was meant to be a safe harbor from any chores, stresses and other aspects of a usual day to day life.</p>\n<p>There are no objectives whatsoever present in the game. The players are free to explore the island in a way they see fit. It is possible to collect shelves or fruit, but it is not forced upon the players by the game. The game features 12 achievements based on the finding the shelves and fruit mentioned above. </p>\n<p>During the gameplay, the players can find each other in an in-game world if they create a special &quot;Connection&quot; (or adding themselves to a Steam friend list). There is no player-to-player interaction apart from that. The players can&#39;t see each other models. Instead, a special pre-defined &quot;essence&quot; model is used to show other players in your online session.</p>\n<p>It is possible to play the game without a VR headset, though it is recommended to be played as a VR title.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/cccb4952af7d15d553cf4d70843c753e.jpg", "website": "http://www.chubbypixel.com", "rating": 1.57, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 844, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fabio Ferrara", "Giulia Airoldi", "Fabio Mosca"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chubby Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
