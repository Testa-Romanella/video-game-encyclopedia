My teammate and I finished the game in one week. Before beginning the project, I had some experience with Unity, but I had never completed a game. While working on the project, my friend learned everything there is to know about unity. I was responsible for the majority of the work because I had more experience with unity.</p>\n<p>link for the github:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/LightningFz/Grade11FinalProject<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:28:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3d0d9290ffa9e19976872dc2385900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LightningFz"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
