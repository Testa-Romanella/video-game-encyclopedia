I don't think I implemented well the dice mechanic because they stated it can't be a random number generator but I don't care because I learnt a lot about Godot in those 3 days and overall I like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c29/c29d3bef409a663a711bb63aeeaa63f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Firminou"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
