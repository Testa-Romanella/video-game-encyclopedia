It is an animated experience of 40 minutes  so sit back, relax and enjoy. It uses a procedural random seed to create a unique path for the line so that everytime it is played you will have a different experience. Perfect for relaxing and reflecting after a busy day at work.<br/></p>\n<p>Once there was a Line, <br/>sometimes wide, sometimes thin, sometimes striped but mostly plain, <br/>not far in its tread from the bed, this line witnessed an unfamiliar bend, <br/>for lo and behold; there were other lines! <br/>some thin and short, <br/>others squat and ellongated, <br/>some traced curves, others spirals, <br/>color clad or simple tailored <br/>ziz-zagging here and there in a sprawl, <br/>our Line wasn't sure quite what but to do, <br/>so off it went with much ado, <br/>to who knows where to. <br/>This is the story of a line. </p>\n<p>Input:<br/>'ESC' key to access the menu (control audio levels, quit) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aad/aadd4dc25ee8c6b2fcd9bcaba0c3b8fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Colorfiction"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
