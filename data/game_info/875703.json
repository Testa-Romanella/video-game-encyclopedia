I couldn't complete it because of school and irl stuff.</p>\n<p>Right now, it's just a demo of a working pathfinder. There's just one AI unit that moves towards the player unit. The unit selection menu doesn't work. It just shows the possible moves that the player can make.</p>\n<p>The game once completed will have a weapon triangle system like Fire Emblem.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, it will be completed by the end of November :)<br/></p>\n<p>Tested the prototype on the mGBA 0.9.3 and 2DS (vc injector) and it works :)<br/></p>\n<p>The code is open source. Feel free to take a peek at the source code. You can also use the pathfinder in your own games :D !</p>\n<p>https://github.com/pyroceper/rock_paper_shotgun_tactics<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nD-PadMove cursor<br/>SelectABackB\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\nProgrammingpyroceperArtmattwalkden", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/411/4115d34abb3f09818eb97469fab76bee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pyroceper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
