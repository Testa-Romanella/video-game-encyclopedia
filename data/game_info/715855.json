The Webcam of your computer sees your movements and translates them into the movements of Santa, where the objective is to not be caught by little Johnny as he randomly turns around. Johnny isn't wearing his glasses, so deciphering still objects/people is difficult for him, but when he sees moving objects he can tell who it is! That's why it's important that Santa doesn't move when Johnny turns around!</p>\n<p>Rules:<br/></p>\n<p>1. You can only jog(move) when the music is on and the tree has a green dot on top.</p>\n<p>2. When music pauses and there is a red dot on top of the Christmas tree you must stop</p>\n<p>3. The white dot moves are you move and in order to win, the white dot must pass the finish line.</p>\n<p>4. Make sure your whole body is in the frame for the game to start.</p>\n<p>5.
