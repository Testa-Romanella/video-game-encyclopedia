It's a short platformer, with a built in dialogue tree. \u00a0The story is about a teenager having to deal with the death of their father, and the conversation you hear is after the son has started therapy to deal with the loss.</p>\n<p>The key is, that you choose what you say based on what platform you land on. I\u00a0hope to make a game in the future that uses this idea to it's fullest extent, because right now it's just a proof of concept.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A &amp; D/Left &amp; Right - Move</li><li>Spacebar - Jump (hold to jump higher)</li><li>That's it!\u00a0Very simple.</li></ul>\n<p>This is the first \"game\" that I've ever created and released, so it's not as polished as I'd like, but I hope to get better with time. Hopefully this idea can inspire a few people!</p>\n<p>Written in C++ using the SFML Library.</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer: Daniel Cordell (crdlpls)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music is\u00a0<strong>Bittersweet by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0CynicalMonkey on Discord for asking me what I wanted to make for the jam, giving me the idea for this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad901da4f841af566782f28779875e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crdlpls"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
