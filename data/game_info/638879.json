As my first game made on Unity it was quite the challenge, but I manage to put a decent game. I'll probably make a better version in the future that add power-ups and other interesting concepts. In any case, I hope you enjoy my game as much I enjoyed making it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Use the mouse to direct the paddle.
