Evade the filled circles that fill the screen, chasing your poor little mouse pointer. Meanwhile, click the quick-and-sly unfilled shapes to gain points.</p><p>As you gain points, you rise through the levels. At each level, there are more circles, and they all move faster; the game gets more and more intense.</p><p>When you touch a filled circle, you lose a life. When you run out of lives, it's game over!</p><p>There are four graphics modes; calm, crazy (<em>epilepsy warning!</em>), disco, and white. To be honest, none of the modes are the most epileptic-friendly ever, due to the nature of the game, but without doubt the Crazy mode is off-limits to anyone who has ever even looked at the sun for too long and got dizzy.</p><p>The music is by me. Sound effects were made with BFXR.
