Explores my early childhood, high school, college, and career moving forward.</p>\n<p>Very hastily made in my free time outside of work.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it, are able to learn a little about me, and maybe feel inspired to make an introspective game, yourself. Send it my way if you do!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:35:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f9754944ec7fdb9032f3f4fc331b20e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
