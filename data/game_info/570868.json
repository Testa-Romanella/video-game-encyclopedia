In this\u00a0remote sector of the galaxy we hope to find the relics that can save our planet Earth from a mysterious disease that has already took millions of lives.<br/></p>\n<p>Star Fleet has gathered a crew of\u00a0elite captains that lead away teams in search of\u00a0the relics. But the sectors are filled with raiders so it will be a dangerous voyage.<br/></p>\n<p>We need you to guide us.\u00a0You are our last hope.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Use a joystick in port 2 to control the USS Firebird. Hold the joystick in a direction and press FIRE to fly there. Repair any damage at stations.</p>\n<p>When fighting raiders hold LEFT and press FIRE\u00a0to flee. Hold\u00a0RIGHT and press FIRE to launch a torpedo. Just pressing FIRE will take evasive actions. This will lower the chance to get hit temporarily.</p>\n<p>Make you way to each planet and beam down an\u00a0away team. Control the entire team with the joystick and lead the captain into the temple. Avoid the sentinel lasers. Make sure the captain and at least one team member stay alive to gain a relic.<br/></p>\n<p>Make it back to DS709 with all 3 relics to win the game.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Written by\u00a0Alexander \"paaco\" Paalvast\u00a0for the\u00a0C64 Cassette 50 Charity Competition.
