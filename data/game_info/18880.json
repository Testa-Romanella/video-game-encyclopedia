The 20th century is still young.<br/>\r\nAn unfamiliar 20th century - in an unfamiliar world.<br/>\r\nThis is a world that experienced a 19th century very different from our own. A world filled with innumerable steam-powered Engines. <br/>\r\nThe unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization has left the world's skies shrouded in grey... and its seas dyed in shades of black.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Sea\" - Once, the word suggested an expanse of blue. Today, it refers to something dark and putrid.<br/>\r\nThe former harbor city of Marseille in the European Kingdom of France looks out on a sea as black as any other. But these particular waters are home to something that can't be found anywhere else on Earth...<br/>\r\nA massive artificial island, solid and imposing as a fortress. A city in its own right, but also a school; a place bursting with life and color.<br/>\r\nIts formal name: The Marseille Offshore Academia.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Academia - a city founded on cutting-edge engine science; an academy designed to produce the greatest Erudite Scholars in the world. <br/>\r\nIt stands above a sea fouled by the flourishing of modern civilization.<br/>\r\nIt sits below a sky polluted by the emissions of countless Engines.<br/>\r\nAnd nonetheless, it shines like a jewel, filled with the radiance of students glorying in their youth.<br/>\r\nThis is a place so overflowing with energy as to recall the long-lost sun.<br/>\r\nA place that glitters with a beauty reminiscent of the long-lost stars.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, the Academia is also a city with a secret. Beneath its facade hides a darkness feared even by the French monarchy.<br/>\r\nSpecifically... the school lies under the control of the \"English West India Company,\" a secret society that rules Europe's underworld with an iron first.<br/>\r\nNot even the agencies of the great European powers could expose the Academia's true nature; powerless to interfere, heads of mighty states can only watch warily for some sign that might reveal the Society's intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Academia - a gorgeous island closed off completely to the outside world.<br/>\r\nA school that no student is permitted to leave, except as successful \"graduates.\"<br/>\r\nA society of the young and for the young, self-sufficient and proudly independent.<br/>\r\nA city-state under the absolute rule of the \"Governing Council,\" an elite body composed of the \"Fraternity\" and \"Sorority\"... and a subordinate branch of the English West India Company.<br/>\r\nA radiant distortion in the fabric of the world, continually producing both brilliant young talent and fearsome supernatural Arts.<br/>\r\nA carefully-cultivated, absolutely impenetrable garden of secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, in the spring of 1908... A single young man appears within its walls.<br/>\r\nAfter declaring his intent to wage war against the Governing Council, he introduces himself in this way:<br/>\r\n\"Nikola Tesla. 72 years old. I'm a transfer student.\"<br/>\r\n\"Students of the Marseille Offshore Academia. My hundred thousand young friends, cursed by fate.\"<br/>\r\n\"...I will save every last one of you with my own two hands.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd at the summit of Ch\u00e2teau d'If, a bell rings out.<br/>\r\nThe Bell of Gahkthun, announcing that the time of rejoicing is at hand...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec043733f2fd34cc0c630ed05cc87bf.jpg", "website": "http://mangagamer.org/gahkthun/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 16, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 535, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liar-soft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
