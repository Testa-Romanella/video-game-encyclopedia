So temper your expectations to a tempered temperature, or I'll throw a temper-tantrum.</p><p>A short, humorous (according to the author), interactive story where you can choose how things go down. With tightly-knit dialogue trees that don't branch very much at all, you'll be wondering why you were given a choice in no time! Bonus understanding is given to Unity developers. Bonus misunderstanding is given to non-Unity developers who will be out of the for loop. In fact, you might even say this is a sort of combination (yswidt?) of Unity game development and non-Unity game development, in a <strong>theme-obeying</strong> way.</p>\n<p>Length: &lt;1 second if you read and click REALLY fast. About 3 to 6 minutes if you read as fast as you probably read, probably.</p>\n<p>Mobile-friendly. This interactive story is platonic friends with mobile phones.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/773c949d3677750416d45b4abf9425c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beard or Die"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
