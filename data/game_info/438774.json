Every positive action you take -- firing, killing enemies, and even staying alive -- increases your threat level. A higher threat level increases your score multiplier, but affects how deadly the enemy forces become. You can decrease your threat level by withholding fire, sparing enemies, and sacrificing your ship. Aim for the high score and surpass yourself!</p>\n<p>-Credits-</p>\n<p>Created by Jonathan So</p>\n<p>\"Vector Waves\" font by Darrell Flood, available here:\u00a0https://www.1001freefonts.com/vector-waves.font</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/619908b1934d465f46bd4e578c1f6132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonathan So"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
