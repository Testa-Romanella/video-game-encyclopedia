The overall goal is to see how long you can last in the game, attempting to beat your previous high score. It has a very retro arcade feel that is meant to bring countless experiences of play. The gameplay is simple to grasp and will continue to get gradually harder throughout. It is a fun challenge to try and see how many boss's you are able to defeat every 10 wave's of enemies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T04:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a0/1a0f4b7d51dea335fab06eb4e51c9729.jpg", "website": "http://www.nerdwithnoswag.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerdWithNoSwag"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NAMI TENTOU"], "esrb_rating": null}
