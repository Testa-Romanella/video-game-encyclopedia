Attend a schedule full of classes in time to gather the knowledge you need to succeed, and take responsibility for your own behaviour every step of the way. With hundreds of other students walking the halls, an equally important popularity contest challenges you to survive long enough to thrive... <br/><br/>Envisaged in 3D for the first time, there are dozens of locations to roam inside and outside of school - as well as an abundance of fully interactive props to get you through the day. You can also fine-tune the camera to enjoy the action from a variety of different angles.<br/><br/>Choose from hundreds of preset characters of any age, or upgrade to create your own by saving your changes to every character in the editor. Just when you think you've seen it all, a whole other career as a teacher awaits - which challenges you to impart knowledge as successfully as you learnt it!<br/><br/>* Acknowledging that school is the first (and only) place that many people experience violence, this is an unflinching exploration of how true morality can only ever grow out of the muddy waters of immorality. The game depicts a fictitious universe. Any similarity to real people, past or present, is coincidental.<br/><br/>** You can invest in a \"Private Education\" for your currency's equivalent of $3.99 per year to enjoy the game at its best with no ads and save your changes to each character to make the world your own.
