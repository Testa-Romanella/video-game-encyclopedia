{"id": 15712, "slug": "goodbye-deponia", "name": "Goodbye Deponia", "name_original": "Goodbye Deponia", "description": "<p>Goodbye Deponia is a point-and-click adventure, a third installment in the series.  The game\u2019s world consists of two primary locations, planet Deponia, literally composed of rubbish, and Elysium, a flying city, pure and beautiful, as the game\u2019s central character claims.<br />\nThe protagonist, Rufus, is an egoistic, indifferent to others and unaware of it, anti-hero set out on his quest of getting away from the dump that is Deponia. The player has to solve different puzzles, interact with other characters and do everything possible to help Rufus achieve his long-shot goal. The game doesn\u2019t forget about the protagonist\u2019s companions as well; different storylines will allow players to understand the world of Deponia better.<br />\nThe game features a unique art style, with hand-drawn 2D sprites, highly reminiscent of comic books. Despite the game\u2019s natural looks, most of the humor is connected to previous parts, and it is implied that the games should be played from the very beginning.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2013-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-02T14:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/187/187cf9fcec83be0ed55aaf96123fa948.jpg", "website": "http://www.deponia.de/en", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 126, "owned": 1819, "beaten": 227, "toplay": 35, "dropped": 25, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 156, "ratings_count": 255, "suggestions_count": 481, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 256, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
