Our fun and fast-paced game that encourages the business person in all of us. Using items, both edible and not so edible, you need to create delicious sandwiches for the children in your neighbourhood. At such a low price what could go wrong! Remember that soap isn't the most delicious sandwich filling.<br/></p>\n<p>As the timer counts down you will have to provide sandwiches for all your loyal customers, maybe making sure not to kill them.</p>\n<p>*PLEASE NOTE: Do not consume any items in this game without asking your parents. Also NO children were injured during the development of this game.*<br/>___</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>### Theme</p>\n<p>The theme, \"Start with nothing\" is represented in our game as you start with no money. You also start with not enough ingredients to supply edible food to customers, so opt for hunting around the house for items.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>### Development</p>\n<p>The game was developed in Unreal Engine. The art was created in Maya, and textured with flat colours in Unreal Engine. Substance Painter was used for several assets, while ZBrush was utilised for the characters. Photoshop was used to create the icons seen in the game, and also to produce any promo photos you see. The music and sound effects were composed in LMMS and were arranged using FMOD Studio. For version control we used GitKraken.</p><p>HOW TO PLAY</p><p>You need to reach \u00a3100, but you only have 2 minutes. And you can only sell sandwiches. The only way to succeed is to \"cheap out\" on some indredients. Make sure to keep an eye on their health, and goodluck!\u00a0</p><p>___</p>\n<p>### Tools Used<br/>- Unreal Engine<br/>- Maya<br/>- Photoshop<br/>- Substance Painter<br/>- GitKraken<br/>- Visual Studio Community<br/>- ZBrush<br/>- LMMS<br/>- FMOD Studio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c7e1cfe279cafaa131c0e984f5ee96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sollara Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
