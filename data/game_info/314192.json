Your\r\nparents left you at home to puppy-sit while they go to the grocery store, but you don\u2019t want to be\r\ncooped up inside on such a beautiful day. As you take your precious family pup out to the\r\nbackyard, he spots a hole in the bushes that wasn\u2019t there before and makes a mad dash to\r\nescape.\r\n</p>\n<p>Oh man, your parents are going to kill you if you don\u2019t get him back to the yard before they get\r\nhome from the store!\r\n</p>\n<p>Chase your dodgy dog as he trots an unpredictable route through the forest maze, maneuvering\r\naround obstacles such as streams and rocks. But watch out for the birds, because he loves to\r\nchase after them! Your dog is too mischievous for you to catch, but you have no choice but to\r\nfrantically chase him back home, or you\u2019re grounded forever! <br/><br/></p><p>This game is a group project created by Lauren Smith and Rachel Thieman for IMS 445.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T04:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06c3bf48db443c977f76ee6097fb626f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lauren Smith"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
