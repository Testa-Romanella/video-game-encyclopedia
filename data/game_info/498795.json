The basic concept of this game was that the player has to defeat enemies to open the portal to the next level, and the player gets out of hell. The game has 5 levels(same background with color change) and a boss fight in the last level.</p>\n<p>But! It became boring quickly, so I decided to upload it as a canceled game and also include the Unity Project of the game. If you need any help with the files, feel free to contact!.<br/></p>\n<p>Unity Version - 2019.4.3f1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9a3d9de2618fcead305ef2193b1d07d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Akki_1"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
