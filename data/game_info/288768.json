Both sides hit a ball that skyrockets between you and the other player. This game will be multiplayer as well as single player. Players can choose between different paddle types and can customize their paddles with different skins and textures and battle it out in different types of environments. The game will have brick sthat you can hit with the ball and some will have powerups. Some power ups include making your paddle longer and multiball but we dont want to give everything away!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe love playing classic games and it's clearly the inspiration for this vr title.  We are mixing Mechanics from Pong and Arknoid into a vr mashup where players from around the world can compete to see who is the best! We are releasing into early access soon and look forward to working with the community on turning this game into something everyone can enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/407ab32d433d68ec0865386506e1e5c1.jpg", "website": "https://www.treefort.me", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Adams", "Craig Burgess", "Drew Disher"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TREEFORT VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
