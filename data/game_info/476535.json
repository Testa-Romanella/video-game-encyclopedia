You are a security guard, and you'll throw whatever you have at hand at them so they think twice before doing it next time.</p>\r\nStatus\r\n<p>This game is currently in development, in what I would call an alpha phase.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The player moves with <strong>W/A/S/D</strong> and you can grab and throw things with <strong>Left Click.</strong></p>\r\nUpdates\r\n<p>The game won't be a lot bigger than this, but it certainly needs a menu (along with some configuration options), a loss situation and either a win situation or some kind of score. I will be fixing some reported bugs too. There WILL be more ideas added </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:05:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b3470cf3f39d30e1e1f3d63220f8053e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GamesThatTasteLikeGarlic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
