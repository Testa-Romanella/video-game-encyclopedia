The  game story follows the British crew on a galleon called\u00a0HMS  Observance\u00a0in the mid-18th century. Because their ship has been  significantly damaged, up to four players need to join forces and keep  it afloat by completing specific tasks until they reach their final  destination.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The module\u2019s brief was to develop a multiplayer game. As a result,  this project had two essential design pillars \u2013\u00a0making unique and  compelling gameplay with a high replayability prospect, and creating an  entertaining and light-hearted atmosphere filled with a humorous  narrative, fit to serve as a friendly and interactive environment for  the audience.\r\n    </p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>:<ul><li>Join the same server to play together\r\n</li><li>Use the WASD movement to move around the galleon\r\n</li><li>Use the mouse to rotate the first-person camera\r\n</li><li>Use  \u201cSpace\u201d key to jump, \u201cE\u201d key to pick up objects, \u201cQ\u201d key to drop them,  and \u201cF\u201d key to fix holes on the ship and destroy iceboxes\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><strong>Rules</strong>:<ul><li>Two factors influence the ship\u2019s condition \u2013 weight endurance and water overflow (displayed by their matching UI health bars)\r\n</li><li>If even one health bar reaches zero, the game session is over, and the players have lost\r\n</li><li>When  the timer (set in meters) reaches zero, and the health bars are both  above zero value, the game session is over, and the players have won\r\n</li><li>Picking up the fallen objects and dropping them off the ship increases the weight endurance health bar\r\n</li><li>The  players need to pick up a carrot, destroy the icebox with it, collect  the ice cream, and then fix the water leaks below the deck to increase  the water overflow health bar\r\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/4718b0fa29048302ef1826b2a75f2d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nina Makes Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
