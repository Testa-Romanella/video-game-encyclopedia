Here we have a demo of our first character and our first stage for everyone to play. We would like to get any and all feed back that we could on our concept and designs.</p>\n<p>Currently you can play with 2-4 player on the stage one arena as our ballerina character Aella (eye-la). Everyone gets 3 lives and once those are gone you are dead. If you also let the timer run down on top the game will end, so beat your friends quick.</p>\n<p>One thing we know of currently that we have to work out is controller support. By the full release we would like for everyone to use any controller they would like, but currently the game only supports controllers from the Xbox lineup (360 and one controllers). Also during the opening sections in the menu you must use a keyboard to select your characters and stage. Once your get in game it switches to controller.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy Project Atlas and please let us know what you would like to see be added or change to help make this games of ours great.</p>\n<p>If you would like to see more updates on Project Atlas or our Studio PermaQuest check us out at the links below.</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/permaquestgames</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/permaqueststudio/</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdEpGE3HMzwSYmWzDfaIbw</p>\n<p>Twitch:\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/permaquest</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa2ca31be9165c948a7087ed7c1c895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PermaQuest Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
