I did some of the pixel artwork and the lovely ClownishJoe made the potion.<br/><br/>If I were to continue the project I\u00a0would be adding unique artwork for all of the cards, character classes, character customization with a gold system. You would earn gold based on how well you did in the run. I would also balance the game a tad more and even possibly add more ability cards if I thought of more. Let me know your thoughts. This is my first game ever.</p><p>Thanks for trying the game out!</p><p>-BradsGaming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T05:39:12", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brads_Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
