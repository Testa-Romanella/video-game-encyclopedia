You as a warrior with your powerful weapons, magic, abilities, and most important; the skills. ---<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Choose your fighting style. Be a sword master and enjoy slashing the enemies, use heavy weapons to quake the ring, or use the magic and never get close to these <br/>\r\ncreatures!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Show the special ultimate of your equipment, use intelligence for the next step, plan your charge or defence, run the ring for gift of trees to get some potions, jump inside wells to get so far from the danger.<br/>\r\n\u2022 Some attacks of these things really can break everything just in seconds. How it feels to have a flipped view of world, or all is black, never stand in the same plot with the earthquake of hell, get slowed or stuck to the ground inside dozens of them, you need to act really faster before it! <br/>\r\n\u2022 A lot of things for you to destroy the enemy, even a magical phone that calls the your allies for incredible firepower!<br/>\r\n\u2022 Not over yet, though you used all of that, and nothing is left to use, time to call your big friends to the ring.<br/>\r\n\u2022 A dragon from another world, and the scary mutant is ready to smash every time for your service!<br/>\r\n\u2022 And after these, the gods of the bullring incomes!
