A player can only attack an enemies if someone from their team is standing on their (the player's) colored attack pad (diamond trigger). At least 1\u00a0of the team's members much reach the opposite side to win.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Originality:</strong>\n<p><em>The Great Escape</em>\u00a0is a unique game with a mix of two different genres - strategy and action. Players have to strategically move their characters across the island while fighting each other when necessary. Their end goal is to reach their opponents side.</p>\n<strong>Technical Merit:</strong>\n<p><em>The Great Escape\u00a0</em>is built using an object oriented approach in Unity. It\u00a0has local multiplayer for 4 players\u00a0among other things. It can also be\u00a0replayed multiple times and has UI implemented.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ol><li>Character one: Mouse to attack, arrows\u00a0to move when fighting.\u00a0 \u00a0</li><li>Character two:\u00a0O to attack, IJKL to move when fighting.\u00a0</li><li>Character three:\u00a0Y to attack, TFGH to move when fighting.</li><li>Character four:\u00a0E to attack, WASD to move when fighting.\u00a0<br/>\n</li></ol>\n<strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>\n<p>The hardest part in making this game was writing the networking code and\u00a0coming up with the idea/ designing mechanics. I'm quite new to Unity, let alone multiplayer networking, so it was a huge learning curve for me. I did end up decided to go the local multiplayer route at the end due to technical difficulties and time constraints.\u00a0But I'm happy to say I still did learn a lot about online multiplayer networking,\u00a0design, &amp; Unity in the process.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Assets:</strong>\n<p><strong>CODE</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Multiplayer code partly borrowed from tutorials by <strong>BlackThornProd</strong> and <strong>Info Gamer</strong> on Youtube.\u00a0 Hasn't been used in the latest version of the game, however.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>ART</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Map Sprites borrowed from\u00a0https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-level-map-pixel-art-assets-pack/?num=1&amp;count=...</li><li>Character sprites borrowed from\u00a0https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-3-character-sprite-sheets-pixel-art/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>SOUND EFFECTS</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>to be implemented\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>MUSIC</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Zero impression music track by d'aizl\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/daizl/Dexters_Pinkboratory/mtk096-va-bestofah...</li></ul>\n<strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>\n<p>I haven't played many other similar games like mine (or maybe strategy action/ shooter\u00a0games like Valorant fall into this category?\u00a0), but I was inspired by <strong>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime </strong>for multiplayer co-op, and\u00a0<strong>Rocket League</strong>\u00a0for the mixture of different game genres.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>\n<p><strong>Input Type:</strong>\u00a0Multiple input options including the mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Strategy-Action\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Play Style</strong>: Competitor, Explorer &amp; Collector\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>\u00a0What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?\r\n<p>I'm trying to experiment, and check if mixing two completely different genres will fit well together. I\u00a0might have to include a bit more strategy elements considering that I've lowered the player count to 4 and haven't implemented powerups yet - among other things.\u00a0Other than that, I want to test out how my game mechanic works out in a local multiplayer co-op setting.\u00a0</p>\r\nMap\r\n\n<ul><li><strong>Yellow Box</strong> is the treasure the marines have to reach.
