He is the leader of the circuit breakers but his drive and confidence is unmatched and encourages the rest of the team to bring their A game. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to wipe that smile off his face by sporting a bigger robot body count than him? Aldo's machine gun strikes a solid balance between range and power for an all-around great weapon.<br/> <br/><br/><strong>Weapon Type: Shotgun</strong><br/>There are few that rival Shelbys straightforward attitude. She is often mistaken as cold, but if you have a plan you want to set in motion, Shelby\u2019s the girl who can follow through. Her weapon of choice, the shotgun allows Shelby to get up close and personal. Every other member of the team keeps their distance from the robots but Shelby thrives when close to the enemy.<br/> <br/><br/><strong>Weapon Type: Missile</strong><br/>There are many things you can say about Samson, but clever isn\u2019t one of them. He is the team\u2019s explosive guy, delivering a tremendous amount of damage with his signature missile launcher. Samson loves explosions and if you give him a recipe for a bomb, he will tell you the exact size of the explosion with 100% accuracy. So what Samson lacks in general knowledge he more than makes up for in explosive know-how.<br/> <br/><br/><strong>Weapon type: Laser</strong><br/>Aldo would never openly admit it, but Tay is the real brains of the operation. She is responsible for creating the weapons that the Circuit Breakers team uses today.  Her weapon of choice, the laser gun matches her interest in engineering. There are many scientific teams requesting her knowledge in the field of engineering, but she prefers the application instead of the theory.Other titles from Excalibur Games<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea2db705b7d51f01da1e20a731a71db.jpg", "website": "http://www.excalibur-publishing.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 195, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Excalibur Games", "Triverske"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Excalibur Games", "Triverske"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
