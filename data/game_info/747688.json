Syoudre here, thank you for trying out this script! This time it is purposely\u00a0for the Bullet Hell Artistry 5: Unbelievable Allies contest held by Bullet Hell Engines.\u00a0Where the theme is about making a boss battle where a selected Touhou character is paired with\u00a0another character from a video game.\u00a0The scenario of the script is inspired by the MMD video: Sanae learns the truth of the universe.<br/></p>\n<p>I haven't gone into detail of how Rumia and Sanae got into the world of Taikan. The Project where\u00a0Claude and Cyaegha are from, my excuse was that Cyaegha spread a deep darkness to that point\u00a0space warped and got Rumia and Sanae in the world of Taikan. I don't have a solid story for it\u00a0but I really wanted to make a script about the characters from the Taikan Project.</p>\n<p>The personalities of each character, especially the Taikan characters, might be wrong, so I apologize\u00a0for that, may it be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Darkness Over the Hill</p>\n<p>By Syoudre</p>\n<p>Discord: Syoudre#8210</p>\n<p>Story / Graphic Design - UI / Sound / Programming / Claude &amp; Cyaegha Portraits By Syoudre</p>\n<p>Most Sound Effects Ryannlib</p>\n<p>Dialogue code based from Sparen Naudiz</p>\n<p>Rumia / Sanae Portraits - Dairi</p>\n<p>Taikan Project - Rian</p>\n<p>Sprites: </p>\n<p>Claude Player Sprite, Cyaegha Boss Sprite, Fireball bullets - Syoudre</p>\n<p>Sanae Player Sprite - Fuzzbearplush</p>\n<p>Rumia Boss Sprite - Unknown Author.
