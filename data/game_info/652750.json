The map contains ancient writing that you are not able to read, however it seems that there are markings on the map that show a location in the middle of a forest. You decide to investigate what is at this location. This is where your adventure begins, you walk up to an <strong>ancient structure</strong> that seems as if it has been waiting for you....</p>\n<p>Go and explore the area and soon you will encounter <strong>strange pulsating eggs</strong>, however it is no small feat to reach them. By finding <strong>hidden objects</strong>, unlocking <strong>code switches</strong>, and well timed jumps you will be able to collect all of the eggs.\u00a0 \u00a0An <strong>altar</strong> is in the middle of the ancient structure where it seems the eggs can be placed. Are you able to discover the secrets of the ancient structure?</p>\n<p><strong>Roadmap:</strong><br/>The game is currently a protoype/demo.<br/>Only the starting area is made and you can complete the first part of the game.<br/>For the next areas I had the idea to add some additional mechanics for more intricate puzzles. However, currently I am planning to shift my priorities to new projects and thus do not plan to work on the other two areas. If this prototype gets some traction I might shift my priorities and continue with the other areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>E to interact with objects in the world<br/>WASD for movement<br/>Shift to sprint<br/>Spacebar to jump<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Find me at:</strong><br/>Youtube<br/>Discord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28e/28ea7411e3e43736768db9183f48bf7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheGoldenNPC"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
