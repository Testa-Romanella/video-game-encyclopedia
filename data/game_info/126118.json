Will he fulfill his destiny, or be consumed by frivolous desires? My money is on the latter, personally, but who's to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0In the end it doesn't really matter.</p>\n<p>I developed The Green Man as a way of getting ideas off my chest. It has a bunch of semi-formed weird experimental aspects in writing, art, and music. In my opinion many of these things are interesting, all I hope is you at least find them funny.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd3f5b0033034bc04350db37cbd9ea9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Suoly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
