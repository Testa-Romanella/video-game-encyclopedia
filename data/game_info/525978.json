I've just transferred to Mori Mori private academy from Tokyo, and thus far, everyone is kind enough... My name is Takashi Toono, I've been at this school for less than a day and I've regrettably already joined my first club. From what I\u2019ve heard, there\u2019s some interesting personalities inside. Yuri, loud and erratic. Akemi, small and intimidating. Itome, a quiet giant. Tamura, aggressive and pushy. Shikatani, distant and cold. As well as three others I\u2019ve heard being talked about; a fellow transfer student, a quiet and nervous boy, and some kind soccer player. Then there\u2019s me, a bland, everyday average student... Hopefully the photography club is easy enough, not like anything could go wrong... right?\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Play as Takashi Toono from the series Yarichin Bitch Club in this new fan game dating sim by Aesthetic Accidents Atelier!
