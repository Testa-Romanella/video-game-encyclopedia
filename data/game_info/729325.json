Its sequel, E.V.O.: Search for Eden, is perhaps better known to Western audiences, and the two share a similar concept, structure, and sense of humor. But this earlier game has a deeper and more involved plot, blending elements from the Earth\u2019s history with mythology, and speculating a bit into the future.</p>\n<p>The battles are quite simple - even slightly less complex than Dragon Quest. But by defeating creatures around you, you gain points you can distribute to four stats. By reaching a certain threshold, you can evolve into an entirely different creature that lived in that era. And this is pretty cool - the evolution tree grows quite expansive as you progress through the Earth\u2019s history.</p>\n<p>Recommended for fans of Search for Eden, fans of old-school RPGs, and dinosaur fans in general.</p>\n<p>Has a fan translation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/8957b03eef78fdbf7596fc7cd1c6d5e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Almanic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
