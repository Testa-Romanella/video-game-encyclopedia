What does that even mean? Well, it's heavily influenced by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, except instead of performing tricks on a skateboard, you're blowing stuff up...and a snail. There's rail sliding, spinning, combo-tallying, and tons of unique weapons.</p><p>Snail Storm wears its influences proudly on its sleeve (if it had a sleeve?). BulletStorm, THPS, SSX, and Jet Set Radio, Luftrausers, and DownWell, just to name a few. I tried mixing my favorite concepts of these games to create something unique. Still in early release, I'm listening to any and all comments about how to make this game better. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d059951b0bad8ffc75c1c21787d81f83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snarge"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
