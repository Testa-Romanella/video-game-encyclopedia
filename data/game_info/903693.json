Our attention has been focused on cooperation, instead of mindless growth. Humanity is scattered now, and entire continents worth of humans have had to reshuffle and organize themselves and their loved ones onto an old Earth, into old re-imagined cities, and new communities. The people of this age are tired of hunger, war, and disaster\u2014virtually everyone\u2019s efforts are directed toward the survival and nurturing of the remaining people on Earth. It\u2019s hard to be anything but cooperative during these times, in the wake of humanity seeing the devastating consequences of living detached from one another. Empathetic and compassionate communities have risen from the ashes--from the floods, from the wreckage of storms, earthquakes, and heat--of a chaotic planet. Technological advances, cooperation, and trauma bonding have pushed those left on Earth towards a path of rebuilding and healing the remains of a broken planet.<br/></p>\n<p>This game module operates under the Story Archive solo RPG system, and unless stated otherwise by module rules, use the information, mechanics, character/item generation, and rules from Story Archive when running a game module.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T13:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb2097d23b01da3c17a0dc6b2ca81610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunflower_wizard"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
