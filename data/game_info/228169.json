{"id": 228169, "slug": "gurk-ii-the-8-bit-rpg", "name": "Gurk II, the 8-bit RPG", "name_original": "Gurk II, the 8-bit RPG", "description": "The super-charged sequel to the famous 8-bit RPG, Gurk II is a huge new adventure with all of the most requested features added: quests, music, sound, potions, and an improved look! Fans of the original will be shedding tears of joy as they roll for their character's stats, board ships, summon monsters and cast powerful area of effect spells. Players not previously familiar with the realm of Gurk will simply stare in slack-jawed wonder at the beautifully pixelated graphics, all the while being serenaded by the lush and authentic MIDI soundtrack. Only the viscerally-compressed sound FX and challenging new combat tactics will snap them back to their senses. This game radiates a pure and unabashed joy of old-school RPGing; your $1 couldn't possibly go any further now, or back in 1986 when these kinds of games were actually commercially viable. Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T04:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f88dd9760ddd4713d5f9d49e68553c65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Larva Labs"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
