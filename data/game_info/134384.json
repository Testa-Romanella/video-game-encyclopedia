The game was developed in C# with XNA over 7 months by a small team. There are several modes of play available by default - the game starts with Arcade, Practice and Versus modes. Arcade mode is an infinite progression that gets progressively more difficult until the player's first loss. Practice and Versus mode are self-explanatory. Be sure to read the read me for more info. The game uses XNA, which requires the .net framework, as well as XNA's framework. The links can be found in the readme.
