You can build boats and deploy them and your friends will see them and be able to crew or captain them. Some functionality may be authorized only by the owner of the server depending on the effect.<h3>Chat</h3>The game includes a very basic low profile text based chat to allow for communication during multiplayer. It is intended primarily as a quick message relay and to aid players in connecting on Discord or Steam chat.<h3>Weather</h3>Physical weather systems (Rain, Storms, Fog, Wind, etc.) move around the map and can be monitored for your vessels safety on a journey. The further away from the protection of the islands the more intense the affect the weather will have on your vessel and the ocean waves around you.
