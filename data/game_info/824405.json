May he find peace of mind.</p>\n<p>This was made for\u00a0IGMC\u00a0Rebirth\u00a0and can be finished within an hour, as per contest rules.\u00a0The game definitely isn't perfect (especially since I stick to the default animations instead of using my own), but I'm happy with it. I've only been able to work on this game because I was stuck indoors for weeks because I caught Covid. I've spent most of my Covid time working on this and I'm kinda exhausted of it. Anyway, Covid is still here and serious, take care of yourselves y'all.</p>\n<p>If you like the vibes, check out Slimes, which has even worse vibes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T14:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/508/50878e7a413036f92c5b22452152b404.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scitydreamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
