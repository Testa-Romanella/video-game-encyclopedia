{"id": 315307, "slug": "shellshark", "name": "ShellShark!", "name_original": "ShellShark!", "description": "<p><em>After wasting a long day doing crappy work no one needs, the worst thing an old shark could imagine is coming back to a lonely home where no-one waits. People can do anything to escape the cruel reality: video games, casino, drugs. All those bad habits did not just happen for no reason. I\u2019m kinda lucky to have the most innocent one. Although, I still wonder what troubles it will lead me to\u2026<br/></em></p><p>Play a game of ShellShark! The rules are simple: all you need is a deck of cards and a bunch of shells (we used to use living molluscs). You have <em>creature cards</em> and <em>action cards</em>, should be easy to tell the difference once you see them. Creature cards have their characteristics (<em>power</em> and <em>health</em>) and some special abilities. Also you have 48 molluscs that denotes your HPs. You win when your opponent\u2019s health turns down to zero.</p><p>Shuffle your deck and take 4 cards from it.</p><p>In the beginning of the turn take a card from your deck. Now you can put one creature on a table (order matters, so choose wisely) <em>and/or</em> use one of your action cards. When you\u2019re done, just say \u201cpass\u201d (if no-one answers, try clicking \u201cend turn\u201d). Then comes the fight phase where your creatures beat each others\u2019 tails. Then comes the opponent\u2019s turn.</p><p>Knowing these rules should be enough to beat Bob. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:48:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/466306dc2a2dfd7fffef83a15b92198c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yngwarr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
