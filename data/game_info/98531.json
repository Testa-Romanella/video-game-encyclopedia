All we ask in return is that you follow us on Twitter and/or sign up for our mailing list so we can let you know when the final version is released. You may also like to check out the devlog.</p><p>And please, please, pretty please with a cherry on top let us have your feedback either via email, Twitter or the TIGsource forums as we can't improve the game without your help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17dac382ad7410cefde690f929d43729.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bitbulldotcom"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
