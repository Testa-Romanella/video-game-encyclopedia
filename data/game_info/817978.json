Let's start right away with this \"FaceWorldPro\" (*^_^*)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"FaceWorldPro\" is an application that only needs ordinary cameras and ordinary CPUs to perform facial expressions and motion capture to operate prefabricated or custom 3D avatars. Five-finger gesture recognition and half-body whole-body motion recognition that do not require motion capture equipment and depth cameras that only require ordinary cameras will also be developed soon. It has a wide range of application scenarios such as live broadcast, scenario animation, video and film creation, education, web conference, video chat, KTV, etc.<br/>\r\nCompared with similar software, it supports weak light sources, face shielding such as glasses or even masks, and solves the problem of obvious lag and jitter during motion capture. Five-finger gesture recognition, half-body and full-body motion capture only rely on ordinary cameras without additional professional equipment.<br/>\r\nNo need for joint callouts out of the box!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T04:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2fc67564d5a9a972c220eb49700cd90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wk"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["wk"], "esrb_rating": null}
