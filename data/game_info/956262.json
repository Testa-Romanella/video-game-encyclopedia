It's a game for people who like building, strategy, tactics and epic automated sci-fi battles.<h3>BUILD YOUR BASE</h3>Construct towers and drone factories to defend your ship from the horde. Make use of the environment - strategic placement matters. Develop your economy for future waves.<br/><br/><h3>FIGHT THE HORDE</h3>Deploy exotic weaponry and armies of drones to repel waves of mutated monsters. Guide swarms, flank siege monsters and battle challenging elites. <br/><br/><h3>EVOLVE TO PERFECTION</h3>Choose a powerful new ability or upgrade after every wave. Get strong enough to bag an Emperor-class Kaiju.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>On the Acid Planet (formerly known as Earth), human beings have sadly become extinct. Under the toxic clouds, hordes of rampaging bio-monsters run wild and have grown to colossal size. <br/><br/>As a SCAV Corporation clone, you will conduct salvage operations from our orbital station. Be aware of monster activity on the surface. Your top priority is the capture of the Kaiju core. You won't be coming back without one. Good luck!<h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li>Action Tower-Defense gameplay with RTS and Roguelike elements<br/></li><li>Defend against massive swarms of monsters and gigantic Kaiju<br/></li><li>Control your hero and command armies of drones in real-time<br/></li><li>Huge variety of synergetic towers, drones, perks, crew-members and upgrades<br/></li><li>Innovative Research and Building systems<br/></li><li>Relaxing, strategic, satisfying horde-slaughter<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack by Cletus Lupus<br/></li><li>Early access version currently has 3/7 total Kaiju hunting missions <br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T15:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc765830339d72b071fc9dc32cf7174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web", "macOS"], "developers": ["Adam Travers", "sadab_towsif"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Adam Travers"], "esrb_rating": null}
