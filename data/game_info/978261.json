Work your way around the island\u2019s six neighbourhoods \u2013 from the rust buckets of Betty\u2019s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay \u2013 challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock.<br/><br/><br/>No two games are the same as you work your way through 40 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination.<br/><br/><br/>Octane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team\u2019s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play.<br/><br/><br/>Just about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Manic arcade action</li></ul><ul><li>40 levels</li></ul><ul><li>Six unique neighbourhoods</li></ul><ul><li>Local and online couch co-op</li></ul><ul><li>Local and online versus mode</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T12:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a435308aecbe6b6cdac02feacccc0b39.jpg", "website": "http://manicmechanics.game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4J Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["4J Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
