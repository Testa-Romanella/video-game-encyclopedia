{"id": 210688, "slug": "codename-galactus", "name": "Codename: Galactus", "name_original": "Codename: Galactus", "description": "<p>Galactus is a concept prototype where you are digging through a planet's layers while dodging and destroying dense rocks in order to reach its core. The object is to maintain a fast enough speed where you can tear through the core causing the planets imminent destruction while you're trying to escape through the other side.</p>\n<p>We wanted to test out a digging mechanic where we tracked the paths of your previous runs, allowing for a less resistant path if you stuck to those trails. We also added in a quick loadout system where you could hold a few power-ups to aid you in your digging.</p>\n<p>We ultimately got lost in how we wanted to play this game, so we decided to shelve it for now. We'd love to hear your feedback on its current state.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move Left - Left Arrow<br/>\r\nMove Right - Right Arrow<br/>\r\nUse Next\u00a0Item - Up Arrow<br/>\r\nExit Game - ESC<br/>\r\nToggle Fullscreen - F11</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a886269fd37876c03e3f01c031ee3a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curiosity Motive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
