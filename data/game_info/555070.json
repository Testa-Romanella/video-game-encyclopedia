Unlike other action games you fight using your mouse rather than simply pushing buttons, you can get really creative with it. Game mechanics are easy to grasp but difficult to master. Levels are generated by randomly placing premade rooms so every run is different. There are many unlockable items and weapons. Game difficulty is growing with each level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc1b36767eb2b6dec75ff6061c8230e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["UndergroundGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
