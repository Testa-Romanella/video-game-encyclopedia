{"id": 108495, "slug": "tower-of-freedom", "name": "Tower of Freedom", "name_original": "Tower of Freedom", "description": "<p>\r\n\tGrab the right tools and resources, and build your tower to the portal!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tChop trees and break stones to gather resources to build your tower. However, beware of monsters trying to tear you and your tower apart! Balance constructing and resource gathering with killing those sneaky monsters, and you will succeed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(And go into the history books as the Greatest Builder of Towers that ever existed. I know you want it.)\r\n</p>\r\nWhat's inside?!\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere's an interactive tutorial to learn the game, a single player mode, and even a local multiplayer mode! (No online multiplayer because, frankly, I don't have the money. Besides, it's much more fun to play together with friends <em>in real life</em>.)\r\n</p>\n<p>For those interested in the specifics, here's the facts:</p>\n<ul><li>Six tools to choose from</li><li>Three resources to gather</li><li>Four monsters to battle</li><li>Two modes to play (day and night)</li><li>Ten difficulty levels, and ten map sizes</li><li>Nine items to buy in the shop (during a game)</li></ul>\r\nWhat else can I expect?\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe game's finished, but could be expanded or improved upon, of course. If you have a request, be sure to tell me and I will see what I can do. Similarly, if you find a bug or disagree with something in the game, let me know and I will try to solve it.</p>\n<p>I also intend to put the source code and everything on GitHub, so people can use it or learn from it. However, because that wasn't my intention at first, I will need to scour the game files for any private/weird comments or files :p</p>\r\nWhy itch.io?\r\n<p>I am an indie developer with no funding, making games because I love doing so, and want to become better and better. Sadly, the huge stores (such as Steam) require a large upfront payment, and lots of \"marketing\" to get approved, which isn't possible for me. So, I hope to bring the game to as wide an audience as possible using the awesome free services of this website!</p>\r\nWhy free?\r\n<p>At first I <em>did</em> want to release this game for a very low price, because a lot of time and effort went into it. But then I thought \"why would I\", \u00a0because the game is way too small to make any real money, and I don't need the money. Furthermore,\u00a0I'm strongly against advertisments or shady schemes to get money from people, so here I'm just releasing this hoping people will enjoy it.</p>\n<p>(Also, it started as a silly project to learn a new game engine, and it doesn't feel right to ask money for a first try gone wrong.)</p>\r\nWhich platforms are supported?\r\n<p>Any 64-bit Windows, Mac or Linux system. If you really need a 32-bit version, tell me, and I'll see what I can do. As of right now, though, there are some mysterious issues with my engine that prevent this.</p>\n<p>The game was made with the Godot game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbd/cbd9417ce46935d6324af78bf18ed3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
