The revolutionary 3-screen cabinet, in-seat bass speakers and iconic cast of colourful, aquatic-lifeform-themed boss characters, together with the now legendary soundtrack established its place in game fan's hearts. Other features carried over included the branching stage maps and power up system.<br/><br/><strong>Darius (Arcade, new version, 1987)</strong><br/>A difficulty-balanced version of the previous release making boss battle easier the more powerups you have.<br/><br/><strong>Darius (Arcade, extra version, 1987)</strong><br/>Further difficulty balances along with all new enemy placement makes for an easier game which gets much more difficult at the end.<h3>DARIUS II</h3><strong>Darius II (Arcade, Dual Screen version, 1989)</strong><br/>A dual screen sequel to 1987's original game, with new bosses, new weaponry, the ability to switch directions during boss battles and... TUNA SASIMI!<h3>SAGAIA</h3>SAGAIA (Arcade, ver.1, 1989)<br/>Darius II was redesigned for the international market with shorter stages and less bosses with less health, but higher overall difficulty to balance the changes out. As a result, some routes and bosses were removed completely.<br/><br/>SAGAIA (Arcade, ver.2, 1989)<br/>Conceptually the same as version 1, but with various changes, this second version is shrouded in mystery and it's unknown whether it was ever available to play at the time.<h3>Darius Gaiden</h3>Darius Gaiden (Arcade, 1994)<br/>The first Darius game available on a single screen, this allowed it to be installed in more arcades than its predecessors. Spectacular visuals with semi-transparent effects, parallax scrolling and breath-taking boss entrance scenes, the visuals are only surpassed by the difficulty! New to the series is the ability to capture and use mid-bosses, as well as the black hole bomb!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T04:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7f8c834dd9b79b76c6485e4c3e65bd2.jpg", "website": "https://darius.jp/cozmic/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 119, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Taito", "M2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Taito", "ININ Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
