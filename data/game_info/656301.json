There is an editor for placing entities and movement patterns but it's not enabled in the public release build, I might enable it in the future when I feel it's more stable and user friendly.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The current state of the game is ~6ish levels and then you get a brief end screen with tallied score. More levels will be added, and the ones that are in currently will probably get reworked to some degree.<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to give it a spin, feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>Right now it's only available for windows - but it should be buildable on linux with some minor tweaks, something I will look into.<br/></p>\n\r\nCurrent key bindings:\r\n<p>X - Shoot, Arrows to move.</p>\n<p>I use a PS4 controller via usb to play, deadzone and buttons are configurable, but I haven't tried any other controllers yet so results may vary.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/24567183eb645b63fba7497c132bbbf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lightsoda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
