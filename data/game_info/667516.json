First, you must find the key, then the house, and open the house with the key.<br/></p>\n<p>But, there is a Moai statue following you around. Moai will follow you around when you do not expect it, making a distinct sound that can be heard over the sounds of the gloomy night every time he creeps by closer.</p>\n<p>After some time, Moai will enter rage mode, wherein he will move a lot faster than he usually does. On top of that, Moai will move faster the closer he is to you.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - movement</li><li>SPACEBAR - jump</li><li>CTRL/SHIFT - sprint/slow down respectively</li><li>F - interact</li><li>F11 - toggle fullscreen</li></ul>\r\nSystem requirements:\r\n<p>This game requires ~128 MB of RAM on default settings (messing with resolution scaling/MSAA can change this number).<br/></p>\n<p>Most CPUs from at least 2010 should be able to run this, and most GPUs from at least 2010 should too. For the specifics, this requires (at least) OpenGL 3.3. Support for other rendering APIs (like Vulkan) may come in a later version of my game engine.</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing frame drops related to GPU usage, you should turn on performance mode in settings, as this may greatly reduce the GPU usage, particularly in older systems. (if it is unavailable this means that it is force-locked to enabled due to limitations of your hardware)</p>\r\nMore information:\r\n<p>The game takes inspiration from a DOOM .WAD by the name of\u00a0do_not_play.wad, and\u00a0it also takes a little inspiration from the movement in Source engine games.</p>\n<p>Note that this game was originally made as more of a tech demo of my game engine's sound system, but if this idea gets enough traction I may update this, or even remake it while keeping the base concept intact (most likely spicing up the gameplay as well)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:07:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f4/7f42026a33d544a6718606325fb613aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vetra"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
