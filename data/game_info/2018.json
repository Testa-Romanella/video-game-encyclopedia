{"id": 2018, "slug": "cthulhu-saves-the-world", "name": "Cthulhu Saves the World", "name_original": "Cthulhu Saves the World", "description": "<p>Cthulhu Saves The World is a parody RPG where you take on the role of Cthulhu, the lord of darkness who is meant to destroy the world. His powers were blocked by a magician, and now he needs to become a true hero to restore them and fulfill his mission. Inspired by Howard P. Lovecraft\u2019s novels, the game turns the classic plot into a humorous story with multiple cultural references.</p>\n<p>The game looks like a top-down old-school RPG with permanent fourth-wall breaking and numerous quests you can complete. Visually it uses pixel-art and pseudo-3D elements. During the game you meet different characters that join your party. Each of them has different attack types you can upgrade. These attacks are also unique; so, Cthulhu has the ability to make enemies insane.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is focused on exploration, turn-based random fights and boss battles. There are nine dungeons you need to sweep, full of multiple monsters. You can unblock more game modes progressing through the game.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2011-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-28T12:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca548ad61d376aec77acbb03c774a98.jpeg", "website": "http://zeboyd.com/2010/06/11/cthulhu-saves-the-world-press-release/", "rating": 2.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 101, "owned": 1657, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 54, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 84, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 85, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zeboyd Games", "TinkerHouse Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zeboyd Games", "TinkerHouse"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
