You're\u00a0adorable.\r\nYou've got this little unicorn horn, and you are making it <em>work</em>.<br/>\u00a0\r\nOne fateful\u00a0day, you have the idea to throw\u00a0a tea party for a friend, but uhhhhhhh, welllll, there's one teeny tiny problem... you're out of tea. Whoops.<br/>\u00a0\r\nIn the desolate wastes of your home planet, tea is a bit hard to come by, but after greasing a few hands -\u00a0quite literally - you've navigated through the mountains to a secluded valley in which\u00a0tea leaves float gracefully\u00a0through the wind.\r\nWhat a splendidly\u00a0convenient turn of events!<br/>\u00a0\r\nYour mission - should you choose to accept it - is to gather enough tea leaves to save the tea party and show your friend how special they are!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game is being developed by\u00a0Aidan Walsh, a game designer, tech artist, and all-around artsy fartsy type living in sunny Chicago, trying to make silly little games that bring some small measure of\u00a0joy into the world.\r\n\r\nOther Contributors:<br/><br/>The soundtrack of Tea for Two is Trois Gymnop\u00e9dies by 19th Century French Composer\u00a0Erik Satie, it's a beautiful piece and I highly recommend checking out his work!<br/><br/>I owe much of the fluid motion and elegance\u00a0of this game to a modified version of the Klak motion library by\u00a0Keijiro Takahashi, there's not a doubt in my mind that he's\u00a0an actual wizard.<br/><br/>The original snail model can be found here, and the rocks in the environment are from the Unity Tanks! Tutorial, if you're new to game development and want to check out a thorough introductory example, it's great stuff.\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n***Small but personally significant update***\r\nTea for Two got some lovely\u00a0coverage\u00a0by Jay Castello, a\u00a0writer over at Cliqist!<br/>The blurb that\u00a0makes me get all flustered and weepy is this:\r\n<em>\"Everything the game is utterly charming, from the trail that you leave behind to the truck-style beeping that plays if you move backwards. A colourful, smile-inducing moment of serenity.\"</em>\r\nEven the smallest bit of praise I've gotten for this game, whether from friends or game journalists, serves as yet another reminder of why making games is so important to me. If someone created a thing that made your day, let them know! There's a good chance it'll make their whole week.\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>W / S - move forward or back</li><li>A / D - turn left or right</li><li>Escape - quit the game</li><li>The rest is optional, figure it out! Explore the keyboard a bit!</li></ul>\r\n\u00a0\r\n(To all you\u00a0Mac users out there, I will have a build available\u00a0for you at the soonest possible time!
