Players help foster new life and promote its evolution into \n      life-forms of higher intelligence. Guide civilization along the path of \n      evolution until it can achieve Exodus, the ultimate goal of settling on \n      another planet. The basic challenge of the game is to maintain a \n      comfortable environment for the life-forms by adjusting atmospheric and \n      geological parameters. Small organisms called Prokaryote and Trichordate \n      will grow and evolve into a multitude of life-forms. Making a drastic \n      change is a recipe for disaster. The key to success is to make small \n      adjustments and watch how the life-forms react. SimEarth also includes \n      planets with environments different from Earth, such as Mars and Venus. \n      Try your hand at terraforming these planets with harsh conditions into a \n      world where life can thrive.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
