The recipe you'll need to acheive fun!\r\nIn the game's actual development state, it has 18 diferent \"Towers\" ( the penguins by itself and their deadly machines used to obliterate slimes ), 8 Tracks in 4 different modes, including one \"nearly impossible track\". Various waves and kinds of slimes that will require great defenses.\r\n( I don't know how to make the OST for the game or had the money to pay a producer. The tracks used for this game are from Himiko Kuchi's Flying Beagle album. That's why this game isn't monetized, but I'll keep up on the updates and bug fixing!\u00a0So please, if you find any bug that is ruining the game, let us know in the comments!\u00a0)\r\n<strong>an actual footage of the game '0'</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T12:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/00244e2b022387ed1b4b2dcd08391423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Chibas_Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
