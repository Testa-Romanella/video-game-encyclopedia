Your goal is to defeat it with your guns!\u00a0Collect Gun Modules when they drop to switch to another weapon (They heal you too!). But be careful, as the boss is not alone. He will summon mini slimes to attack you! Killing enough slimes will grant you a damage and score multiplier which makes you more powerful but they will also leave behind a sticky mess which will slow you down if you step on it. And killing the turquoise slimes will drop Gun Modules. Your damage will fall off the further you are from your enemies, so go close to them to finish them off faster!</p>\n<p>A surprise awaits you once you've damaged the boss enough...</p><p>Made in a team of 3<br/>Seetoh Wei Tung, Quek Jing Hui,\u00a0Joyce Toh Lay Xuan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efe4a2d4a492aa108333a6e4b39aebc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
