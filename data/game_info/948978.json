I have a grand vision for this title but also am using it as a basis to understand the RM tools. I'm using original RM assets and because of how early of a build there is a lot of unfinished/buggy content. I would love to hear from the community on what's working and what isn't. There are also a couple items easily found in the game that won't be in the final build but are there for testing purposes, Shadowstep Scroll, and Zevin's Visor. Please explore and enjoy what is currently available.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47f0204df4b2d64554c69fb8b779b7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zevin83"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
