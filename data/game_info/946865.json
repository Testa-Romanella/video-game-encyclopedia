Includes\u00a0\u00a0<strong>one image with visible blood\u00a0</strong>and,\u00a0depending on the ending you get, can include\u00a0<strong>brief\u00a0written descriptions of gore/violence</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is one half of my thesis project taking a look at animations and visual novels as tools for storytelling. The other half is an animatic created with the same story and setting, which can be watched on Youtube:\u00a0The Story of Sanelma - ANIMATIC</p>\n<p>If you'd like to partake in the study, you can find the form related to that here:\u00a0Thesis Survey - Animation and Visual Novels</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: Web version is a bit broken.</strong>\u00a0It's somewhat functional on Firefox, but\u00a0only plays on Chrome if the developer tools are open for some reason. Also one bad ending is unattainable in the web version.\u00a0You can download the game for a better experience :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T06:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b9112d1c23406a2da529e175037633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kartsuli"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
