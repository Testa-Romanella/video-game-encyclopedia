The object of the game is for the player to guide the zombie horde and attempt to wipe out (turn into zombies) a majority of the humans.</p><p><strong>Meteorite fragments</strong> can be collected by the horde to increase their speed and strength (resistance to damage). Bonuses add up but there aren't enough meteorites to max both speed and strength.</p><p><strong>Rivers can be crossed by zombies</strong> at any point but they can't swim and will be swept down stream. <strong>Seek out shallow crossings</strong> for the most control when fording rivers.</p><p><strong>At night, humans are at a disadvantage with limited visibility.</strong> During the day, humans actively hunt zombies and have much greater range and accuracy. <strong>Zombies can seek shelter in dense forests</strong> to make it more difficult for humans to detect and shoot them. <strong>Zombies are very vulnerable in the day time.</strong> <strong>Watch the clock</strong> carefully and <strong>avoid open spaces.</strong></p><p>The game has been tested in Chrome and Firefox.</p><p>Design, art, programming John Watson</p><p>Entered in #proceduraldeathjam and #7drl 2014</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6cdcf80a73d2b9f63ab74afe4d4660d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Watson"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
