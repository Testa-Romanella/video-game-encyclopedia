The brief was to make an exact clone of an existing game, add your own twists while maintaining the essence of the main game. We were given 4 weeks and scoping down our ambitions was highly emphasized. The goal of the task was to get working with and in a team, learning the efficiency of version control and get accustomed to Unity. This popular Google Chrome game is iconic and its essence is in its simplicity of the mechanics and control. We added a narrative to it. The narrative of evolution. It is not a step by step scientific evolution process but rather quick successions of important milestones, focused on fun and eventual future. It was an enriching experience and certainly taught me the basics of efficient game development.\u00a0Made in collaboration with Tomi Panula and Kai Hanninen. Play on Windows for optimum experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e9c32b727e7b45daee2f0658be90a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ABHISHEK"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
