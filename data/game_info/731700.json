In an attempt to break this mold, Frontlaners' difficulty is\u00a0tied directly to the decision-making behavior of the AI; no extra resources or\u00a0hidden income, no scripted sequences or advantageous starts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a790747c96d193f4d09d05002d027f83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SurfaceToAsh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
