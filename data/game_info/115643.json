Watch out! If you use the wrong color, you lose Ammo that you wont get back!\u00a0 Your Goal is your Time. This means, the longer you survive, the higher your score gets.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move Around</li><li>2xW - Sprint</li><li>RMB - Change Color</li><li>LMB - Shoot</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Who worked on it ?</strong></p>\n<p>I worked on this Project mainly myself. I nevertheless got some help by some people which I want to thank here :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ricardo\u00a0Parise</strong> - Modeling some Assets</li><li><strong>Tim\u00a0Lapp</strong> - Programming\u00a0Support</li><li><strong>SAE Cologne Stuff</strong> - Helping me with some Blueprinting Problems</li><li><strong>ALXDMusic </strong>- Ingame Music</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Will this be continued?</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created as an assignement for University. After the assignement I decided that I wanted to continue the game so that it is actually playable. That is the state the game is at right now, so I put it on hold for now.\u00a0I have some Ideas on what I could add to the game, but I am not sure if it is worth it. This is why I uploaded the game to this side, so that people can test it and give feedback.<br/></p>\n<p>So feel free to give any Feedback that could make this game better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef51bc4e6339ca551b672ecc11a621e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PMike"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
