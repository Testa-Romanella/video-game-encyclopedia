Its combat takes inspiration from Japanese arcade shooters, but the story and world are structured like an action-RPG. Bosses will put your skills to the test, but you'll only have to defeat each one once.<br/><br/>In Vacant Kingdom you explore a whimsical yet desolate land and try to uncover the mystery of where its inhabitants went. On the way you'll meet a colourful cast of characters. Like a chef who only knows one recipe, a nefarious wizard who wields the dark power of obtuse riddles, and a robot who is programmed to teach the world about insects.Why \"Prologue\"?<strong>Prologue for a Vacant Kingdom</strong> is a slice of a larger game which will eventually be released as <strong>Farewell for a Vacant Kingdom</strong>. You can think of it as a demo designed to gather feedback so that the final game can be as great as possible. However, even though Prologue is a demo, it does contain a lot of content. Most players can expect to spend 2-3 hours completing it.Key Gamer Features<ul><li>Challenging bullet hell gameplay in a unique action-RPG framework.<br/></li><li>Three levels of difficulty to suit beginners and veterans alike.<br/></li><li>Explore a haunted resort and uncover its secrets.<br/></li><li>Meet a cast of quirky characters.<br/></li><li>Created all by one person.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/290cec4a494464ea7713c36f57e2a095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shru"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["shru"], "esrb_rating": null}
