You will have other helicopters helping you drop water. They will always move toward you so by moving your mouse around you can guide them to where it is most helpful in stopping the fire. When you beat a level you will advance to the next one. There is no game save feature at this time.\u00a0</p><p>Game is still in development and with your support I can add more levels and improve on game play aspects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf6c9fd91de444260c33fb6db0baa665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Below Zero Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
