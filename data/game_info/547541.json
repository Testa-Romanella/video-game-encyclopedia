Just a few simple math problems to ease your mind into the shallows of slumber. But this cursed puzzle keeps giving you numbers for blocks you haven't solved yet. And your friend's score keeps climbing, while yours has stumbled backwards thanks to that wayward misplaced digit from a minute ago. Why did you agree to a base-16 challenge?

But if you're right, <em>ah</em>, if you're right, then you cannot wait to see the look on your friend's face in the morning, the grimaced annoyance at your snatching away their sure victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>\n<p>You exhale the breath you didn't know you were holding, and <em>click</em>. . .</p>\n<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>\n<p>Modulo is a puzzle game based on modular arithmetic, where you must not only deduce the modular difference between blocks but strategically place your answers to net the highest scores possible.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>EASY TO LEARN, HARD TO MASTER</strong><br/>With support for everything from gentle 5-digit decimal-based puzzles to exotic base-64 one hundred digit marathons, you can find the challenge perfect for you.
