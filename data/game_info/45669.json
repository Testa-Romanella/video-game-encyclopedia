Go city witch, fly between rooftops to light the ancient runes of power. Light them to complete the ritual and set the glitches free.<br/><br/>Beware! Glitches take on many forms. They haunt the rooftops as traps, spooks, and dark things that skitter. Scaredy cats will block your path and fearsome beasts will face you. Learn their movements to outwit them, and you'll progress to new cities with new challenges.<br/><br/>Cityglitch is a game of small, bite-sized puzzles. Take turns moving around the board as glitches move and react to you. If a glitch catches you it will restart the level, but don't worry, with each attempt you'll learn more clues to complete it.
