While a living fox, Kelpie can jump, run, and bounce on enemies. Once dead, she becomes a flying ghost, able to go through certain types of objects, grab certain types of items, and fend off phantasms that haunt her!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>- WASD + Mouse (Left Click = jump / confirm)</p>\n<p>- Arrow Keys + SpaceBar</p>\n<p>- Or play with a\u00a0Controller!\u00a0</p>\r\nExtra Information:\r\n<ul><li>All songs are creations of mine and made during the time of the jam (with FL Studio 21), as well as all the artwork (with Aseprite, Spritemancer, and Pixels Composer).
