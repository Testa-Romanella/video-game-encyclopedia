In this game you'll have to train an AI to drive a spaceship. The goal is to have an AI capable of finishing any race without hiting the track borders and as quickly as possible. To train your AI you'll have to design tracks and find the best training parameters and methods.</p>\n<p>Once your AI is trained you can save it and use it in the campaign mode to see if it is able to beat the campaign AI. You can also make it race versus AI trained by other player to see who have the best one.</p>\n<p>Everything has been made by me (except the font) which partially explain the quality of musics and graphics.</p>\n\n<p>Contact: malkins0n.games@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c3466ca06bb27608d84f2b46278a00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["malkins0n"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
