The images you see were mosaicked outside the game.]<br />\nIn 2077, a professor specializing in genetics succeeded in replicating 90% of human DNA and thus opened up the possibility of human cloning.<br />\nMany saw it as a great breakthrough in the medical field, which led to the creation of the very first clone generator.<br />\nSome countries, however, have begun to fear the possibility of mass production of clone soldiers, which could tip the balance of power.<br />\nAnd so began a war to control the clone generator. The founding professor of cloning technology died in the aftermath and left his assistant as the only person on earth capable of running the generator.<br />\nInstead of following his mentor&#39;s will, unfortunately, the assistant used the generator to mass-produce clone troopers, took over the world and began calling himself Psychotal.<br />\n5 years later, 2 rebels have launched their plan to stop Psychotal&#39;s reign and restore peace once again.<br />\nIn this action-platformer game, help Talia achieve her goal.
