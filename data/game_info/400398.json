This project is about as old as Undertale (of course a bit younger. Like several months younger), I'm glad I finally did something finished (well, sort of finished).</p>\n<p>I honestly don't know if I'll make the full game because quite frankly I'm tired of it &lt;) But I'll try. But maybe I'll make some other game in the meantime, I have a couple of game ideas and one of them is even feasible\u00a0&lt;)</p>\n<p>btw, if you find bugs - tell me in the comments. I tried to find every bug\u00a0but you can never be sure you got everything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-23T02:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47e0294b0394b80b4743be129f7f6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shmazman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
