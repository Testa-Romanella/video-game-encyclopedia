It serves as a prequel to Phoenix Rising and completes the story. Some of  the features that I completely implemented on my own are:\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<ol><li><strong>Creative Changes:\u00a0</strong><ol><li>Wrote, created and  implemented the entire narrative for the game. This includes the custom  storyboards that the player will find as he/she progresses through the game. \r\n</li><li>Implemented custom 2D lighting to two levels in the game, creating a completely different atmosphere for the final two levels.</li></ol>\n</li><li><strong>Gameplay Changes:</strong><ol><li>Updated health and damage settings for both the player and enemies\r\n</li><li>Created a new flying enemy with it's own animations and behaviours. </li><li>Created patrolling enemies which take in a series of waypoints and continuously patrol an area.</li><li>Modified existing scripts to suit the narrative of the game and  wrote a new FullHealthPickup Script to create a new pickup for the  player. <br/>\n</li><li>Increased damage to Acid pools to ensure Player death on contact. \r\n</li><li>Added a custom Space backdrop to all the levels for a better aesthetic. </li></ol>\n</li><li><strong>UI Changes:</strong>\u00a0<ol><li>Reworked all the menus, changed the font and added an instruction page on all levels.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Created a \"Retry Level\" Button on all levels.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Updated the UI on all levels to now display the objective on the top right of the screen\r\n</li><li>The level name is now displayed on top of the screen along with health and lives being shown on the top left.\u00a0</li></ol>\n</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits:\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Game designed and developed by: Janmejay Chakravarty \r\n</li><li>A special thanks to <strong>Brackeys</strong>,  they have amazing tutorials related to Unity on YouTube and helped  solve several programming issues I encountered while making the game. \r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is my second game as a developer and I've tried to create a rising difficulty curve across the levels as well as bring in some tension by clouding the narrative through the first few levels of the game. This game has seen a lot of iteration and experimentation, both in mechanics and narrative, so I really hope you enjoy the final experience of The Antagonist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a novice game developer I would really appreciate all the feedback I can get. Please do drop a comment on how you think I could have improved the  game, what the game did well, what could've been changed and I'll surely keep it in mind for my future projects. Thank you  for playing, I hope you had a good time with The Antagonist and enjoyed  the experience. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/3127a99d7e8f5086e51123d93d10228a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Janmejay Chakravarty"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
