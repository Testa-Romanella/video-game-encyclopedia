{"id": 393917, "slug": "into-my-arms", "name": "Into My Arms", "name_original": "Into My Arms", "description": "<p><strong>Into My Arms</strong> is a puzzle game where you control two players (\"cubitos\"). It can be played single player, but also with two players (each controlling a single cubito, of course)</p>\n<p>There are three rules:</p>\n<ul><li>The two cubitos may never see each other</li><li>The two cubitos may never move simultaneously</li><li>To win each level, one of them must step backwards from a height (of at least one tile) and fall into the arms of the cubito standing on the ground.</li></ul>\n<p>Of course, new mechanics are regularly introduced throughout the levels. But those are the three basic rules.</p>\n<p>The game has <strong>13 levels</strong> and is playable on any desktop system (Windows/Mac/Linux) and Android.</p>\n<p>The title of the game is taken from the beautiful song <strong>Into My Arms</strong> by <strong>Nick Cave</strong>. (Go listen to it now! Now!)<br/></p>\n<p>The source code for this game can be found here: https://github.com/Pandaqi/Into-My-Arms<br/></p>\n\r\nGitHub Game Off\r\n<p>\r\nThis is my entry for the <strong>GitHub Game Off Jam 2019</strong>.</p>\n<p>The theme was <strong>leaps and bounds</strong>. I interpreted that as \"taking a leap of faith\" and \"movement is bounded by the line of sight of the other player\"</p>\n<p>I had hoped to take the theme and story much further, like attaching players to objects with ropes\u00a0 that the other player would have to cut. But alas, time is short!</p>\n<p>I had also hoped to use more of the themes/imagery in the song <em>Into My Arms</em> (which inspired this game). For example, the song speaks of candles and angels guiding your path - light could surely become an interesting (and visually beautiful) mechanic in such a game.<br/></p>\n<p>As such, I am seriously considering to continue development once the game jam is over. If you'd like to see this game get a full release (with more levels, more polish, and a better story), please let me know!</p><p>(Until the deadline of the jam, I will also be polishing and updating the game. During the rating period, of course, I'll temporarily stop doing that.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:42:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20772cd2dd05148ed842a6ebafea3a26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
