You have been marked as the Terror's next prey, and the only way you will survive this night is to use the light of your torchstone to ward off the evil, all while searching for three mysterious stones to provide to the altar. Find the stones and the mark placed upon you will be gone, you will be free of the curse. But beware: should your light fade for too long, you WILL fall victim to the Terror.</p><p>WASD movement, Shift to run, Space to jump, Left-click to interact.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was created over the course of a week. Originally it was intended for Krassjam #7, but I ended up spending some extra time adding more features to it and improving the UI since I missed the deadline due to technical problems. I did all of the code and artwork, the music and sounds came from an asset found in the Unity asset store. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d80bec9a3f29afa4b179a4d47168a25a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheCwazyWabbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
