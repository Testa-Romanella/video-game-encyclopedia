{"id": 294128, "slug": "suzerain", "name": "Suzerain", "name_original": "Suzerain", "description": "<p>Suzerain is a text-based narrative role-playing game focused on politics. It takes place in an alternate reality set in the 1950s with unique countries, cultures and characters. In this interactive world, the player is on a journey where they can express themselves politically, morally or pragmatically as the President of Sordland, as well as a father and husband.</p>\n<p>The artistic aim and philosophy of the game is to put the player in the shoes of being a political leader at the personal level, delving extensively into power relationships, hard choices and real consequences. We strive to answer a few questions regarding the complexities of politics and raise even more questions about the driving force behind certain behaviours.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we set out to create a realistic and engaging story which is conveyed through the interactive and multi-conversant capable conversation system. This core element is further supported by other story or game mechanics such as factions, budget, constructions, countries, news, situations and policies which influence and/or react to player choice.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the game expands on other serious complex topics such as security, economics, freedoms and many more while allowing the player to reflect their own views by steering them. The powerful role of being the president enables expression in the form of decisions that shape the country along with its citizens in different ways. There is no right or wrong, only actions and sensible reactions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T01:39:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/09627345aa95f0636ea89d326e6ea17c.jpg", "website": "https://www.suzeraingame.com/", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 38, "owned": 640, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 33, "dropped": 5, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 89, "ratings_count": 24, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Torpor Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fellow Traveller", "Torpor Games UG"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
