The motivation to create long interconnected pipe systems through the falling pipe-tetrominoes is driven by the special 'ball' object that you get to choose where to place and roll through the pipe systems that have been placed. The more pipes that the ball is able to come in contact with, the more points you will earn!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32c0f0f83000e41f46f6653fe91452b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tech-Nostalgic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
