{"id": 422670, "slug": "criminal-consequences", "name": "Criminal Consequences", "name_original": "Criminal Consequences", "description": "What if Detective Games actually let the player be the Detective?\r\n<p>Most detective games don't actually let the player be Sherlock Holmes. Instead, the game is Sherlock, and the player is confined to the role of Watson, while the game tries desperately to persuade players that they're smart because\u00a0<strong><em>LOOK AT ALL THE\u00a0PROBLEMS THE GAME HAS\u00a0SOLVED FOR YOU!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Listen, nobody is fooled by these games' attempts at making the player feel smart by dangling bananas in front of monkeys (the players are monkeys in this analogy). Isn't it time someone actually\u00a0<strong><em>MADE</em>\u00a0</strong>a\u00a0<strong><em>DETECTIVE</em></strong> game?</p>\r\nCriminal Consequences is NOT a normal Detective game.\r\n<p>Alright. Here's the straight pitch. Criminal Consequences is a\u00a0<em><strong>REAL\u00a0</strong></em>detective game. No hand holding, no crazy coincidences, no brute forcing,\u00a0no going to mother game and crying until she lets you solve the mystery. There is a game. There is a mystery. There is logical induction and logical\u00a0deduction.\u00a0There are clues, witnesses, and suspects. There IS a solution to the madness...</p>\n<p>But<strong> </strong>only\u00a0<strong><em>YOU</em>\u00a0</strong>can solve the mystery.</p>\n<p>And if you mess up, the murderer escapes and an innocent person goes to jail.\u00a0<strong><em>AND YOU WILL BE NONE THE WISER.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It's that simple.</p>\r\nEstimated play time: 15-30 minutes.\r\nAn Experimental Game\r\n<p>This game was created in a short period of time by a team of three for a game jam. As a result, the game is... a little rough around the edges. This game is somewhat of an experiment to see if a fun experience can be created out of making a realistic detective game. This game should be seen, therefore, as\u00a0<strong><em>experimental</em></strong> - an experience that's short, to the point, and that will either pioneer the genre, or get promptly buried in the giant list of games on itch.io. Probably the latter.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this small project gives someone inspiration to build up to a full hands-off detective experience that will test player's abilities at critical thinking and bringing the evidence together.</p>\r\nStay Safe Game Jam\r\n<p>This game was made for the Stay Safe Game Jam, which arose to give people like myself something to do during the Covid-19 outbreak. And while I can confirm my room is still too small, at least I have enough space for a computer to code with. In accordance with the theme of the jam, all collaboration was done remotely through sketchy websites like Discord and Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my graphics guy, Big Tony (most famous for his cameo here), and my sound guy, DJ Sawyer (stream here), for helping to bring this thing together.</p>\n<p>This has been programming lead Sarcastic Scott, signing off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b9/7b94671dc08e893ecb6cf5d3473a6230.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ScusX Programming"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
