This game serves to illustrate this experience while reminding that us that we need each other.</p>\n<p>The theme of \"Stronger Together\" is brought to life by you, a volunteer, helping people who are isolating to get their weekly shop - while in return they help you by making you faster or giving you more time. We really wanted to show how dependent we are on one another.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move, press F11 to fullscreen the browser so you see the entire game!</p>\n<p>M to mute at any time</p>\n<p>Levels are timed, you gain score by picking up items, completing your list and doing so quickly!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be careful though, as some people in the shop are not wearing a mask, and being within 2m of them will cause your timer to go down very quickly - if you run out of time it's game over!</p>\n<p>Credit to Komiku for their piece of music \"School\" from the album \"Captain Glouglous Incredible Week Soundtrack\"\u00a0used under the CC0 1.0.
