You can change what each deer will do each day by clicking on their picture before setting out. Right now there are 2 areas, each with a medallion to find. Good luck!<br/><br/>This game is difficult to playtest on my own since I know how everything works, so any feedback is very appreciated :). This is the main reason I put this out so early, so I could maybe get some feedback while I work on the next areas. <br/></p>\n<p>You can follow me on Twitter @gharrot if you want to know when I update. I'll try to be vague there to not spoil anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I set this page to have a \"discussion board\" instead of comments. This because forums are cool and I miss them. Feel free to leave dumb comments down there, don't worry about actually discussing anything (unless you want to).<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T21:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f8461a5678ccc7e71a85d2cbb47a66f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucbou"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
