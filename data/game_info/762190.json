Additionally, we have a client side web-application that connects to the desktop client in order for players to easily play the game through a link on mobile as well as desktop. Real time communication proved to be a demanding challenge, which resulted in us using a myriad of technologies to combat the issues faced. The tools include Node.js, Socket.io, Tailwind, and Vue.js to allow for an interactive full-stack web experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T13:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ed/6ed69c16f14fcb3da8ee66471deaa414.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["onewebdev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
