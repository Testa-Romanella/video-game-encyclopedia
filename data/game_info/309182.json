Feed it a song, space out, and be whisked away into a unique geometric journey. <br/><br/>Maybe you've encountered this feeling in real life: driving down the highway, or riding a bike, and the song you're listening to just somehow feels perfectly in sync. NOISETUBE aims to capture this emotion of barreling through space at just the right speed based on the intensity of the song.<br/><br/>NOISETUBE is powered by feeding it a music file from your computer and it generates an ever expanding tunnel for you to be shot through in space.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b6cb32ff43ee4a07b662f61f3c116c3.jpg", "website": "http://www.beliefengine.com/noisetube/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Belief Engine", "Mike Monroe"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Belief Engine"], "esrb_rating": null}
