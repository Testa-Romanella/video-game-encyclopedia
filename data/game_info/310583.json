Your job is to maneuver through rocks and reach extraction sites, all while avoiding damage to your ship. You also get the chance to upgrade your ship or buy new ones. Every ship has its own unique character and traits, and none is better than the others.</p>\n<p>Gameplay and controls are explained inside the game. Only a mouse is needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In future updates I plan on adding:<br/>- more missions and levels<br/>- different terrain types<br/>- items for use inside missions, granting specific timed bonuses<br/>- secondary goals</p>\n<p>There's a button hidden in the hub that allows you to change the difficulty mid-game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c641b6c06b0181c02df8f6f7afe77e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheJonu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
