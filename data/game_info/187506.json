The player controls the lead dancer's legs with four keys. Each key will move one of the two legs forward or back. Another key makes the dancer move in a manner that is roughly similar to what is known as a swing pulse in blues dancing. The follower dancer will move to roughly match the lead's movements. The user is encouraged to play their own choice of blues music and try to match the rhythms without falling over. <br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>a key - move left leg forward</p><p>d key - move right leg forward</p><p>z key - move left leg back</p><p>c key - move right leg back</p><p>s key - pulse</p><p>r key - reset application</p><p>esc key - quit application</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af7/af7fedcac1b0b0e90da4357d072d5a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["inquisitivegeek"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
