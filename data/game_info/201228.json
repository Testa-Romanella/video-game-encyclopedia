What's my game about and why did I chose to make it:</p>\n<p>My game is about risk and exploration. I've always been fascinated by the Ancient World. I find it wildly interesting and, at times, unpredictable. I am training to become an archaeologist. This game is meant to represent my tomb exploring fantasy. There's a new challenge around every turn. I wanted the player to have to make decisions. I wanted the play to\u00a0 rely on their reflexes. I want the player to feel immersed. My life is boring. This game represents its metaphorical existence...hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>2.\u00a0 I enjoyed designing each tomb the most. I hand-placed each block, aiming to create a different feel and use for each room. I want the player to wish for a specific room and dread encountering another! I put myself into each corridor. The room design is where I managed to stamp myself into the game world. One stressful corner could be midterm week. One open, but dark, space could be the uncertainty of \"life after college\". I enjoyed making myself through the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/106bb03703461ba2fa64254a378e15a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenFried"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
