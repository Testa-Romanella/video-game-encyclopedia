Its options are currently: Patrol when idle (between a fixed list of waypoints); if the player enters its field of view, it will chase the player; if it catches the player, it will go to a safepoint. However, if the player sees the ghost AND the ghost sees the player, the ghost will run away, to one of a predetermined list of safepoints. It will choose a safepoint that a) is not within the player's FOV and b) where it won't have to go directly past the player in order to get to the safepoint.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p> I created the game in Unity, using Unity 2020.3.7 LTS and the Universal Render Pipeline. I am hoping to spend some more time polishing this up, as I had a lot of fun with it! <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse to look around, WASD to move.<br/></p>\n<p>Ghost model and animations from Meshtint Studio: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:48:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/5246d87cc38182682da8fbac9b8322f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScarletConcerto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
