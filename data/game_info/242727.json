Each player is tasked to find all the items, and then hide one of their own for the next player to find. This way, the game evolves and gets bigger each time it is played.<br/><br/>There are two doors that cannot be unlocked until you find 5 and 20 collectibles respectively. This means that until the game has been played that many times, those areas are inaccessible.<br/><br/>This game was made in a fairly short amount of time for the Godot Wild Game Jam in Godot with server hosted on AWS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c631fa3124220de9386a4bf855bbe519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Proud Mom Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
