Once they contact the middle line, you must hit the circle using your keyboard!</p>\n<p>- If they came from the left, you must hit <strong>D</strong> or <strong>F</strong> on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>- If they came from the right, you must hit <strong>J</strong> or <strong>K</strong> on the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Though some circles aren't that simple! Some circles will pass through or bounce on the middle line multiple times, leading to tricky juggling scenerios.</p>\n<p>Other circles have tricker routes on the way to the middle. Some circles will snake and turn. Others even take steps back to trick you!</p>\n<p><strong>Can you keep up with the swarm?</strong><br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Game created and programmed by MayoGhost</li><li>Music used from Chillhop Music</li><li>\u00a0Made with L\u00d6VE</li></ul>\r\nProgress &amp; More Info\r\n<p>Made for Portland Indie Game Squad's Summer Slow Jams July 2020<br/></p>\n<p>Though made for the game jam, I want to keep working on the game post-jam.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently, there's only 3 songs, with 3 difficulty options.<br/></p>\n<p>But I plan to create the full game with a larger collection of songs!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:35:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1fc26e8d280a2bad4c6ce0c28ad1558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MayoGhost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
