I started to learn to code games with Unity just at the start of October this month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is such a challenging experience and the outcome is subpar but I'm quite proud of myself for pushing through and finishing this game as it is. Hopefully I will get better the next time around.</p>\n<p>This game is a combination of Chess and 2D Fighting Game. The way you upgrade and demote your chess piece is calculated through the Chess Piece Value compared to the enemy you just killed. The goal is to get as many kills as you can and not die. Thanks for checking out my game :).</p>\n<p>I did both the art and the coding by myself.</p>\n<p>All Art is done by me. Sound Effects by\u00a0@dustyroomgames.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4d/f4d3fff887042a129cc7ae32047b43a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joserigel"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
