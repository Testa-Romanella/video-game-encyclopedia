{"id": 293637, "slug": "sunday-neko", "name": "Sunday Neko", "name_original": "Sunday Neko", "description": "<p>Sunday Neko is a turn-based rpg, art style is 2D side view, and battle style is set to be similar to older j-rpgs, FF, Star ocean, and Dragon Warrior. this game will be heavily focused on nature environment and AI, each world is randomly generated, and choice will play a major impact from early on in the game. All in game items are to be intractable(movable, stealable), and materials will be set in for making and tuning gear, for alchemy, and other uses. Plants will be harvest able, leading to material for potions/herbal creations. Also there is cats. Anyways, this build has some housing and items set up (like the produce stand), and everything done so far with the nature simulation(a decent bit), but the focus of this is a single battle with a boss, once you are done, some menus don't go away and your character will scitz out so be warned.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:13:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/56975cf0120abb0f8eb3cb9c7749c85e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["apricotMae"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
