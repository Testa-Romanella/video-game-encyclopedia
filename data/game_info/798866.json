A version of the game that doesn't require this may come eventually. Otherwise, you can host a server for just yourself and throw some bombs around for fun\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, it should be possible to use LAN over the internet programs such as Hamachi to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/455/4556b1dcef913c492f7ed4c56ff68ce1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["cheesycoke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
