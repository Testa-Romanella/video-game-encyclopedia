But for some reason, the image of the peach tree in his dreams lingered in his head. He insists that his partner Qi Mei is waiting for him under the tree.<br/><br/>This image of the peach tree woke his remaining memories. The little things between him and his family after retirement, the interactions with the villagers when he was delivering their mails, the time when his children were born, and his days spent in the army are all returning to him. In each and every one of those memories, he was always with Qi Mei.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As his illness worsened, Zhao Sheng became unconscious of the difference between memory and reality, the difference between day and night, and unable to recognise his friends and families, but what hadn't changed was that he always remembered Qi Mei, who waited for him beneath the peach tree. Zhao Sheng\u2019s family didn't want him to leave with any regrets and decided to go and find that peach tree he had been talking about, the place where he and Qi Mei made a promise to each other.
