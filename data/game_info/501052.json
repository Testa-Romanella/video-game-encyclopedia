At first I was thinking to collaborate with someone, but after some time I decided to make a game solo.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam is \"stuck in a loop\", so I brainstormed a bit and all Ideas was about how we stuck in our day routines. I thought these ideas are too complicated and I don't like too complicated things I like simple ones. So, I always wanted to make a hyper casual game and I decided that the jam is a great opportunity to do this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I made a very simple game where you fly around an orbit (loop) and avoid obstacles.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/4876d646d4c8cbf2c5706d8a4e00de89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dmitry Mozgin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
