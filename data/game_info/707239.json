{"id": 707239, "slug": "round-ogre", "name": "Round Ogre", "name_original": "Round Ogre", "description": "<p><strong>Round Ogre</strong> is a <strong>puzzle game</strong> with simple controls: swipe to move in a direction. (Keyboard and mouse fully supported too.)<br/><br/>The puzzles, however, are anything <em>but</em> simple. Round Ogre is so excited about everything, that a single move shoots her off into that direction until <em>something</em> stops her.<br/><br/>Maybe a mattrass wall will bounce her back. Maybe a jail door closes behind her. Or her cute pet mole stops her before she falls into a ravine.<br/><br/>Guide her to the cave exit to reunite her with Square Ogre. But to do so, you'll have to think creatively and always see all the possibilities ...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>500 puzzles</strong> across<strong> 31 worlds</strong> will entertain you for hours! <br/><br/>Start of a new world? A brand new mechanic to explore! This makes the game easy to learn, yet varied and challenging.<br/></p>\n<p>Solving a complete world grants you an optional <em>bonus world</em>, with the toughest testing puzzles.<br/><br/>A free demo is available on the Play Store, supported by ads. (The full game has no ads or restrictions whatsoever.)</p>\n<p>The prequel, Square Ogre, is all about restoring his eyesight. Each turn you had to take into account how far he could <em>see</em>.<br/><br/>Round Ogre has no such eye troubles. She's alive and running all the time, which means this game adds <strong>other living creatures</strong> and a <strong>sleep cycle.</strong> <br/><br/>You'll be bouncing from mattrass walls, running into fireflies and glowworms, and venturing over all sorts of terrain. <br/></p>\n<p>But most importantly: after all this work, Round Ogre is tired and <em>will</em> fall asleep. Let's just hope she isn't in some dangerous spot when it happens.</p>\n<p>This game is the sequel to Square Ogre ... sort-of. It's more of a standalone expansion.</p>\n<p><strong>You <em>don't</em> need to play the original to enjoy it.</strong></p>\n<p>The core objective and input are the same. A handful of basic mechanics and themes are the same as well, and you'll appreciate those more if you know where they came from.<br/></p>\n<p>But in all other ways, this game stands on its own and is completely different.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback is highly appreciated</strong>, send me an email at: askthepanda@pandaqi.com</p>\n<p>With every puzzle game, I learn and grow as a developer. This one is already far better (in my opinion) than its prequel, and I plan to make many more puzzle games to entertain players all around the world.</p>\n<p>Your feedback matters, it really does. Even if you hate the game, even if you only gave it 10 minutes of your time.</p>\n<p>Have fun puzzling Round Ogre to the exit!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T19:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee4e2e30310d1e0ce7d1fa7a5948da5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
