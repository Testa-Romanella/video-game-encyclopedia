Craft new weapons, upgrade your fighter and build an ultimate aerial war machine!<br/><br/><br/>After the fifth world war, there was peace in the world. For over a decade, the Grand Alliance has been leading humanity towards a better tomorrow by stifling all dangers in the bud. For some time, however, there is suspicion of a new threat that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>As a member of SAF forces, your mission is to take over the Shielton base, captured by unknown rebels. No one knows who they are and what they want. What's worse, even IMC forces couldn't drive them away from the base because of their advanced weaponry. Weaponry out of this world. But... are those rebels the main threat? Isn't there anything bigger behind all this? No time for questions! You must stop them at all costs!<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay mechanics are very simple - destroy all enemies and try to avoid every bullet... well, at least those which can be avoided. Your special maneuver allows you to dodge normal projectiles. Even if you get hit, you will only lose one extra weapon! However, watch out for powerful bosses! They can thorn you into pieces with their ultimate unavoidable attacks!<br/><br/><br/>The story mode can be completed in a few various ways. Military operations are carried out on several fronts simultaneously. It's up to you which path you will choose. From battles high in the sky, through military bases, underground factories, collapsed mines and abandoned laboratories, to secret Arctic research facilities and the interiors of unknown civilization artifacts - you must go through all of this several times to accomplish all missions.<br/><br/><br/>Every difficulty level is different. Improving your skills and fighter will help you out at facing hard and insane mode bosses, as they don't appear at easier levels. Enemy's layouts will change as well as their shooting patterns. At higher difficulties, you will also meet enemies that you have not met before.<br/><br/><br/>Collecting drop parts and blueprints throughout the missions will allow you to unlock and craft new fighters, weapons, and upgrades. However, remember that only playing at the highest levels of difficulty will allow you to achieve a pinnacle of technology.
