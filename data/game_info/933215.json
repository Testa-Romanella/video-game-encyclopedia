FREE DEMO", "description": "<p>Blew It! is a Rom/Com Visual Novel true to the Ecchi style - from heartwarming romances to somewhat... spicier... arrangements, you'll find only fun &amp; romance in this comedy. All of the art for this game was created using Artificial Intelligence, and we're on a mission to demonstrate an ethical path forward with AI art that protects real artists.</p>\n<p>No attempt has been *or will ever* be made to copyright the artwork for this game. It is considered public domain and we respect the rights of artists to keep the real right to their own work. And as an added bonus - stick around for the credits and you'll be given AI prompts to meet these lovely ladies yourself!</p>\n<p>This game does not contain nudity (though uh... We got pretty close!) or graphic descriptions of sexual activity. With four fun ladies, er... one sociopath and three lovely ladies, you'll explore the most eventful week in Osamu's life as he nears his high school graduation just after his 18th birthday.</p>\n<p>This game was produced using a combination of 3D model AI-assisted art, AI assisted art, and AI generated art. We do not support the copyrighting of AI generated images in any fashion to preserve the direct profits of art for artists. We consider all character art and CG visual assets in this game to be public domain. Besides, the internet has no shortage of sexy visuals - you came to meet Veronica, Luna, Ms. Aoko Swanson, and Elyse!</p>\n<p>Each of these voluptuous ladies has their own rich, touching, funny, and sometimes sad story... complete with several different endings each and 20+ unlockable CGs. Yep, that's technically over a dozen endings. </p>\n<p>Yeah, we know. It's a lot. Our fingers still hurt and at least one keyboard didn't survive the development process.</p>\n<p>Not counting one very persuasive sociopath, you can expect your time with each of these ladies to take around an hour from start to finish. And these girls give you... plenty... of reason to come back and learn about each and every one of them. </p>\n<p>To make life easier for VN explorers, you'll be accompanied on your trip by Blewit!\u00a0 Your survival instinct manifest in faerie form!!!! In lingerie. She'll poke her head in at certain critical decision points to let you know that it's a really good time to drop one of those save game thingies. Not that she wants to get all meta on you.</p>\n<p>THIS IS THE FREE DEMO OF \"BLEW IT\". YOU ARE LOCKED IN TO ONE CHARACTER TRACK IN THIS DEMO<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoy this demo and want the chance to get to know Luna, Veronica, or Ms. Swanson just a \"little better\", then come purchase the full version right here on itch.io!!! ---&gt; https://erodhcandc.itch.io/blew-it<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b3bd3c33776afe9570bdd602e2a133d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ERODHCandC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
