There are 6 romanceable characters: Avalon, Gary, Elliot, Cain, Akio, and John--and quite a colorful supporting cast. The goal is to help the protagonist, Robin, achieve her happy ending after leaving home. Careful though, not everyone has her best interests at heart. Buried beneath the mass of anime tropes lies some pretty heavy and not always easy to recognize issues. Half parody and 100% from the heart, Pipe Dream is a result of our love of the otome game genre and our sincere hope that the world of otome gaming can expand its horizons.</p>\n<p>The demo contains the first section of the common route: over 20,000 words of content!</p>\n<p>Keep an eye out for the Kickstarter coming soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10b/10bd5413eb3ce0d65acddc949501c149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Notome Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
