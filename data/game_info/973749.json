{"id": 973749, "slug": "arcadia-sports", "name": "Arcadia Sports", "name_original": "Arcadia Sports", "description": "Arcadia Sports is a collection of arcade games with a sports theme for Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad.<br/><br/>The collection consists of 11 games (with many more to come):<br/><br/>- Formula Race<br/>Compete in the premier racing series and outpace your opponents with skillful overtaking maneuvers.<br/><br/>- Hoop Fever<br/>Juggle, shoot and score. All with just one finger. Possible? Certainly. Easy? I wouldn't say so.<br/><br/>- Basket<br/>Getting the ball in the hoop is a given. But what if the hoop had to target the ball instead?<br/><br/>- 8-Ball Pool<br/>Classic 8-Ball in solo mode. Sink balls of one type (solid or striped) first and then the rest, culminating in the 8-ball.<br/><br/>- 9-Ball Pool<br/>Hit the lowest numbered ball first, but numerical order isn't necessary for pocketing.<br/><br/>- Air Hockey<br/>Similar to hockey, minus the ice and Zamboni. First to reach 10 points wins.<br/><br/>- CyberSoccer<br/>Turn-based soccer, a new twist.<br/>Each CyberPlayer manages a zone on the field. If the ball lands there, it's their turn.<br/><br/>- MiniGolf (Course A)<br/>Golf, but downsized with compact courses full of obstacles and challenges.<br/><br/>- MiniGolf (Course B)<br/>Similar to before, but with different courses (and challenges).<br/><br/>- Bowling<br/>A classic! Knock down all the pins, preferably in one roll. Easier said than done, right?<br/><br/>- RainBowling<br/>Bowling meets a rainbow, with explosive pins and obstacles. Not quite the rainbow we remember.<br/><br/>Is this a small offering? Don't worry!<br/>This is just the beginning.<br/>We're already working on new games that will be added to the collection over time.<br/><br/>Additional Features:<br/>- Advanced support for Apple Watch (Series 1 to Series 8 and Ultra)<br/>- 120 fps support on compatible devices<br/>- iCloud support for saving progress<br/>- Game Center support for online leaderboards<br/>- No advertisements<br/>- No tracking", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T07:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/37436eb6e0a590f1fade51aaaabfce53.jpg", "website": "http://arcadia.watch", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Raffaele D'Amato"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Raffaele D'Amato"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
