Collect the missing soup cans and return to where they belong.</p><p>All sprites and textures were made in MS Paint.\u00a0 The game demonstrates in a weird way how Warhol's pop art was meant to defy the more expressive and emotional art mainstream art was known for, and instead focused on themes of banality and modernity.</p>\n<p>This is more like a demo, since the game didn't finish in time. I'll be adding some interesting enemies, sounds, and more polish in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T04:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/70905f7c53b097aded16fa421579e5da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MonkeBusiness"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
