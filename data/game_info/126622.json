There are no controls, no scoring, no user input, and not much else traditionally associated with a game. Your little person will walk around, grow up and eventually die. They'll continue to age even when the game isn't running, so be sure to spend as much time with them as you can.</p><p><strong><em>Being </em></strong>was built for the Ruin Jam (though not finished in time to be submitted) as a way to help ruin games for those who want them to be a specific type of thing.</p><p>If you like, you can follow the author on Twitter via @in_orbit and view more games and other stuff at the Mantis-Eye Labs website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd80df3edf820c9b110ec2469a11d67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mantis-Eye Labs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
