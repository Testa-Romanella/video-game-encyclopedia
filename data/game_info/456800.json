The more you absorb before firing, the bigger and faster your bullet will be.</p>\n<p>My first game outside summer camps, my first project with Godot, and made for my first Game Jam, the Sky mini jam. This one's hitting some boxes! Hopefully I checked the \"fun\" box, too.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T07:08:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lytebyrst"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
