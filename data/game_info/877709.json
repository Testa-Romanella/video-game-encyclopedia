You're set out to save the last ones of your kind left, and to do so you must kill the mechanical hydra. Funnily enough, you'll do it with her own weapon - electricity, and also a good old sword. Charge up by hitting enemies with the sword and release the charge using a lightning bolt!<br/><br/>The game includes 3 rather small areas, with each having a unique song and a bossfight!<br/><br/><br/>fun fact: I accidentally left in a thing to skip 90% of the game in the first version but it's now fixed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T16:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c2bcc399add4db2542e4271b0cec545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MasxeBoi"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
