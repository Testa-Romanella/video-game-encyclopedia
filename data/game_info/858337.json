They require different truck types. A transport request could require to deliver goods to a destination or pick up goods to bring them back. Express contracts need fulfillment faster than normal contracts. Long distance contracts can take longer and require the driver to sleep in the truck cabin.<br/></p>\n\n<strong>Plan tours<br/></strong>\n<p>Select the destinations,\u00a0the\u00a0truck, the trailer and\u00a0its\u00a0driver.\u00a0Ideally\u00a0fill\u00a0the\u00a0truck completely\u00a0with\u00a0goods for\u00a0delivery (out-bound) and\u00a0for\u00a0pick\u00a0up\u00a0(in-bound). Drivers may only drive a certain time per day. Not all trucks have a cabin for sleeping. Try to optimize the required driving time by arranging the order of the contracts. Trucks will not drive on Sundays. Drivers will go home at the evening if not on tour yet.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hire more employees\r\n<br/></strong>\n<p>New drivers required for more trucks.
