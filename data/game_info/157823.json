You are James Henry, and you suffer from PTSD and high stress issues. When your local hospital runs out of hallucination medicine, you must survive three nights until you get more medicine to get rid of the hallucinations of your past and regrets.</p>\n<p>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The Game has three nights that you must survive, you must manage your house's power and cooling while making sure the\u00a0hallucinations don't get into the room with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WHAT INSPIRED IT:<br/>This game actually originally started as a prototype resource management game, it was to see if I could make a resource management game, but it quickly transformed into a horror game after I got scared when watching the enemy move about the map. A major inspiration was Five Night at Freddy's, but another inspiration was surprisingly Fallout 4 and Minecraft (FNAF for the style, Fallout 4 for the Resource Management, and Minecraft for the pixelated visuals.)</p>\n<p>WHEN WILL IT BE OUT:<br/>The game will come out on 7/20/2018 at exactly mid-day Central Time UTC-5, it may not show up on the site's search engine until the next day so I recommend saving the URL of this page or coming back to the game on the 20th if you want to buy it.</p>\n<p>HOW MUCH WILL IT COST:<br/>Like my previous game (The Adventures of a Hero), this game will only cost 1 dollar to purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out my game's page and for even buying it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/949/94946b976ee75fea588b1d0cd76016b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Plasma Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
