They were sacrificing the most dangerous beasts like pigs, goats and others to their gods. And these very gods were choosing the next place to sacrifice. This time, our brave viking with helmet on his eyes needed to go far far away to make the sacrifice. The animals which he needed were hidden by the enemies in caves! And from these caves only one thing could get them out: THE MEOW OF A KITTEN!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong>:\u00a0<strong>A/D</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>Arrow Keys!</strong></li><li><strong>Jump</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Space!</strong></li><li><strong>Double jump</strong>: Press space and than second time when you need it!</li><li><strong>Pick up</strong>\u00a0/\u00a0<strong>put down</strong>\u00a0pigs and other very endangered species:\u00a0<strong>E!</strong></li><li><strong>Sacrifice</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Q!</strong>\u00a0(Only near the altar and don\u2019t sacrifice the kitten you bully!)</li><li><strong>Have fun</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Just play!</strong>\u00a0:P</li></ul>\n\r\nFrom our team\r\n<p>We did it!

The ancient technique to lure the animals!\r\n\r\nLevel 1 walkthrough:\r\n\r\nWe added Level 2 walkthrough on youtube!\r\n<p><strong>Change log</strong><br/>We needed to update the game in two places:<br/>- there was a typo in the game over information, it was scaled down in the big screen and had wrong color which was almost unreadable<br/>- in Level 2 we got rid of one spikes which we found behind flowers. That was causing sudden death of the Player because of the wrong collison there :/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/77163accc24d433928f35fddfcff2671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucidus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
