The player must match the pattern shown on the preview in order to pass the puzzle.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game will ONLY work on 1920x1080 res. This is because of how I setup the preview canvas.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out this small side project of mine, and hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>I am always looking to improve, C&amp;C is welcome even though It is extremely unlikely that I will ever return to this project.</p>\n<p>Cheers Mates!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d50d248ce3f08748b02ece682220b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Spinks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
