He had been working as a janitor at the Galton Hotel for over 8 years, spending each and every day cleaning and preparing the hallways of the 26th floor. But now he really is trapped. Trapped in the very hallways the he thought he knew like the back of his hand. As he madly goes through door after door everything begins to blur together. Now he must use his remaining wit to figure out a way to tell these hallways apart and break free from this eternal cycle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Doors you navigate a series of hallways, looking for the correct door. To figure out which door is the correct one you must observe the subtle changes in your environment that will point you in the right direction. Learn the hallway well, and with a keen eye you might be able to escape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Made by these sanitation engineers:</p>\n<p>Justin Capcap - code</p>\n<p>Keita Lorente - sound</p>\n<p>Michael Arcadi - code</p>\n<p>Yani Wang - art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f61579cc054f94669792c6b362efab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arcadim", "CapSquared", "yaniwang", "LunarSong x/0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
