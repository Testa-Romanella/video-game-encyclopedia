Stone, water, and life create harmony among nature, and so the nomadic tribe of \r\n\tFauna have settled, for a time, here; to create a monument that embodies rock. Their dance, the embodiment of fluid, will hopefully establish a connection to the elementals, and in return they will breathe new life into the tribe.\r\n\t</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\r\n\tThis, is Stonehenge.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tStonehenge is a cooperative local multi game for 2 or 4 players. Each player controls limbs of a druid who is trying to fit through different shaped blocks. \r\n\t<strong>Do the splits</strong> or <strong>wave \"hi\" to your mom</strong>! Just be aware of the speeding mystical rock foundations that are out to knock you out... <strong>stone cold</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Made by Blake Grotewold: (@groteworld) &amp; Ian Sundstrom (@iansundstrom) in 48 hours as part of Global Game Jam 2016.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><br/>\n</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/9177ed61fd44b4e5e24685e3f28ebcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ian & Elie", "groteworld"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
