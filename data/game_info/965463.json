It is a collection of loosely connected mystery/horror stories, based on the old book of supernatural tales Ugetsu Monogatari.</p>\n<p>In the PC-98 version, a young girl guides the player from a busy street to a tent containing a labyrinth occupied by Japanese mythical creatures, in which the player experiences several stories based on the Ugetsu Monogatari, with vignettes from the original scenario in-between.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation version, which was released several years later, changes the introduction and other aspects, like the order of the stories. In this version the player wakes up in a hospital, and after jumping from the building&#39;s roof, is guided to the same tent and labyrinth as in the PC-98 version. The PlayStation version also changes many graphical assets from the typical PC-98 pixel art style to digitized photographs and prerendered 3D CGI.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-27T02:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a80ba21d8fc6019a7a60a5c08d8473a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Tokyo Shoseki"], "esrb_rating": null}
