Grab the two revolving orbs and guide them through iridescent mazes that twist and turn, forming structures like DNA. Will you discover the meaning of Squingle?<br/><br/><h3>Sensory Satisfaction</h3><br/><br/>Relax with refreshing visuals and a 3D tactile gameplay experience only possible in VR. <br/>Find your flow through 100 hand-crafted levels and a changing musical soundscape.<h3>Get Competitive</h3><br/><br/>Compete with Steam Leaderboards and Achievements \u2013 calling all Speed Runners \u2013 and challenge your own ghost at double-speed for double satisfaction.<h3>Addictive Gameplay</h3><br/><br/>Solve puzzles by switching your rotation with special orbs to find secret items, multiple paths and hidden routes, and master maneuvers around dangerous dances of obstacles. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Timing and movement</strong> are as important as puzzle solving in Squingle.
