{"id": 35187, "slug": "dungeon-siege-legends-of-aranna", "name": "Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna", "name_original": "Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna", "description": "<p>Dungeon Siege is an action role-playing game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Microsoft in April 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year by Destineer for Mac OS X. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn the nearby town of the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2003-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T07:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82f/82f0b84b3b8cec9fd592bd5c38cd7ae2.jpg", "website": "http://www.microsoft.com/games/dungeonsiegeloa/", "rating": 3.76, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 20, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 24, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 29, "suggestions_count": 594, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gas Powered Games", "Mad Doc Software"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
