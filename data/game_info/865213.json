The tutorial is a few years old and made for UE4, but I built it in UE5.\u00a0 I am building a total of 9 games purely from UE5 tutorials, in order to learn the basics of the engine. This particular game which I call 'Moving Platforms' is another very simple game that shows off some basic UE features.\u00a0\u00a0The tutorial I followed is\u00a0Creating Your First Game in Unreal Engine 5\u00a0on\u00a0Udemy, which is currently free. You can build the same game by following the tutorial too!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Installing and Running:\r\n</strong>Download the zipped file, then unzip the file. Run the TinyGame2.exe executable file, and the game should begin!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Directions: </strong>You are a mannequin. Congrats!\u00a0But now you have to reach the platform on the far upper right with a table &amp; two chairs. The moving platforms that look like big garden planters move back &amp;\u00a0forth, and you can jump on them to reach the destination. Alert:\u00a0The big platforms can't hold your weight, and fall down after about 15 seconds!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>To move, use WASD along with your mouse to 'mouselook'.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>To jump, press the Spacebar!\u00a0</li><li>To pause the game and bring up the list of keys, press 'P' for pause.</li><li> To restart the level if you get stuck, just press 'R'.</li><li>To quit the game, simply press the Backspace button (or '&lt;-Back' )</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T07:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a02888f6c883a1390746198b0f28f19f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simple Shorts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
