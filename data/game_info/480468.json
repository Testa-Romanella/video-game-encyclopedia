{"id": 480468, "slug": "whackamurloc", "name": "WhackAMurloc", "name_original": "WhackAMurloc", "description": "<p>The world of men\u00a0is under siege once more. Not by an army of the undead, nor a legion of demons. This time the enemy was already at the shore. They came from the water, nergling and spitting. The murloc tide has risen and we were not prepared!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>WhackAMurloc is a lane defense, strategy game that will require you to make real-time decisions and use tactical nuance to achieve victory.\u00a0The action is frenetic but comes in waves to give you time to recover. The deeper you get into the game, the more intense and difficult the battles become. More varied and powerful enemies in greater numbers will force\u00a0you to learn from failure and adjust your strategy to meet each independent challenge.</p>\n<p>It is inspired by the original Plants vs Zombies\u00a0and my adventures in\u00a0the Warcraft Universe.\u00a0If you would like to read the original backstory (it's fan-lore\u00a0aligned with cannon), you can check it out here.</p>\n<p>I built this game as my capstone project for\u00a0the <em>Michigan State University Games Design and Development Specialization </em>on Coursera. It is the result of about <strong>120 hours</strong> <strong>of work</strong> over a total of approximately 10 days (a little more than 3 weekends). All the development, design etc is a solo effort but, as I am not an artist or musician, most of the assets were either purchased or downloaded (Royalty-free) and modified where necessary. Check out the credits in-game for the list of artists.\u00a0<br/><br/>WhackAMurloc is <strong>under development </strong>and there are\u00a0definitely some\u00a0<strong>bugs!\u00a0</strong>It still needs major balancing (honestly I'm not entirely sure if it's too easy or completely impossible), but it took a lot of effort to get this far and I'm definitely going to keep working on it over time.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to play my game. I would really, really appreciate any feedback.\u00a0I hope you enjoy slaying some murlocs!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ChangeLog</strong></p>\n<p><em>2020/08/11 - v0.0.1</em></p>\n<ol><li>Fixed pause bug on Victory Menu Next button.</li><li>WebGL doesn't seem to support keyboard events on new Input System.<ol><li>Added Pause button to battles.\u00a0</li><li>Added click exit to Credits.\u00a0</li></ol></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:35:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c0a5856204fc4889a800c558eca6cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Renevatium"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
