The finished product will have more puzzle-like features and will build more on the story. I'd appreciate a download as it will help pay my college fees and help me make better games. I hope you enjoy, please tell me what you think! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab8f854fae76c0e8e72db53602651d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IceLoli"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
