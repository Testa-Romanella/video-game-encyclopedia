You'll be one of the first handful of people to ever play this little game! Try and get all six endings!\u00a0:D</p>\n<p>I wrote \"a tardigrade's tale\" within 48 hours, game jam-style, for an assignment in my intro game design class that I'd procrastinated on (not counting research and design, which I'd been picking at throughout the semester). It's an interactive fiction game in Twine centered around the theme \"Microscopic World\".\u00a0Maybe it was the pressure of trying to finish, but I put out some of my funniest writing in just a few hours that weekend.\u00a0I tend not to give myself praise easily, and even I think I\u00a0managed to be both hilarious and tangentially-educational with this thing. It's probably the most polished and complete game I've made myself, so I'm very proud! (Feedback from friends and family on the bare-bones version\u00a0has been overwhelmingly positive, and I got a 100 on the assignment!)</p>\n<p>In the past few days, I updated this game with a few more illustrations (which has been on my to-do list forever). Though I didn't finish all of them, it's still a lot more than there was before, so\u00a0here's the grand interwebs debut version for the Raleigh Game &amp; Geek Expo!\u00a0The pictures aren't crucial (and the ones that are in the game now\u00a0do have alt-text), but I'm hoping to come back to this to complete that soon.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll laugh at my terrible jokes at least half as much as I did (and maybe learn some neat things about some tiny organisms)!</p>\n<p>Joshitha L.
