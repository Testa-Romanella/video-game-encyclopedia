This project uses 3d spatial audio which allows for more precise localisation of sounds. I strongly encourage you to put on a pair of headphones for the best experience. You play as a Robot and your task is to collect your missing parts. While navigating through the level you will have to avoid two types of obstacles. Firstly a water pond, which will damage your circuitry if you walk through them. Secondly, cliff edges, which can make you fall from the map. Stepping on any of the obstacles will cause the level reset. By using up and down arrows the robot will take two steps forward and backwards accordingly. Left and right arrows rotate your character by 90 degrees in the chosen direction. Pay attention to where the sound is coming from. For example, if a water pond is in front of you, you will hear the sound in both speakers. If it's exactly to your left you will hear it only through the left speaker. Objects can be located diagonally as the level is designed on a six by six grid map. In such instances, you have to listen carefully to how the position of the sound changes depending on your movement. I hope you will enjoy this mini level. Any feedback regarding the game and accessibility is welcomed. Hit me up\u00a0at headphaseaudio@gmail.com. All best!
