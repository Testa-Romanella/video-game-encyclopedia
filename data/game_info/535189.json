Just sit behind the panel, don't touch anything and watch as automated system does everything on its own.</p>\n<p>But, this night everything went horribly wrong and system stoped. You need to use panel to manually control whole lab and if you fail... Well... Nobody would know about that tommorow.. After the end of the world.</p><p>Controls:<br/></p><p><strong>LMK\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>LEFT ARROW\u00a0</strong>- left button<br/></p><p><strong>RMK\u00a0</strong>or\u00a0<strong>RIGHT ARROW\u00a0</strong>- right button<br/></p>\n<p>This game is designed to play in Coop (Keep talking and nobody explode style). YOne player tries to create stabilizer for reacton and second player uses Atomic Manual to guid first one. Obviously, both of you aren't allowed to see screens of each other.</p>\n<p>But, singleplayer mode also available in the game. It isn't as fun as Coop, but still it's an interesting puzzle game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba5cb33396fe045fa68b1be57a4ff99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vladocc"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
