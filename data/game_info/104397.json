{"id": 104397, "slug": "mayim", "name": "Mayim", "name_original": "Mayim", "description": "<p>A voxel building game that focuses on boat building\u00a0and liquid physics.</p>\n<p>This is a very early version. You can experiment with the speed and buoyancy of boats you build, based on your design. The boats will float according to Archimedes` principle (except it always remains upright), water will flow according to the law of communicating vessels,\u00a0 and there are some heuristics regarding friction and speed.</p>\n<p>There's an infinite world of islands where you can chop down trees and buy things in shops. Currently there's nothing in the water.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to start with either 'practice' or 'normal' modes and follow the tips.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>New features will be added soon. Feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1af/1af4bd99169ceb05acc05611a96dbac1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["udiprod"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
