However, this isn't without obstacles! Lava pockets and gravity itself play against you as you excavate.</p>\n<p>Luckily, your mineral-powered drill allows you to move upwards and over chasms as long as you have ground to dig. Yet, you have to keep moving and be very precise!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: As of now, this is a limited proof-of-concept, showing off several mechanics including drilling, magma and the mission system. There're currently two short-but-fun missions to complete, using the in-game bulletin board.</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to leave helpful comments below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/499fff984779d4f8ec6318b5e56eb18e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuciusWrath"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
