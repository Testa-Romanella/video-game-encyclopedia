A path will be drawn to show you where the character goes. While moving you can encounter enemy units which will begin a battle between yours and theirs armies.</p>\n<p>There is no end goal (but you can win 3 battles).</p>\n<p>Feel free to put 0 on Theme - the idea was to have underground passages to go to new maps (going deeper and deeper underground) and fighting through enemies to reach the goal. The scope was too big for a lone programmer, so I wasn't able to finish all of the intended features.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fef9e838977e8c4f2157814867c63dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pixel Lifetime", "Tanaka"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
