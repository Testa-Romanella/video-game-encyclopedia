The spaceship moves around the\u00a0galaxy and protect galaxy from various asteroids and enemies. Asteroids and enemies attacks the\u00a0spaceship. The spaceship shoots and destroy his enemies and save galaxy. The score are being\u00a0increased automatically by destroying each asteroids and enemies.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, video-game industry is one of the biggest and fastest growing around, providing jobs to many people and having a very big market. From the 1950s until now, many different video-game genres were created suiting different people tastes. Among them, Shoot \u2019em up games mainly consist of a player trying to complete the game while evading different obstacles which can include enemies, environmental objects, or different types of projectiles. \r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0During my whole life, I have spent countless hours playing a great variety of video-games. I was always interested in developing one by myself, which led me to consider making this project: a 2D video-game in shoot \u2019em up genre, which I have named Space Shooter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0By making Space Shooter, I have learned how the video-games can be designed and developed by our group. This process includes the usage of different tools for graphic and audio design such as Inkscape, Audacity, Adobe Photoshop as well as the Unity engine for combining them into a seamlessly working game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Using Inkscape, I have designed a variety of graphic objects for this game which include different spaceships made of simple geometrical figures, a big and complicated Boss ship and many miscellaneous objects used in level design and user interface. Regarding Audacity and Adobe Photoshop,\u00a0they were used to create sound effects that give the player an audio feedback when its ship gets damaged or an enemy ships explode. With respect to Unity, I have used it to design and develop a single working level with a careful crafted game logic, different particle effects and a complete menu system. For this purpose, I have utilized many different game creation tools that Unity offers in combination with the graphical and sound effects created before.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T11:42:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/546a429ee42e3a44faec5316738f116d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gurvirsingh"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
