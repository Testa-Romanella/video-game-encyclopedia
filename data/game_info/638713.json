{"id": 638713, "slug": "birbout", "name": "BIRBOUT!", "name_original": "BIRBOUT!", "description": "BIRBOUT! (a.k.a Sunny The Cockatiel) is an arcade platform shooter where you play as Sunny The Cockatiel. Desmond the Cat has stolen away your best friend Snowy and all of your weapons! But most importantly, your SEEDS! He's working along side the Plovers, who are tasked to stop Sunny at all costs. <br/><br/>Jump and screech through 30 levels in Campaign 1, Feathered Fury, unlocking 29 weapons along the way! There's also Mat Hatted Classics, six levels from the old beta versions of Sunny, where you can unlock hats for Sunny to wear! A number of free levels and stock weapons are also available to play right out of the gate. We also have full controller support, so if you have a gamepad, you'll feel right at home!<h3>So, what's different?</h3><br/>Sunny doesn't play like a traditional run and gun, almost all weapons are burst-damage weapons, with no automatics. Customise Sunny's loadout using 'Your Loadout' on the pause menu to change which weapons are equipped next life, and tackle any challenge the game throws at you any way you choose. Before you start unlocking weapons, the majority of enemies will be using exact copies of them in the level. Once you know how to play against a weapon, you can play with the weapon. <br/><br/>Eating seeds heals you, which drop from enemies or are found in secret mini-screens. Permanent weapon pickups are at the end of each stage, and you can use Warp Nests to jump to different parts of the stage and exit stages. Checkpoint Birdbaths can set your starting point closer to the goal, or can be smashed open with your weapons in order to get a lot of health, a time bonus and other bonuses.<h3>Feathered frens!</h3>We are also very big on community, so join our Discord server if you want to be a part of our community!
