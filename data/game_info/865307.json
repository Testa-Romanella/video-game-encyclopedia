Short point-and-click adventure game. ~5 minute playtime. Please post any bugs or issues in the comments below.<br/></p>\n<p>The Edge of Daylight is based on a level I made in Dreams on PS4 (video here), which is in turn based on a short story I wrote (which you can read here), which is in turn based on a real dream I had. The location is based heavily on my real grandmother's house, and textures/paintings/photographs are based on real ones, but she and her house are nice and not creepy.</p>\n<p>If I get a few players willing to play this, I may expand on this experience (as a separate project), do a version of my similarly strange novel \"Burnt Cake\", or somehow merge the two. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>PS. Secret Easter Egg for reading this far: press Z for a debug camera!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T08:03:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d648c87175d4bedb6ee48b6a9a0cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pat_Bren"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
