Minigames require keyboard typing, A &amp; D, entering numbers and dragging sliders.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong>\u00a0Delay the inevitable end to your settlement on Mars as long as you can to board as many researchers as you can onto your rocket ship. Overcooked vibes with hints of Among Us mini games, set in a beautiful sci-fi laboratory.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong>: We\u2019ve had people ask, and\u00a0<strong>YES, our music</strong>\u00a0was created by our very own developer\u00a0@Brainoid! I also created the sounds, so please do rate us in the Audio category!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong>: If you get \u201cstuck\u201d on lab equipment, try pressing E again to \u201cdisengage\u201d from it.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Streaming Our Game?</strong>\u00a0Unreal games often run poorly in OBS. We recommend adding the game to your scene as a \u201cGame Capture\u201d and checking the \u201cLimit capture framerate\u201d option. Also try checking the VSync option on / off in the game options.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>THE PROBLEM:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The GROWTH, an invasive species of plant, is expanding rapidly, consuming the planet! A dangerous large growth, known as the MOTHER VINE is destroying everything we\u2019ve ever built. We need to get off this planet, abandoning the planet, leaving our settlements and precious research equipment behind.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The only way off this planet is via my ROCKET. The trouble is, all the other RESEARCHERS are still at their settlements and need to make their way here. I must delay the inevitable Growth for as long as I can, to allow as many of my fellow researchers as possible to escape with me!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>REMINDERS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Generator</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Keep the <strong>GENERATOR </strong>fuelled!
