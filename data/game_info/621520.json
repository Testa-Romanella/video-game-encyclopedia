I decided to take the theme of \"joined together\" and explore how many connections in a line a player can handle. In this game, you take the role of a dog (with a jetpack, ofcourse) and are tasked with delivering mail around the map. However, the only way to carry the mail around is by tethering each delivery to the previous one! This means you'll be carrying mail around the sky in one big line of deliveries.</p>\n<p>Plan out your route\u00a0ahead of time, since once you pick up a delivery, there's no easy way of re-ordering it in the queue!\u00a0You'll need to make these deliveries in a timely manner to stave off the clock, but watch out for obstacles while you do! Too many hits may send the mail you're carrying tumbling to the ground...</p>\n<p>That's about it, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>- Owen</p>\n\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>Pamgaea by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4193-pamgaea</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>Your Call by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5018-your-call</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>SFX</p>\n<p>\"Dog_Bark.wav\" by michael_grinnell</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/464400/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>\"locking a door_01.wav\" by Dymewiz</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/131024/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Modifications: Trimmed empty sound at end</p>\n\n<p>\"snapping-chain\" by CosmicEmbers</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/161650/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Modifications: Trimmed empty sound at start/end</p>\n\n<p>\"FuiteDeGaz.wav\" by davidou</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/88461/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>\"8-Bit explosion\" by Prof.Mudkip</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/386862/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>\"UI Click\" by EminYILDIRIM</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/536108/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>\"Balloon Pop / Christmas cracker / Confetti Cannon\" by Breviceps</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/458398/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n\n<p>\"Beep 4\" by Eponn</p>\n<p>Link: https://freesound.org/s/528862/</p>\n<p>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2d2e9bdb36ca0dad0d692c11f74e78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
