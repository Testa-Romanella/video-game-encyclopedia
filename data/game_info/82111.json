It provides two random generators/eliminators and one manual picker.<br/>The first generator is the Straight  Eliminator - any team has the same probability to be selected (it does not matter if team has a seed #1 or #16). <br/>The second generator is the Weighted Eliminator - a team gets a weight according it's seed. As an example - team A with a seed #1 plays team B with a seed #16 in the first round. In this case the team A is entered into the picker drum 16 times and team B only once. Similarly, team C seed #5 plays team #12 - thus team C is entered 12 times and opponent team D 5 times.<br/><br/>Both these generators runs in the automatic mode - teams are fed into the picker drum according the draw (Round1, Round2, Sweet16, Elite8, Final4, Final). Results are kept in the database and prior the next run those results are cleared automatically.<br/><br/>The manual picker feeds teams according the draw but selection of the winner is up to you.<br/><br/>Please note the following:<br/>1. The real draw will be available a day after Monday Selection (for 2017 it is March 13) and will be automatically downloaded when you open the App.<br/>2. This App is not for 2017 draw only. It can be reuse in the coming years 2018, 2019,\u2026 but only for current size of 64 teams.<br/>3. Team names in App pictures are for demo purposes only and will the replaced with real college names after real draw is downloaded.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914c72a646f60f10e7493e82d099721b.jpg", "website": "http://www.pdasportstats.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Avruk"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Avruk"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
