Break ground and raise houses for your steambot citizens, keep them fed and provide some rootin'-tootin' entertainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's an abandoned mine sitting under your town, and it\u2019s rumored to be filled with ancient tech that holds the key to escaping the impending doom. Use the natural resources above ground and the abundant ores buried in the mine to expand your town. Stimulate new residential tiers to join the quest to dig deeper, unearth untold riches and ultimately help them to hightail it off the planet!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\nMANAGE<br/>\nAs the town expands in all directions, new kinds of steamfolk find their way to the settlement - and their needs are ever more complex to satisfy. To keep everyone content, you'll need to make sure everyone works their darn hardest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuy items to boost the efficiency of buildings. Keep goods flowing up and down the mine by speeding up the miners with encouraging jolts of electricity. Or, just barter at the local train station and get what you need that way. It's all up to you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\nMINE &amp; EXPLORE<br/>\nAs you go hunting deeper and deeper in the mine after riches, eventually something will start hunting you back.
