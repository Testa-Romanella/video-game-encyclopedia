I'm using\u00a0<em>Kirby Airride</em>\u00a0as inspiration for the racing mechanics. The player's \"kart\" is a physics sphere automatically being pushed forward, where the player steers via rotation of a forward vector. Braking, drifting and boosting are all tied to one button.</p>\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Controller</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong>MovementLeft Thumb StickArrow Keys, WASDDrift, Brake, BoostASpaceExit GameAlt+F4\r\n<p>My next plan is\u00a0changing how curves are traversed. Currently, when the kart moves onto a curved path, it\u00a0lerps its upwards vector to match the surface normal below it, with an additional force being applied to keep it on the\u00a0surface. It works, but it feels clunky during play. I'd like to replace this with a force pushing/pulling the kart from/to the curve at any point along it. This way I can choose to have the kart follow either flat or curved meshes being extruded along a curve.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Additional Packages used in project: </strong>Dreamteck Splines</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T06:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55fa12056481fc15b83f1d6f6f8f24e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["socknot"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
