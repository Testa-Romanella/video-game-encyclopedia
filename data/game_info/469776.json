You can also use your scrap to repair the radio in the center if it gets hit, or plan ahead and use it on the shield generator, which needs a lot of scrap to get going. There's a health pack in the attic that can be used if you get hit, but if it gets hit, it will need to be repaired as well.</p>\n<p><em>Can you survive long enough to call off the attack?</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:<br/></em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Click and aim with the mouse to repair walls</li><li>E to interact:<ul><li>Pick up scrap from the scrap bin, repair the radio, pick up health, and repair the shield generator</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vahan Ionnisian </strong>- Art, Design</p>\n<p><strong>Jackson Dean</strong> - Programming</p>\n<p><strong>Matthew Pawloski </strong>- Sound</p>\n<p>Original Global Game Jam 2020 submission here<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:52:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5d6e1e823ee6a35fee7eb0b17a7a80e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LydianChromatic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
