I work as a Software Engineer Trainee at a small German Company, where I don't do that much. Sometime ago I really wanted to start to develop my own game. I already knew C#, so Unity couldn't be that big of a struggle (it was that big of a struggle) So I started making this game with a little help of my friends. You can look at the credits if u wanna find out more about the people that are working on this game (Seriously thanks for the Art. I couldn't make this whole thing without it :)). The Game takes place in a school which I recreated from my memories of my old school. You are a student trapped and hunted by teachers (which is Haris... It's an insider joke). Your only chance to fight back. Yes. this is a Top-Down Shooter in a School. It's not that easy but I am sure u will get the hang of it.</p>\n\n\r\nHAVE FUN!\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any Bug to report, feel free to Mail me. I am also open for feedback and further questions about the game</p>\r\ndnold.png@gmail.com\r\n\r\nControls are pretty self \r\nself-explanatory\r\n\n<ul><li>WASD\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Move</li><li>LMB\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shoot</li><li>'R'\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reload</li><li>Shift\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Run</li><li>ESC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pause</li><li>1 or 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Switch Weapons</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d2fb9a44ba11c4c83c4ddc50752982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dnold"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
