Rows that no longer hinder the player (there are no white stones and no freedoms/holes for the white stones) are removed.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: arrows, ESC, 1, 2, mouse (in menus)<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a prototype. 90% of the visuals are created using third-party library Shapes, a great tool but not the best for WebGL builds, so there might be some issues playing in browser. <br/></p>\n<p>Scores are not stored between sessions in browser. Download Windows version to keep score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/866efb55810daa2d800e737e436598db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KorosPT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
