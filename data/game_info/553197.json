You are the worlds greatest dodgeball champion. Can you use your skills and knowledge of dodgeball to defeat these fiends and save the planet?</em>\n\n<p><strong>This game was made for Beginner Friendly Game Jam\u00a0\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/beginner-friendly-game-jam. The theme for the jam was \"Not enough information.\"\u00a0 For that theme I decided to forego building an interface. You will need to play, learn, and remember the game to understand its mechanics. Sorry, I'm not going to spoil that here. After the Jam is over I will be going back to add an interface.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The goal of this jam was to\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Learn and improve your game dev skills.</strong></li><li><strong>Meet new people and learn from the professionals.</strong></li><li><strong>Get feedback on your game.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>I did learn some new things with the making if this game. One goal I set for myself was to arrange my coding better. Use multiple event sheets instead of having everything on just one. <em>Yeah yeah I know, huge rookie mistake, but hey I'm learning still!\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0-\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A to move Left.</strong></li><li><strong>D to move right.</strong></li><li><strong>Spacebar to jump.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>That's all I'm gonna tell for now. It dodgeball, you know how to play dodgeball right?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A message from the creator\u00a0 - As with all my projects there are plans to improve and add more content. Please leave a comment or suggestion.\u00a0 I don't think there are any bugs at this time, but please let me know if you find one.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T04:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac3b0f98ed6c6ac1fe2e0b256b72c09e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
