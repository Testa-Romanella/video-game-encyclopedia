His task is to survive. That is why the player needs to get everything he needs: food, boards for building houses, sticks and various minerals to create things with which the player will extract resources, and so on.</p>\n<p>When the source island runs out of resources, the player will have to create a flying ball on which he will reach other islands. But there are not only ordinary islands, on which everything is green and beautiful, there are also dangerous islands: fiery, poisoned, dried up and completely frozen. In addition to the usual island, there are also small islands surrounding the usual one; on them you can find dungeons with useful and not very things.
