The key feature (pun very much intended!) is that the most aspects of the game serve a dual purpose - for example, the key helps the player reach their goal by unlocking the door to the next room, plus it can also be used as a weapon against the other player. Addition death, whilst normally a setback, can give an advantage if you block a crucial throw. This keeps the action fast, frantic and - most importantly - fun.</p>\n<p>Everything you see and hear in Keys to Castle Lockdown was created by the good and not-so-good folks at Broken Lantern games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/075f4ee57ef52f2bc119956db77c05c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broken Lantern"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
