So we used the characters slots at their limits and sometimes for bigger characters we used more than a slot.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In rpg usually you got experience point or buy equipement in order to increase your party stats. This can be entertaining at the beginning, but later it becomes repetitive. For this reason, even if we kept the experience and equipment system, we decided to put in the game a way to customize your hero to give him different skills and map abilities in order to reach different zones (like castlevania or metroid).\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another weak points of rpgmaker videogames is that being them \"free games\" there's no manual or other things. Plus they lacks menu that usually are present in professional games. MWRPG has an online guide.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Last, a common rpg game engine will become rapidly repetitive and unappealing. Due to this MWRPG has many platform elements and minigames.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In order to advance in the game is more important to find secrets and upgrade items more than levelling up: in this way you have not to waste an entire day in fighting monsters.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>FINAL WORS: READ PLEASE !!!\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>IT'S IMPORTANT !!!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please feel free to comment the game on the forum as much as you want.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Your feedback is important for us.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In any case, to simplify our work for a future release of a version 1.1 of the game, you should send your comments to us to the following email address:\r\n  </p>\n<p>info AT monsterworldrpg DOT com\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance and enjoy our game!!!\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f5faf73a72b3c0e30e8ca43311a9771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monster World RPG"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
