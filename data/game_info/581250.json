(Denmark). <br/>#2 in Top Free, Game, Board, and Dice Categories! (Austria). <br/>Top 10 in the Board Category in Italy, Canada, &amp; UK. <br/><br/>Will YOU close the box?<br/><br/>CLOSE THE WHAT?<br/><br/>CloseTheBox is a realistic Shut the box game. It's a casual board game where you need to shut all the tiles with two dices.<br/>As simple as that. <br/><br/>Top 10 in the Board/Dice games category in many countries.<br/><br/>More than 10 000 games were played in the first 24hours!<br/><br/>\"Best game to play in the bathroom\" -Thomas D <br/><br/>FEATURES <br/><br/>- Almost a realistic design.<br/>- Sound effects.<br/>- Help mode. (or the \"Don't think, just keep trying\" mode. For the lazy minds).<br/>- Fran\u00e7ais/English, more languages to come soon!<br/>- It took me 134 times before I (without any cheat), closed it.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>The rules of the classic game are quite simple.<br/>You have in your possession two dices and a wooden box (let's pretend that it is!). <br/>Your goal is to roll the dices to 'shut', or 'close' the box.<br/>To do that, you need to roll the dices, and the total sum of the two will make a total that you can equalize by closing two of the shutters. <br/>For example, if you have 8 in total, you can close 7+1, 6+2, 5+3, 5+2+1<br/>Once a slider is shut, it stays shut for the whole game. <br/>Many variants were invented to that game later on (coming in the next updates). <br/>The game continues until all of the sliders are shut or until an impossible roll occurs.<br/>If the player manages to close the box (the probability is pretty low), he has the privilege to write on the 'Box of Fame'. <br/><br/>Good luck! <br/><br/>-S\u00e9raphin<br/><br/>Feedback : iscales@me.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T13:12:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/048e76a20948cadff91f04fb5ee1e04e.jpg", "website": "http://closethebox.phin.fr", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Seraphin Hochart"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Seraphin Hochart"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
