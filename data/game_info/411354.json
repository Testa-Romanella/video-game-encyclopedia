The premise is that there is a ball that has to reach the bottom of the screen. In its path, there are obstacles that the player has to help to clear.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was \"COLD\", and I tried to cover it with mechanics involving ice/water/air currents, etc. The looks are tiled pixel art. It is my first approach to Unity in 2D, also to photoshop, and I think it looks pretty solid for what it is. All the graphics are original for this game.</p>\n<p>All the sound effects were\u00a0made with the awesome sfxr. There is no music at all.</p>\n<p>The game features 11 levels. Hope you enjoy them. Please leave a comment with your feedback if you wish, it really helps ;)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing this!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:49:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7cc822b8d1e22ada2bf301dacfa4ea7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fran Bosquet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
