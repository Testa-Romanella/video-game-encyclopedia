{"id": 2272, "slug": "arma-tactics", "name": "Arma Tactics", "name_original": "Arma Tactics", "description": "<p>ARMA Tactics is a standalone spin-off of the ARMA mobile tactics series. While being set in the same universe as its predecessors, the game features a dramatically different type of gameplay.</p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>The player takes control over a squad of four Special Forces operatives in the modern world. He or she can view them from the top-down &quot;bird&#39;s eye&quot; view in a 3D environment. The scope of a camera is very limited, however. Each character has special skills that can be improved when the character levels up using an RPG-like mechanic of experience points.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The combat and movements in ARMA Tactics are turn-based. Each unit has two action points. They can be spent on movement, healing, attacks, or preparations for an enemy attack. For example, the player can spend a point to order his or her soldier to fire upon seeing an enemy without waiting for his or her turn.</p>\n<p>ARMA Tactics relies heavily on the &quot;invisible dice.&quot; A lot of things in the game are randomized, and both the player&#39;s and enemy soldiers can miss their target from the point-blank distance if the game says so.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>The game has two modes. In the story mode, the team completes a series of missions against Islamic terrorists in Africa. The plot is delivered through cutscenes between missions. The other mode offers the player to complete the randomly generated missions. There&#39;s no multiplayer mode.</p>", "metacritic": 47, "released": "2013-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T20:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/128ef824b918a2b0bdf9c3a5ccc96a06.jpeg", "website": "http://www.armatactics.com/", "rating": 1.94, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 37, "owned": 953, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 14, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 535, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Bohemia Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bohemia Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
