Battles in your tabletop are decided by luck and dice rolls...or are they? Secretly fudge the rolls to tailor the game based on your players' idea of fun! Can you entertain them all?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>- Every player around the table will react differently to events in the battle. Clicking on their face will open the Player Card to know their preferences.</p>\n<p>- Use the dice at the bottom of the screen to replace any dice (inclunding the enemy's) on the board to get your preferred outcome. Be careful, you can only fudge 3 rolls per turn!</p>\n<p>- Each unit uses different types of dice based on their actions.</p>\n<p>- Each unit has a D20 (hexagon) to determine if their hit will land. Additionally they use a combination of either D6 (square) or D4 (triangle) to deal damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- To land a hit, units need to roll with their D20 (hexagon) a number higher than the opponent's Defense Value. The Dragon's Defense is 10. The Heroes' Defense is 8. Notice the D20s color on the board to foresee the outcome. Keep in mind that players hate to miss attacks!</p>\n<p>- Very high rolls will score a critical hit, dealing double damage (highlighted in yellow D20s). - While attacking, the Dragon additionally rolls a D4 to decide which hero to attack in a clockwise direction. You can change that D4 too!</p>\n<p>- Once the battle is concluded, the players' Fun Score will be calculated. How good of a Game Master are you?</p>\n\n<p>Developed By:<br/></p>\n<p>Gianluca\u00a0\"HiZed\" Bardaro</p>\n<p>Danilo \"Asdaroth\"\u00a0D'Alessandro</p>\n<p>Davide \"Zelgas\" D'Alessandro</p>\n<p>Music By:</p>\n<p>Thomas Thoreau -\u00a0thomasthoreau.com/main</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T19:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3eafd4fe086a49de7d1e84be3aef5121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zelgas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
