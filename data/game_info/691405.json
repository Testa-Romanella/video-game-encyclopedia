Spit your dangerous fire to grill (and kill) them. As you kill more and more enemies the range of your attacks will increase, but also get slower. You can split your player character into smaller ones and have more and more hydras, but you also have to control each one on your own at the same time with different keys, so be careful that you don't run out of fingers!<br/><br/>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Split player character:<br/>SPACE then left click on hydra to select, place with left click.
