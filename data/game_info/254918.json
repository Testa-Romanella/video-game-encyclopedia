This will obviously get reset when the deck is shuffled.  There are 2 other options to help you remember the cards used, you can tap on any score and find out what cards were used in that hand.  Also you can try the 'Suggested Play' by swiping over the example cards and tapping on the 'i', this will give you Odds on getting the hand and also which cards to keep and discard, you don't have to follow these suggestions, they are a guide for one type of play.<br/><br/>All played cards and turn information is passed to all players including when the deck is shuffled.<br/><br/>As it is quite difficult to get all the possible Poker scoring combinations you can also score part combinations or partial hands.<br/>e.g. a pair is a partial 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, full house etc.<br/>These partials will only score the face value of the cards that make up the partial, if however you complete the full card combination the face value is then subject to a multiplier, so you get 100's instead of 10's of points.<br/><br/>Get in touch if you have ideas as these might be included as I update in the future.<br/><br/>I believe this is a unique game and as such I am open to suggestions on how it might be tailored?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for lots of updates over the months, loads of things planned.<br/><br/>NOTE:<br/>Next update is the multiplayer version.<br/>Odds values not quite right, will be corrected in the next version.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/417be114962a46509cf1505e3a77334b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Tracy"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Paul Tracy"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
