This is a condensed vertical slice of what might make up a full version of this game.</p>\n<p>When an earthquake strikes Hyperion Research Station, the alien lifeforms being studied\u00a0- the Orboids - are unleashed from containment. As the seemingly last survivor, your goal is to escape using the various items and upgrades scattered across the station.</p>\n<p>The upgrades you find all enhance your ability to navigate the environment and fight enemies. Stylish aerial battles are encouraged, as you'll deal more damage the longer you can stay airborne without getting hit.</p>\n<p>Keyboard and mouse is recommended, but controller support is also available.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05668d8c5dd5e37bbd420ec9a100abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["splemb"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
