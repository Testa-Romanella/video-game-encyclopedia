I've decided it's time to upload this project to WebGL.</p>\n<p>The concept of this game is to defeat the enemies with the cubes surrounding you using the physics system of the Unity engine. Each enemy itself also controlled by the physic system.<br/> <br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Use WASD and space for movement and jump.\u00a0<br/>Use left mouse button to pull a cube and than press left mouse again to fire the cube you just pulled. <br/>Use right mouse button to stop a cube from moving. <br/><br/><strong>Enemies:</strong> <br/>The games present 3 types of enemies you can fight in each stage:<br/><br/><strong>Armored enemy </strong>- defeat him by removing his armor. <br/><strong>Spherical enemy</strong> - defeat him by throwing him out of the stage. <br/><strong>Flying enemy</strong> - defeat him by hit him enough times. <br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong> <br/><strong>Amir Buganov</strong> for the modeling and animation. <br/><strong>Nataly Lepler</strong> for texturing, you can visit her artstation page: https://www.artstation.com/natalylepler <br/><strong>Unity asset store</strong> for providing good and free assets (like the skybox) :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113e4b785ed410bc45162ba610fbdcaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UdiBer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
