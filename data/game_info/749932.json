Please keep that in mind!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>You play as John Blanc, a narcissistic convict, who finds himself trapped in a strange pocket dimension. Soon after his arrival, he is greeted by a former cell neighbor and executed serial killer, Chase Colt. While Chase claims that John has already died, this quickly turns out to be a malicious lie to keep John trapped in this world. Will he be able to figure out a way to escape, or will he die to the many tricks of this wicked place?</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Mistrick was made within one month for the Yandere Jam 2022</p>\r\nCONTENT WARNINGContains depiction and mentions of blood, violence, murder and kidnapping\r\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>It features:</p>\n<p>- 3 Endings</p>\n<p>-\u00a013 unique ways to die</p>\n<p>- 40-60 minutes of gameplay</p>\n<p>- 5 CGs</p><p>- Available languages: English, German (Windows only)</p>\n<p>If you get stuck please consult the walkthrough which you can download further down :) Alternatively both Lola and Chase give you in game hints through their dialogue.<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Mistrick is a spin-off to my other game 'Misfiction'. It is not necessary to play Misfiction to understand Mistrick, since the events of Misfiction are retold through a intro cutscene (And not all that important later on). That being said, if you still plan on playing Misfiction I would advise you to do that first, or alternatively skip the intro cutscene of Mistrick, as it does contain spoilers for Misfiction.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Let's play/Streaming guidelines:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to stream/Let's play this game.
