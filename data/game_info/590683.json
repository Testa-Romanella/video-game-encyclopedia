(jfc132)", "description": "<p>*Video contains spoilers for puzzles.\u00a0</p><p>** To play, the game requires Mouse and Keyboard plus an Xbox one Controller for the second player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A whacky split screen puzzle game.</p>\n<p>Players must find each other while working together to get through a series of puzzles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See how quick you can get through the levels and earn stars based on your performance. Spend your stars on in game cosmetics for your characters where you can show off a flavor of your personality!</p>\n<p>This project was my first team based project in the Unreal Engine. It was also my first time being a QA lead as usually I am the Level Designer. The team set out to create a fun split screen puzzle game comparable to Human Falls Flat and Fall Guys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the QA Lead, I had to learn exactly what the role entails. I learned I had to actively playtest the game as thoroughly as possible while taking useful notes. Marking any bugs, notifying the team of the bugs as well as prioritizing and assigning the bugs out to the team.\u00a0 I also had to schedule and organize external playtests, record the tests while taking notes and lastly creating surveys for the external play testers\u00a0to fill out after the playtest. I was also the assistant level designer, I created the Level Select area as well as well as doing the polishing and implementation of art/assets into the levels.\u00a0\u00a0Please see below the team and their roles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Amber Leigh - Production Lead/ Audio\u00a0Assistant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ravina Sahota - Design Lead / Art Assistant.</p>\n<p>Abi Saunders - Programming Lead / Production Assistant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joao Mondego - Art and Audio Lead/ Programmer Assistant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jordan Clements - QA\u00a0 Lead/ Level designer Assistant.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T10:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c7888c2d4af0c9b3a84ca67194c31cec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFC132"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
