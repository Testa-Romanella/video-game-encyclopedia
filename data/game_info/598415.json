Venture in the world of Koinonia in which you have to face a coming-of-age ritual, time-keepers, finding or maybe even rescueing a loved one and lots of other things.</p>\n<p>Time Traveller was created during the nonbinary game jam 2021. It was written, drawn and coded by a team with a majority of queer and enby devs.</p>\n<p>Currently only the first chapter is ready to play, but we intend to work on it after the jam, to make you experience the full story.</p>\n<p>[Warning Spoilers] In the beginning of our development process we had the idea to make a story exploring the concepts of queer time and heterotemporality. For many queer people events and milestones that are presented as \"normal\" by most media and the society around us do not allways happen at the points in time or the order they are usually associated with or at all. Progress is not always linear in queer time and experiences can vary a lot from one person to the next. Our game is meant to portray this in a very literal sense while at the same time being a fun adventure with small puzzles and an engaging story. Due to the time constraints we and a few unforseeable obstacles we are only able to release chapter 1 at this time, which will only hint at the themes discussed above, while a deeper exploration of the concepts will follow with the release of the subsequent chapters.
