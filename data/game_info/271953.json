When you <strong>discover</strong> the game for the first time, it starts. \u00a0If the game enters the state of <strong>solved</strong>, \u00a0then it unlocks links to other games! \u00a0In a way, we traverse the web like this through links. \u00a0The only difference is that we don\u2019t need to \u201csolve\u201d a webpage.</p>\n<p>Imagine if each game in an itch.io Game Jam is a <strong>node</strong>. \u00a0If each game had a way of declaring its state as \u201csolved\u201d, then you could make a graph-based adventure game using all of the Game Jam\u2019s games! \u00a0All you would need is a <strong>set of solvable games</strong>. \u00a0These could be labeled manually by human players, and then fed into a program that randomly generates graphs and paths through the games!</p>\n<p>If nothing else, it might create a fun way to navigate through and play tons of new itch.io games!</p>\n\n\r\nFeedback plz =)\u00a0\r\n<p>I like getting any kind of feedback or criticism.\u00a0 So, if you are reading this right now, please feel free to comment!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a246c2bbe09d36d981e8a46704e2a0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["synack"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
