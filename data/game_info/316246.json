{"id": 316246, "slug": "lust-doll-plus", "name": "Lust Doll Plus", "name_original": "Lust Doll Plus", "description": "<p>Lust Doll Plus is set in a post-apocalyptic semi-modern/future world, where you start alone and confused in a dangerous place, with literally nothing (not even clothes on your back), and go on to carve out a piece of the world for yourself. There'll be a main storyline to follow, but the emphasis is on it being an open world game where you just screw around and have fun.</p>\n<p>This is a remaster of Lust Doll (downloadable here: https://indivi.itch.io/lustdoll) which I spent three years developing! If you've never played, do check it out!</p>\n<p>At the start, you can customize your character's body to your tastes/preferences. Compared to the original, there's now vastly more customizations to choose from, such as height, furry/human body, type of cock (horse/dog), kemonomimi ears and tail, wings, teeth, even the colour of the inside of your mouth (for some reason!) You choose who you want to be at the beginning, but your body can be changed over the course of the game. You'll also find plenty of interesting, fancy, and/or sexy clothing/toys to wear. One big thing that the original game lacked is the ability to specifically equip things to your genitalia. So, if for example, you want to go through the game with a giant, vibrating dildo up your butt, that'll definitely be a thing you can do.</p>\n<p>You'll also be able to control much of the content you see in the game. For example, if you wish for your character to have sex with only males or only females, or if you don't want to see a particular kink, then you can do that. Admittedly, the original game tilted heavily towards female partners and subbe content. This time around, I'll be making things more equal, so that those that enjoy male partners and domme content will have vastly more to experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Kinks that can be toggled:</strong><br/>Female Partners<br/>Male Partners<br/>Traps<br/>Cumflation<br/>M2F Transformations<br/>Cock Transformations<br/>Mega-sized Cock<br/>Breast Transformations<br/>Mega-sized Breasts<br/>Pregnancy<br/>Tickle Torture<br/>Futanari<br/>Futa Balls<br/>Limb Detachment<br/>Foot Fetish<br/>Furry<br/>Genital Piercings</p>\n<p><strong>More General Kinks:</strong><br/>Orgasm Denial<br/>Bondage<br/>Sex Machines<br/>BDSM/ Sex 'Games'/owning your own private dungeon<br/>Creampie<br/>Public Humiliation/ Exposure<br/>Breast Milking/ Nipple Play<br/>Hypnotism/Mind Control<br/>Orgasm Overload<br/>Parasitic/Living Clothes<br/>Anal/ Spanking<br/>Loving Femdom/Dominant Girls<br/>Slavery</p>\n<p>(Since the game is still quite fresh, most of these kinks aren't in the game yet. That'll definitely change with time!)</p>\n<p>You have eight stats to manage:</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> - How strong you are. Influences weapon damage and actions requiring lots of power.</p>\n<p><strong>Mystic</strong> - How in tune you are with supernatural/ metaphysical elements, and how good you are at resisting them.</p>\n<p><strong>Nimble</strong> - How good you are at doing intricate actions, such as dancing, picking locks, escaping binds.</p>\n<p><strong>Body</strong> - How much punishment your body can shake off, your ability to enter poisonous environments, how quickly you fold under torture.</p>\n<p><strong>Speech</strong> - How good you are at understanding others and convincing them towards your point of view.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> - How much intellect you have, which can allow you to interpret or figure out something that you've never seen before.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> - How good you are at seeing hidden things, such as secret passages, places that you can climb up, traps, hidden people.</p>\n<p><strong>Erotic</strong> - How sexy you are, and how good you are at dominating others sexually.</p>\n<p>Each of these stats grow the more that you use them. They can also be affected by your current states. For example, if you're drunk, your senses and nimbleness might drop significantly, but your speech and erotic might get a nice boost.</p>\n<p>I also want to highlight some specific differences from the older version. As mentioned, there'll be more male NPC's and domme chances (though it'll still likely skew more towards female NPC's just cause that's easier to write for me.)</p>\n<p>I'll also be putting more emphasis on a pregnancy system, and being able to be impregnated/impregnated others, which'll go well with having more male NPC's.</p>\n<p>Also planning on a slavery system, and being able to capture/imprison enemies for... 'fun times'.</p>\n<p>Finally, I'm also putting in support for furry content. The player and certain NPC's and enemies can have furry versions of themselves. For those who aren't into that, you can disable it, and it'll never show up for you in game.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m running a patreon, if you would like to support me!<br/>https://www.patreon.com/indivi</p>\n<p>Other places you can find my stuff:<br/>https://discord.gg/nKQGYKk<br/>https://twitter.com/indivigames<br/>https://indivigames.newgrounds.com<br/>https://gamejolt.com/@IndiviGames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T03:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b32/b32b0291501144005b198519cc746419.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["indivi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
