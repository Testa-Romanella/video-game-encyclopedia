Punishment from a higher being, the Elders had said. Eighty years ago, it swept through the world, silent and merciless, turning life to dust.</p>\n<p>A curse followed shortly after: the inability to dream.\r\n</p>\n<p>It was cruel in its inevitability. Slow and  patient in its approach \u2013 taking hold as one stepped into adolescence. Dreams gradually dimmed, then quieted altogether by the time they reached the age of fourteen. Sleep became silent. A yawning void bereft of color and sound.</p>\n<p>You used to dream of dragons, underwater cities and forest spirits. Of music and flight and impossibility. Now, sleep is nothing but a muted state of being. All that is left are memories, flickering vestiges of color, but those will begin to fade too.\r\n</p>\n<p>You remember the anger \u2013 how easily it came. Fast and hot and helpless the day your dreams finally vanished. Fourteen years old, but still very much a child.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Play through the eyes of Dan-bi, a young adventurer, who leaves their village to search for the truth behind the suffering inflicted on their people. The world is not kind, this much is known, but the reasons may be darker \u2013 and perhaps, simpler \u2013 than you think.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T11:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/830511e2828423b7042670d6c1bed409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hyphenQ"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
