Try reviewing the following information:</p>\n<ul><li>When you move (not swap), you drag a path of organelles behind you. The highlighted slime shows which tiles will be dragged! This can be used to position organelles strategically and quickly.</li><li>To learn what something is, e[x]amine it.</li><li>Pressing space to pass a turn or luring enemies can break an otherwise impenetrable formation.</li><li>In the early game, it is easy to find new base organelles but hard to find crafting materials. This inverts as time goes on.</li><li>Find the right balance between combat, exploration, and organelle management for your play-style; all of these cost time and come with different risks and rewards.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Game by Vectis<br/>Extensive playtesting, design, and support from JackNine<br/>Further playtesting from Qu and Decinym<br/>Engine: https://github.com/FaronBracy/RogueSharp<br/>Font:\u00a0https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod/blob/develop/data/fonts/terminal12x12_gs_ro.png<br/>.NET 4.6.1 by Microsoft</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab3/ab32e7aa2fe370f0f6e5a24071ae40ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vectis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
