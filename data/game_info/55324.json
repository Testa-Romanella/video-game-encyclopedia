It was hosted on GEnie and used that service as a server for client software running on a variety of personal computers available in that era. It underwent continual improvement through its decade-long lifetime with Kesmi, appearing on new platforms and host services. Electronic Arts purchased Air Warrior in 1999, and became provider of the game, but it was discontinued in 2001.</p>\n<p>Air Warrior was one of the first massive online games, hosting hundreds of users during busy periods. It inspired WarBirds, which in turn inspired to Aces High. Today there are a number of similar games, like WarThunder, most of them based on a freemium model.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/211471d5e3b2d167c354ca0e8434e7a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Kesmai"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Konami", "Interactive Magic", "I-Magic"], "esrb_rating": null}
