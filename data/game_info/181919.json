Thus are confined to your bedroom.</p><p>Then the real tragedy hit.</p><p>Your Videogame Guy ran out of batteries.</p><p>Now you must risk your life to find more so that you can survive the weekend. You know that Grandma keeps extras in the house somewhere, but you can't remember where... they could be in:</p><p>- The Kitchen Counter</p><p>- The Curio Cabinet in the Living Room</p><p>- The Living Room Closet</p><p>- The Hall Closet</p><p>- Grandma's Nightstand</p><p>You need to search these places, find which one has the batteries, and then get back to your room. And at no point can you let Grandma see you!</p><p>Keep in mind that Grandma tends to roam the house, sometimes erratically. This is because of her failing mental health, and totally not due to the wonky, hack-job path finding she uses.</p><p>Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/9619de425c933bc9c82eb269d1e90b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jw608"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
