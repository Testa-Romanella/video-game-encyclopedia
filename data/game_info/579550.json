To guarantee victory, you first have to destroy the enemy's (Territory Control Center) and replace them with yours which are necessary for having revenue of resources. After capturing all territories, the enemy's main base shield will go down allowing you to strike and destroy them for good.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Hybrid Gameplay</strong><br/>Yes, You can build your own army but you will not fight with your own body. Instead, through devices that gives you control over your robotic army units described as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Strategy Drone Device</strong><br/>\tThis device allows you to build and control your entire army from the sky. By calling up space ships from the mother ship in outer space. Depending on your offensive or defensive plan, build your army and form combat groups as you wish. order them to move or defend or attack. <br/>\tWarning: commander drones can be seen by the enemy army and destroyed instantly. Be careful where are you flying.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><strong>Avatar Control Device:</strong><br/>\tThis device allows you to control any unit within your army.

If you want the electronic shield back. You must have at least one (Territory Control Center).<br/>\tNOTE: (Territory Control Center) is the only way of supporting the base shield. When all centers are lost, it endangers the main base.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Where are the (Territory Control Station)s kept?</strong><br/>You're not in control of the <strong>GCCS</strong> (Global Command And Control System), the <strong>GCCS</strong> are in the hive in outer space. Sent only when your control of the <strong>Resource Zone</strong> (sector) is complete and secure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The resource zone</strong> (Sectors) is a huge mine deep underground that automatically extracts <strong>(Resource Packet)</strong> and sends them to the war factories and <strong>CS</strong> (Commander Ship). That landed on it from space. And this mine will only work for your army through the GCC. So factories manufacture the military units for your army and land on the battlefield. The resource zone also provides additional numbers for the security forces. This allows you to create additional military units in your army.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <strong>Resource Packet</strong> contain materials and energy. which is the currency used in battel. it's used in building military units through the war factories, and can also upgrade your war factories to increase the efficiency of the military units, and can be claimed by sectors, and it's also used to call Defenders.<br/><br/> <strong>Territory forces</strong> When you're in control of the Sector.
