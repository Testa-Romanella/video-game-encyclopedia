You\u2019ll start in the outskirts of the Laetus grove, only to find that all is not what it seems - strange hostile dwellers with wooden bodies and vacant eyes now patrol this land...<br />\nLock-on to enemies for a more tactical approach; parry, dodge and counter-attack while always keeping your stamina in check as you deliver deadly blows and combos. Prepare your battles ahead by using the Elk secondary inventory to store a variety of short and long range weapons, defense gear, and potions.<br />\nSet in a far-reaching and interconnected semi-open world, you\u2019ll explore a divided kingdom once ruled by a warring King. Tragedy struck when his beloved Queen died during childbirth - the royal family was irreversibly broken and the King\u2019s sons drifted apart, each claiming a piece of the realm.
