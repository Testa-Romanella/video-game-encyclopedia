To do this, he will have to debug the games and face major bugs in the games to finally arrive at his opponent: Bugosaur. In the end, Lardon manages to convince Bugosaur to stop creating bugs but to collaborate. With experience, is it possible to surpass the masters in our field? The player moves the character through the level in the same way as Mario. If the level is too complicated or if Lardon does not have the necessary skills, he can stop the level and program his own skills: creation of a dash, a melee attack or the possibility of creating a weapon to throw projectil. Please note that the player will not be able to program all the skills when he wishes, but collects programming points in the levels. He can also use his skills to improve the skills already obtained (dash further / faster, weapons throwing further). The player will be able to choose the order in which he decides to program his skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:35:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/824957867972c0a08a7f394eb78b9bfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brieux"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
