Shoutout to <strong>CodingFlow</strong> for the Inspiration for this! He has amazing tutorials. Some code is \"burrowed\"from him.\u00a0 But the other codes are by me. Yep,\u00a0 his code was a lit bit outdated.\u00a0 Just a bit, but I managed to fix them, causing them to be my code. I decided to name it after <strong>Zelda, so</strong>\u00a0I named it <strong>lenda</strong> but since our mascot is <strong>Frigga frag</strong>, we have him in our name. Donating helps a lot! It's your choice to <strong>donate</strong>! It will help me make more levels and sequels! Currently working on a 3d shooter\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T13:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/6414a3a780ee5b937349ff2c5043cf74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rocker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
