You are about to do the usual zombie business - harvesting brains of course. To finish a level you need to harvest ALL brains available! There is a catch, though. Every brain donor becomes a zombie. And as a proper zombie, it suddenly starts feeling a need for fresh brains. So the more brains you harvest, the more competitors you have!\r\n</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s one more thing - for some reason, every zombie and human in this game loves to dance. So everyone moves automatically to the beat of the music. Have fun :D\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for Ludum Dare #52 Compo, but this\u00a0is post-jam version.\u00a0You can see the original version here:\u00a0https://jhysek.itch.io/brains</p>\r\nHow do humans work?\r\n<p>Humans are funny creatures.
