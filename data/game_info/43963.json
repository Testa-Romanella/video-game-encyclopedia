How I've missed you. I recall the many memories we've shared, your efforts to rescue me, with the uttermost bliss... You're my beloved knight, you know? My beautiful shining prince, as precious as the glow of a baby star. But it has been a while since we last saw each other, huh? Perhaps you've forgotten me. But do not fear, for I will hold out for you, my dear.<br/><br/>But now's not the time for idle memories, for at this very moment you're sinking. Are you still unable to see, even now? If so, then this is quite a predicament. Little Marshmallow, if you don't stop diving deeper, well... Who knows what might happen to you, or who might just take an interest. Like a moth to the flame... But oh how excited this makes me feel, absolutely mesmerizing and drawing out an even more curious side of myself which makes me want to explore you all over...<br/><br/>Still, you must remember; you're not alone. You may always seek help from others, or you may even try to lead others to being helped. Helping others is rarely a bad thing, and while I admit I may grow a bit jealous as you're giving so much attention to others, I do remember how you've helped me in the past and so I shall hold my tongue. Bite down into it, chew and tear it apart until it bleeds. We may share in these revels later, but for now you must stop sinking.<br/><br/>Or maybe it is your intention to sink...?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/068f072931b74205bd565cd227fbb3f3.jpg", "website": "http://yaigameworks.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yai Gameworks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yai Gameworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
