These conditions will change your characters&#39; portraits, their statistics, and sometimes even their class!<br />\nIn addition, almost none of these conditions are strictly negative! A character may be turned to stone, but a passage may need you to place their statue to proceed. There may be a small hole that only a party of miniaturized characters can pass through. A character may be transformed into an onahole, but you can use it on enemies to help defeat them!<br />\nYou can keep track of all of these status conditions in the Status Journal, which updates whenever you experience a new one!A Wide World of Possibilities!<br />\nTake the three starting party members and seven more that can be recruited - each with a unique base class such as Mage, Warrior, or Rogue - and add the variety that comes with class-changing status effects, and the possible combinations for your party are practically infinite! With your chosen party, face off against memorable bosses and fight your way through over a dozen dungeons with unique mechanics!<br />\nLevel up and spend Job Points to unlock skills in the order you choose - some of which will still be kept even after changing classes!Bad End Cutscenes!<br />\nLosing or surrendering to an enemy will trigger a Bad End cutscene, featuring a wide variety of fetishes, including mind control, petrification, enslavement, encasement, possession, gyaru/bimbofication, time stopping, corruption, and many more!<br />\nGetting a Game Over this way only sets you back slightly, as you&#39;re not forced to reload a save file. And after that, you can re-watch that Bad End cutscene as much as you like! In addition, defeating a boss unlocks Bad Ends you haven&#39;t seen in that area!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-29T14:06:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/459/4596146090cdd0665c3ba74a7a0aa0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vhiel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vhiel"], "esrb_rating": null}
