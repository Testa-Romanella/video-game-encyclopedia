I\u00a0enjoyed playtesting it so much that I\u00a0decided to make it my first itch.io release!</p>\n<p>Livestream where I\u00a0developed v1.0:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLALx9d_ycE5uirkxkRsLFUqIMdwJptzIB</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://gitlab.com/bradenbest/free-rings</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>* <strong>space</strong> to put down ring early (or <strong>click</strong>\u00a0the center ring)</p>\n<p>* <strong>click and\u00a0drag</strong> rings to move them</p>\n<p>* <strong>T</strong> to bring up theme switcher (colorblind players will like this)</p>\n<p>* <strong>R</strong> to restart after game over</p>\n<p>* <strong>P </strong>to pause (or <strong>unfocus</strong> the main play area)</p><p>* <strong>1 - 6 </strong>to automatically send the ring currently held by the mouse\u00a0to the corresponding ring stack (v1.5.3). I've been wanting to implement a QoL feature like\u00a0this for a while. It's a little weird and takes getting used to, but let's face it, mouse controls aren't great for non-FPS games. Try it out, you might end up preferring it.</p>\n<p>How to play: Stack smaller rings onto bigger rings, bigger clears get bigger points, but don't get too greedy. If the ring on the top of the stack is the same size or smaller than the ring that falls on top, it's game over. 10 clears = 1 round. New rounds clear all the already-dropped rings off the board. Use this to your advantage.</p>\n<p>This game is a lot harder than the original flash game. The typical run is\u00a0expected to\u00a0 end at round 8-10 rather than round 15-20. The pace picks up faster and I spent a lot of time polishing little things.</p>\n<p>If you get an anticheat notice but you didn't cheat, let me know and try to give steps to reproduce the false positive.
