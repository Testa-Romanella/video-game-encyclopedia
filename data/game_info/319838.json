As this journey gets darker, you will have to be able to tell the plague's symptoms -or the whole city will perish. If you're not sure about someone's fate you will be able to condemn them, but be careful; for the Hipocratic Oath lays heavy on the Doctor's mind... and you might eventually get crazy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c617692ca516121efdeeb38653df7836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LisdexiaEstudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
