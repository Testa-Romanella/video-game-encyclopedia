Towers cost energy which is generated by <strong>generators</strong>. Generators generate power for each ground tile in their influence radius. Buildings can only be placed in the power field  of generators (or the core). Additionally, towers can only be placed on tiles with a socket on them. Spawners spawn  stronger enemies over time. To prevent them from overwhelming the defences, spawners can be destroyed by placing a generator close to one. Destroying some spawners makes the map expand. Survive as long as possible and get a new highscore.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Camera movement</li><li>1234 - Select building types</li><li>LMB - Build / Select</li><li>RMB - Cancel Build / Deselect </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things made before the jam:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The GameJam kit - https://epicgames.app.box.com/v/GameJamKit</li><li>\u00a0Dekar Font - https://www.fontfabric.com/dekar-free-font/</li><li>Laser Particles from one of my previous gamejam games</li><li>The camera controls from an old unpublished RTS thing I made</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f52ea6c85ec36b44e70f50cd85ae375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vovin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
