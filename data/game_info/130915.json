I've been working on this project for many months; it's my biggest project yet, and I'm so glad to finally have a full version to release.</p>\n<p>Clamber 2 is a puzzle-platformer where you play as a square trying to get to the end of each level. However, the twist is that you can press a certain button to become a block that you can jump on later. This simple mechanic is combined with a few others to create a platformer that requires some skill to execute, but is mostly focused on solving puzzles using the game's main mechanic. This is the first official version of the game, which currently features 20 levels. If you have any feedback for the game, feel free to post it in the comments. I'm very open to suggestions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The linux version is currently untested. If you have linux and try the game, please tell me how it worked in the comments.</p>\n<p>This game should be able to be played partially with an Xbox controller when on Windows\u00a0(and I recommend you do so if you can), but it's certainly keyboard-compatible otherwise.</p>\n<p>A huge thank you to my art designer (and also mother), who did all of the play sprites and some other pieces, as well as three fellow student playtesters. You've all helped me make the game the way it is now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00c3d8de45f706aec21a55ebb1d884ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ComputerCow"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
