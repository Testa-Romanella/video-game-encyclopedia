After the leakage of the device from the Corporation lab it fell into the hands of ordinary people and began to spread very quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIn a short time almost everyone on Earth had the QMRD. People cloned everything that came under their hands: money, food, energy and even themselves. Very soon, the world plunged into chaos.
