Results: sort of got there! I had to cut almost all the text, and butcher my code into one-letter variable names, but the basics are there in 557 characters\u00a0:)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play: pick a character and choose a conversational topic to discuss. If you pick three topics that are actually interesting to the character in a row, you get a \"perfect teatime\". That's it. That's the game.</p>\n<p>Because this moment\u00a0naturally occurs about a quarter of the way into the\u00a0story, you won't be able to do particularly well in this version if you aren't familiar with the conversational preferences of the characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I had more characters, it would be trivial to add more topics, more characters, tea selection, multi-tea-party play etc. If anyone wants to use my code to take a crack at doing so, please go right ahead!</p><p><strong>Here's the entire source code; load this into the Inky Editor if you want to play/hack on it:</strong></p>\r\nLIST C=Sylvain,Edelgard,Bernadetta<br/>LIST T=sweets,school,romance,battle<br/>VAR H=0<br/>VAR S=(romance,battle)<br/>VAR E=(battle,school)<br/>VAR B=(school,sweets)<br/>VAR O=0<br/>-&gt;a\r\n=a<br/>Tea with<br/>+\u2026{C(1)}[?]! -&gt;b(S)<br/>+\u2026{C(2)}[?]! -&gt;b(E)<br/>+\u2026{C(3)}[?]! -&gt;b(B)\r\n=b(t)<br/>~H=0<br/>~T -= LIST_ALL(T)<br/>~T += t<br/>~O=t<br/>-&gt;c\r\n=c<br/>~temp i=0<br/>-(top)<br/>{LIST_COUNT(T) &lt; 3:<br/> ~T += T(RANDOM(1, LIST_COUNT(LIST_ALL(T))))<br/> -&gt;top<br/>}<br/>{CHOICE_COUNT() &lt; 3:<br/> ~i++<br/> {T?T(i): &lt;-d(T(i))}<br/> -&gt;top<br/>}\r\n=d(s)<br/>+ [Talk about {s}]<br/>The conversation got<br/>{O?s:\u00a0<br/> ~H++<br/> &lt;&gt; lively!<br/> {H&gt;2:Perfect teatime!|-&gt;c}<br/>-else:<br/> &lt;&gt; awkward :(<br/>}<br/>-&gt;a\r\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:40:37", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chance Agency"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
