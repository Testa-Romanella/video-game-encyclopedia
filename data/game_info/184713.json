The bigger the loops, the more points you can get. You start with a random piece. Move, rotate and place it where you like. But be careful, the grid is not unlimited and you never know which piece will come next. Test your brain with this fascinating casual puzzle.\r\n</p><p>Game engine: <strong>Unity3D</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/41274d9cd635fa97b0346936afe62018.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicol\u00e1s Michelini"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
