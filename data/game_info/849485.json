{"id": 849485, "slug": "void-eagle", "name": "Void Eagle", "name_original": "Void Eagle", "description": "Void Eagle is a single player space racer that requires you to dodge obstacles at breakneck speeds while you try to make it out alive. Will you make it and post the fastest time, or go down in a fiery explosion. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnly the bravest hold the boost thruster down while they dodge side to side and unload their semi-automatic laser cannon to clear a path and achieve victory. Try your luck at one of the four different levels of difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Easy: Might be the best place to start practicing with the controls, get familiar with the maneuverability of your spaceship and its features.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Medium: Standard level of difficulty that gets you flying fast as you get closer to the exit portal. It is recommended to start this level without using the boost thruster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Hard: Your reaction time will need to be impressive to make it out of this level alive. Asteroids will be flying by and your spaceship has no brakes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Extreme: You must be in perfect synchronization with your spaceship and managing your ammunition to stand a chance of posting a time in this level.
