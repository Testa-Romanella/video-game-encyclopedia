Upgrade your colony during each level with species-specific tech options. Use the upgrades to adapt your colony as the levels get harder.</li><li>Access to 3 playable ant species\u00a0(+1 unlocked after beating the campaign).

In each level, raise a target number of young queens in order to select an upgrade from one tech tree, and then also locate a piece of ant trivia somewhere on the map to randomly receive an upgrade from another tech tree. This combination of chosen and randomized upgrades makes each play-through unique and more challenging to optimize. Each playable ant species has 11+ unique upgrades that make each species play differently.</p>\n<p><strong>Marauder Ants</strong></p>\n\n<p>Marauder Ants are close relatives to Army Ants, but maintain permanent colonies and can even have multiple queens. These are the easiest species to play as their upgrades focus on growing a large colony of fearsome fighters.</p>\n<p><strong>Leafcutter Ants</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Leafcutter Ants have the most sophisticated insect societies in the world. Focus on growing your colony as large as possible, but don't forget you still have to take down the bad bugs to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Desert Ants</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The flexible Desert Ants prefer small, efficient colonies over mega-societies. When playing this species, you can upgrade your queen into a lone assassin.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<strong>How do the ants decide what to do?</strong>\n\n<p>Each worker ant acts totally independently, but with the use of pheromones of different kinds they can influence each other to coordinate their behavior. As you unlock additional pheromones then you can use the queen to lead your ants. Ants react to each pheromone type differently based on their task. For example, ants that are carrying food will move towards higher concentrations of the Colony pheromone, while ants that are retrieving food outside the colony will move away from Colony pheromone and towards Food pheromone.</p>\n\n<strong>Background</strong>\n\n<p>I've been obsessed with ants since childhood and this game is the result of much research on ant behavior. I was particularly influenced by the work of E.O. Wilson,\u00a0Deborah Gordon, and Mark Moffett.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<strong>What's coming next</strong>\n\n<p>Depending on how popular this game is, I have many additional features I'd like to add. Here are some in order of priority:</p>\n<ul><li>Additional playable species (think Argentinean Ants, Fire Ants, Army Ants...)</li><li>Additional enemy bug types</li><li>Coop/competitive multiplayer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T07:28:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430ed7e5fa457f8a576e5007923119ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ben Eskildsen"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
