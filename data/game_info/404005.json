You can choose the launch speed and launch angle, the rest is up to the gravitational pull of the planets. Collect as much data as you can, and don't crash into a planet, or drift outside of their gravitational pull, otherwise it's game over. Remember, the slower you approach a planet the more time you have to gather data, but don't go too slow, or you'll get sucked in! Good luck. (Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out).<br/></p>\n<p>The further away from earth the planet is, the larger the volume of collected data.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>MUSIC: Richard Strauss, Also sprach Zarathustra.</p>\n<p>https://archive.org/details/uso20000527</p>\n<p>Usage\u00a0Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States</p>\n<p>Licence:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/legalcode<br/></p>\n<p>SOUND from freesound.org:</p>\n<p>Explosion by Iwiploppenisse</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Iwiploppenisse/sounds/156031/</p>\n<p>Licence:\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/legalcode</p>\n<p>Unity asset store free assets:</p>\n<p>Planet Earth Free by headwards</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/planet-earth-free-23399<br/></p>\n<p>Magellan (satellite) by Evgeny Pritula</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/magellan-98970</p>\n<p>Skyboxes from default Unity 2019.30f1 skybox package<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d1db609fd91bfdd6276ef299b14cfa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dutchlish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
