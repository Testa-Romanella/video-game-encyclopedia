I made it in Stencyl, and for some reason using Flash.</p>\n<p>After finishing this game and uploading it to Kongregate,\u00a0my harddrive corrupted and I lost all the data.\u00a0The only thing I have left of this game is the SWF file, so why not upload it here as well? This is why you need\u00a0<strong>backups. ALWAYS.</strong></p>\n<p>Disabled donations because a) it is\u00a0a bad game; b) literally can't enable them</p>\n<p><strong><em>WARNING</em></strong>: For some reason, after 30 seconds of you existing,\u00a0the game starts to lag horribly. Just die to stop that.\u00a0It seems at though the massive lag happens only on my computer. More reasons to put it online!</p><p>In any case, if you're reading this - thank you! I hope you enjoyed Uphill.
