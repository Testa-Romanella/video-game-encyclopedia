A close, intimate third-person camera, savage attacks, finishing moves and a small magic ability system. This is my Final Major Project at University and is currently\u00a0around 8 weeks into production.<br/></p>\n<p>It is essentially a game prototype and my first attempt at making a substantial 3D game in my favourite genre. I recommend playing with a <strong>controller/gamepad</strong> and as I am only halfway through production <strong>there will be further balancing, voice recordings and an art pass later on</strong> with environmental storytelling and some extra visual language etc. but <strong>any feedback is appreciated!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I would appreciate feedback and bug reporting as I enter the testing phase of my project. Either way, I hope you enjoy playing it :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>LINK TO BUG REPORT</strong>: https://forms.gle/paFSro14bUA5rueB6<br/></p>\n<p><strong>LINK TO FEEDBACK/RECOMMENDATION FORM:</strong> https://forms.gle/GVKfYp2C6tv5SsMU7</p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKSTORY</strong>:</p>\n<p>You are Freya, the Vanir Goddess and Wife of the All-father Odin.
