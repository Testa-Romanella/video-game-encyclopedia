Your job is to make sure the mRNA bases are matched with the correct DNA bases. Perfection is expected, one single mistake could completely disrupt the entire operation. No pressure.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mrs. Bolmer's Biology Honors class for a project on protein synthesis.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Drag the mRNA bases to the corresponding DNA bases.</p>\n<p>A &lt;- U</p>\n<p>T &lt;- A</p>\n<p>G &lt;- C</p>\n<p>C &lt;- G</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Bases are specific to their match, including duplicates. If a match doesn't work, try it with the other match.</p>\n<p>Best if played in fullscreen mode.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks</strong> to Mrs. Bolmer for her continuous\u00a0support and patience with this project.
