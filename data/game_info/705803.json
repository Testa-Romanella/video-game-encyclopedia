How similar the colour of the pellet is to the creature determines how efficiently it is eaten.</p>\n<p>The creatures' AI is a single perceptron. The weight and bias of all inputs to this perceptron, and the physical characteristics of the creature is slightly mutated randomly every generation. <br/></p>\n<p>You can inspect a creature's genetics at any time, us use tools to create fresh creatures, pellets, pellet spawners, and walls, and make effects over the overall simulation the speed of time, pellet limit, creature limit, etc.</p>\n<p>Note: Creatures do not start with a very high fitness, so you may need to start with very hospitable conditions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:10:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb5cdab95c7d46ed7abe955ed64b469e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["blazar1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
