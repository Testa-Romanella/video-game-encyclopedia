Either way, I'd appreciate some constructive criticism on the way I interpreted everything and the gameplay!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gameplay:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are living in a mystical world, where when one passes away, their body might cease to exist but their soul stays and continues to inhabit the world. Others may choose to take on your soul and also continue to live. You are now 16 and have just received a letter from your father's soul about your brother whom you once believed to have died (his soul and body). Unravel the secret meaning of this twisted letter and your brother's whereabouts through this interactive fiction game.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Interpretation Of Theme/Limitation:</em></strong></p>\n<p>The information about her brother was being passed down to Fay using the cascade effect. The way I used the limitation was by giving the player a 'finite amount' of responses instead of the player being able to type an infinite amount of responses.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Music Information:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0did create a soundtrack for this game with the help of an AI (Soundraw) and then I added a few last touches in Soundtrap. Sadly, Twine was unable to display the soundtrack in my game but if you wanted to give it a listen, I've uploaded it on the itch.io page!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T04:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012ffd35e0c9f976adc1a6a085df0b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chickenWing2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
