When the game is run it allows the user to draw using different shaped objects and color variations, with added features glow and opacity. These objects are automatically destroyed after 3 seconds, or at\u00a0time specified by the user using a slider. The destroy setting can also be toggled off, or the user can destroy themselves by right-clicking on spawned objects. A clock displays the user's console time and can be toggled between AM/PM, with the game environment simulating a scene for that time of day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T07:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/06036e7e77f17a19ff70bc7dffcf3a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kayligbrower"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
