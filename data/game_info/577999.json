This is a proof of concept, with a few enemies and stuff to buy, just to make sure that the primary gameplay loop works. I would love some feedback and criticism, particularly regarding the artwork and music. Be brutally honest; I'm too close to this project at this point to be able to check myself. All the music is original music made by me in GarageBand. All the art is original, made by my own good self in MS Paint (yes for real don't laugh at me), and the game itself is also all my original work (from the code\u00a0down to the in-game font), made in Game Maker Studio 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>INFO:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press the \"Page Up\" button on your keyboard the moment the game starts, and read the readme thing in the zip file for controls and further information. You can't enter grey doors, the red door leads to the tavern, the blue door leads to the shop. If you want more information regarding what I\u00a0plan to do for this project and why, all that stuff is detailed in my YouTube videos, you can find the link on my profile. I know it's not even in it's infancy, but I'm really excited about this project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad6acd60698430509b1a501bdb5edf56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Jules"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
