The game is a puzzle-platformer that you have to break free from a office/company/factory/administrative building full of guards and other boxes. You can mess around with lots of devices that are in there to aid your escape.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by <strong>savi </strong>and <strong>guimm</strong>\u00a0for the \"My First Game Jam: Summer Edition\" Jam.</p>\n<p>contact: leo.savis@gmail.com</p>\n<p>\"I am glad that I participated in this Jam. Even though the game still have some issues, like the need of a better closure or the fact that the music resets all the time, I really liked the result, and definitely learned a lot about Unity while making it (even though savi made the majority of the programing). Maybe I will continue working on the game in the future, who knows?
