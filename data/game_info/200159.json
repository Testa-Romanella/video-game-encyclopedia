Each game was cobbled together, one person at a time, with nobody knowing what they would be working on until they got it. It was an experiment in collaboration and building on the work of others. It was also an exercise in creativity, letting go of intention and surrendering to the communal flow. It was a lot of fun!</p>\n<p>Six people worked on this track. The few draggable shapes it started with became the pieces of a unique physics-based arcade mechanic.<br/></p>\n<p>Final game is above. You can also see the game as it was after each day with links below:</p>\n<p>Day 1 - Tegan Bunsu<br/>Day 2 - Sutton Ashby<br/>Day 3 - David Machov<br/>Day 4 -  Andrew Han<br/>Day 5 -  Joe Giglio<br/>Day 6 - Joe Mirizio (Final, above)<br/></p>\n<p>There were also Exquisite Corpse tracks in Unity, Twine, Analog and PuzzleScript.\u00a0 Check them out!\r\n</p>\n<p>The jam was inspired by the Exquisite Corpse parlor game, invented by the surrealists.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82485b5213536f5123d4a9c80dbe900.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhillyGameMechanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
