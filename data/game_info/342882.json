It was an abject failure. The employees disassociated themselves from it. The prototype was quickly buried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shark Grin closed down soon after. They have been all but lost to history.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is the prototype.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>...</p>\n<p>(This is parody! It's not actually a lost PS1 game.)</p>\n<p>For 1-4 players.
