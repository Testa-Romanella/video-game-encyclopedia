You will be aiming for the dominoes that contain a marble on top of them in order to continue onto the next Plinko board.\u00a0 Once a marble is rolled all of the way down on the 2nd Plinko board, the Blue Doorway behind will open. Then from there you can play on the 2nd level. This is currently a prototype of a game idea we at the \"Winging It Studios\" have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Developers: Carlos Torres &amp; William Marchant from \"Winging It Studios\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b9128afb0d7cfcf2af59ed28064488e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["QwertytheBirdie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
