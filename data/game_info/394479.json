The goal is to get the ball in the opponents goal while navigating through a sea of constantly falling pills. As a game, it's improved over its predecessor, but if you thought it was hard in a 2D environment, try it in 3D!</p>\n<p>Note: There seems to be some problems if too many keyboard inputs are pressed at once, so beware.</p>\n<p>Music is not done by me. Full list of credits can be found in the Read Me found in the .rar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:12:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/065f1b028a7dccf87b07d069364e8eaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Funky Productions"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
