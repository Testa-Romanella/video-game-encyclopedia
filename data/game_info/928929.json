This is only to test to see if I can make an adventure game and shouldn't be looked as a complete game. In this game you play as an alien who is searching across the galaxy for the nicest beverage in the multiverse. He finds himself in a small town on the planet earth and must communicate with the locals to find the beverage he is looking for. Also for some reason the WEBGL file made my movement more wonky and also make sure your on full screen or else the sprite proportions will be off!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a544143e190afc10d9eea4a3f1d1f1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Archer Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
