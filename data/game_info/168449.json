Comments are also made by a disturbed fan in which they will go out of their way to inform someone or, enter comments that are about the original Artist and their work and should not be tampered with.</li></ul></li><li>Disturbed fans that push back and make negative comments of Remixed work are more apt to do so when a song is performed by a different artist versus the sampling of the original artist and remixed with completely with different sounds or, in a different style<ul><li>Cover Band Artists were far more successful, with these types of users, when generating a new fan base.</li><li>It was found that these users were sometimes tolerant of Mashups using original artist's samples across their same style of music</li><li>This did seem somewhat generational with users of age 40 plus</li><li>As for most other generations, they have experienced the remix mashup and sampling of musical styles throughout most of their years.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></ul> <p>During this study:</p><p>Almost all generations of musical fans were attracted physically to people that preformed the music and would rather experience the Artist's live through videos or, concerts if the content was of good quality and as the song was remembered. Thus illustrating the key element of this project was to broadcast the event to better Fan experience &amp; offer Artists the ability to visually express their ideas and inspiration behind the music creation for their fans.</p> Inspiration for researching the future Fan experience <ul><li>One of our inspirations to build a better experience for the fan's experience was from:</li></ul> <ul><ul><li>Muse Application was created by BT &amp; Dr. Richard Boulanger searching for New Sound <ul><li>a Virtual gesture based application &amp; using MIT's CSound, <ul><li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTWn2vLTMIk</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Fan not only seeing &amp; hearing the artist, <ul><li>Being engaged in how the music is created &amp; delivered is commonly missing from even today's live DJ shows.</li></ul></li><li>Artists are often hidden behind a wall or, the instrument &amp; method of creation is not fully visible like a concert with a Guitarist, Drummer or, even a Pianist.<ul><li>Which is why, turntable scratching is still so compelling to DJ Fans. <ul><li>2 records and 2 turntables offering a sound that should be annoying <ul><li>Provide a harmonic and curious sound</li><li>Almost everyone has attempted to create a sound at one point. </li><li>Could not reproduce with a standard turntable &amp; LP. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>With You Tube's popularity <ul><li>You can now illustrate for your fans with the right equipment and skills to apply a quality scratch placement during the record cutting of tracks.<ul><li>Get feedback from fans &amp; deliver content to your audience that allows for a user's engagement through comments.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Example; The BT Muse Application - Unless fans understand why they are waving their hands in the air and will wonder what they are doing. <ul><li>The non-standard DJ form could heighten the experience when Fans can visually see what BT movements are doing to generate the sound. Live.<ul><li>Thus unlocking engagement and the curiosity that lies within each and every one of us. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></ul> <p>Curiosity about Muse @ how it might have been built? </p><p>For sure the CSound was used, below is a Leap Motion controller module I found from a Berkley upload\u2026Was thinking it maybe just be part of the Muse Source core or inspired it! </p> <ul><li>CSound documents \u2013 Developed @ MIT<ul><li>Microsoft OneDrive View - http://1drv.ms/1Ok5iBF</li></ul></li><li>CSound_606_LeapInto01_ZIP_Installers \u2013 Developed @ Berkley <ul><li>Microsoft OneDrive View - http://1drv.ms/1Ok5bGm</li></ul></li></ul>  AR\\VR Application R&amp;D Usage &amp; functionality <ul><li>This, section has been written to assist with the understanding of why we are offering advice and guidance for users looking to have the option to choose which application should be explored versus, the understanding of how and why AR &amp;VR are parallel capable devices: <ul><li>In so many areas AR &amp; VR offer capabilities that are lacking from one or, the other's program design. </li><li>VR \u2013 Offers users an alternative reality <ul><li>Virtual reality needs to offer more than a single option such as hearing and not only the sensory of visual sensation</li></ul></li><li>AR \u2013 Brings computing &amp; entertainment in physical reality <ul><li>Offering a shared physical reality &amp; virtual computing space. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The application for our 3D Jam (DJ\\VR Future Fan Experience) project suggests that;<ul><li> It has to be up to be which reality each user wants to fulfill or experience. </li></ul></li><li>During this project, we discovered VR &amp; AR technologies were calling out for futurist programmers to offer new capabilities, technologies and ideals that progressively moved programming and computing technologies to move forward. Warning. that we should turn away from recoding habits &amp; idealisms that hinder the progression of technology for nothing more than self-profit and personal gain.<ul><li>We compared applications versus deploying only the application we felt was best for the project and our futurist and forth coming fans. </li></ul></li><li>We wanted to obtain a collection of audio, visual and broadcasting tools that offer futurist programmer's the following options:<ul><ul><li>Usage capabilities</li><li>Capabilities that worked </li><li>Capabilities that offer and had the ability to offer idealistic forward thinking functionality </li></ul><li>Apps leveraged were:<ul><li>Free </li><li>Open sourced</li><li>Purchasing based on both low &amp; higher costs</li><li>Computing space that is both minimal &amp; HPC (High Performance Computing) that comes with very costly overhead</li></ul></li><li>Hoping to locate applications:<ul><li>That could assist in minimizing computing footprints <ul><li>That had the best chance for zero exceptions &amp; error handling designs for future quantum computing tests. </li><li>Offering Users and Developers a virtual experience focused on enhancements and new feature design requests versus wasting, time and energy on bug\\fix-action requests</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p>AR \u2013vs- VR: The age of shared realities, thoughts on (Physical Reality &amp; Virtual Computing)</p> <ul><li>Which is better? <ul><li>This is an answer that I could not produce a conclusive AR\\VR answer for, as they both have elements that appeal to different Virtual computing needs. <ul><li>Each user is different while some will desire virtual elements in shared physical space like the AR offer. Others might more enjoy the ability to be visually entertained through VR style elements which enable them to enjoy a virtual 3D design of the artist's creative idealisms that inspire their creation of music works. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Is VR even a desired technology for future development? Since modem computing developments have illustrated the capabilities to enhance augmented reality capabilities through projection illustration &amp; mapping methods?<ul><li>It is suggested that VR can achieve the capabilities to virtualize more than just our visual senses other than a VR environment that is appealing for a number of applications: <ul><li>We imagine back to the days when we were young kids at the Freedom Fest of 1990 in Dallas, Texas in which one of our favorite musician's Stevie Ray Vaughan performed live with his brother Jimmie Vaughan . I was amazed after experiencing that performance. Then to hear that he was killed in a helicopter crash going to Chicago. What a sad day to know that Freedom Fest would be the last time anyone would ever experience a Stevie Ray Vaughan concert again. </li><li>Stevie Ray was one of my favorite blues artist's growing up. <ul><li>The ability to experience a live concert he was headlining would be such a cool experience.<ul><li>Amongst so many other artists from beyond my generation, I have only experienced within Audio such as; YouTube and other music video sites. </li></ul></li><li>With VR technologies, it is definitely possible with the 3D rendering capabilities to generate the visual experience of these live concert events again! </li><li>However, VR would provide a much more realistic experience when we finally achieve core sensory virtualization. Allowing for human perception virtualization. We believe that this would require at least 4 of the 5 senses to truly feel the VR emotional experience. These four senses are the most effective:<ul><li>Sight</li><li>Sound</li><li>Smell</li><li>Touch</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>VR application thoughts on what it could offer us:<ul><li>VR could possibly be leveraged for Cryo-Stasis within a long term space flight, I developed a Music composition in the early 2000's called Cryo-Stasis with thoughts in mind such as; Demolition Man, The Matrix and Vanilla Sky.A time when Cryo-Stasis environments were leveraged successfully. <ul><li>Each of the movies illustrated the user within the environment who must believe in the reality of an environment they were in before the acceptance of the reality.Or, that the individual needed to have capabilities of the active thought process during a Cryo-Stasis state.<ul><li>My CD was developed with this concept in mind. <ul><li>That Cryo-Stasis will only work if, the mind is active. The thought process was that the mind could generate enough electrical energies through stimulation and awaken from a Cyro-Stasis state allowing, for successful regeneration. </li></ul></li><li>My musical projects were designed in an abstract form of music that had an energy that did not increase beyond the point that would cause an awakening or, go so slow that it would not be affective. <ul><li>Also, taking into account that if a song sparked memories of an event in their life, this could cause issues both, negative or, possibly offer a positive result that even within a Cryo-Statis state, the mind and memories would still be active</li></ul></li><li>So, the elements I leveraged used audio virtualization with repetitive euphoric electrical and classical sounds. <ul><li>With the belief that this would produce minimal impacting memories from musical styles the Cryo-Statis user had adopted. </li><li>Allow for the mind to stay active during the Cryo-Stasis generated time line. </li><li>A possibility of success seems viable to me since sound has been known to elevate objects so therefore, why not keep the mind dreaming?<ul><li>The thought process and belief system of \"I think therefore, for I am.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Developing VR systems that stimulate other neuro senses could only assist in the delivery that is believable and enjoyable therefore, becoming a useful experience. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>I also think that people will desire leverage VR capabilities for an escape from their everyday realities. I am sure we all have had this thought process at some point or another in our own lives. <ul><li>This quote is used by a number of emotionally distressed people often leading to\\or, are already having; <ul><li>Psychological issues</li><li>Addictions</li><li>Suicidal thoughts </li><li>Or, just thoughts within a depressive state</li><li>It's a wonder if, these states can and are the leading causes ofdivorce, broken homes or, dysfunctional ways of living </li></ul></li><li>If that is the case then, a virtualized break through could be the cure for aliments or, some of those situations. Some people can overcome issues without experiencing alternative realities</li></ul></li><li>Another thought for VR that I myself and almost anyone I have encountered say that they would give anything to spend time with a lost family member or a loved one again.<ul><li>To have the ability to have any kind of time at one point or, another that felt like a realistic experience with a lost family member or, a loved one could be uplifting and would be something anyone could say they would enjoy again.</li></ul></li><li>VR for medical usage such as, paralyzed individuals could mentally gain the abilities they once lost in a physical world. <ul><li>The Avatar movie sense of methodology</li></ul></li><li>Using VR to experience historical and educational events<ul><li>Travel to Eras that are appealing and of interest which AR could not offer.<ul><li>The movie, The 13th Floor comes to mind</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <ul><li>AR applications for my fan based Leap Motion 3D music project:</li></ul> <ul><li>In my experience, the ability to use physical instruments is a must have so, AR would be a desired element for my performances.<ul><li>Currently, there are no MIDI\\OSC controllers that offer the ability to;<ul><li>Scratch vinyl records</li><li>Set the step sequencer note settings on my legacy drum modules</li><li>The inability to interact with physical and virtual object causes a less desirable experience for my current performance would be the uses of VR integrated hardware head gear</li><li>Leap Motion hand gestures for effects controls is a very nice addition that I can see progressing greatly in the future with additional applications and the integrations of more MIDI instruments controlled applications and musical instrument companies with their vendors adapting to the support of a VR musical development platform</li></ul></li><li>AR development could allow for extended functionality controls to my physical hardware as well as the ability to manage the software based application in a more dynamic manner.<ul><li>Through configuring personalized controlled environments around my workstation to ensure quick response times and application management flows with in my DJ set</li><li>When looking at the capabilities of AR within a live set &amp; projection mapping support of the computer based applications</li><li>This offering with the hand gesture capabilities in Leap Motion I could even leverage online applications like http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/<ul><li>Which is a compact version of my physical DJ production audio creation &amp; live workstation setup.<ul><li>Just Web based &amp; functionality not intended for Live performance usages </li></ul></li><li>Offering capabilities to bring applications like Tone Matrix into my physical space enhances my ability to deliver a better performance for the audience.<ul><li>While allowing me an extra workstation suit that can be preconfigured with needed settings to create a seamless flow from instrument to instrument.<ul><li>Offering me more time to focus on effects </li><li>A Capella's</li><li>Cueing samples</li><li>Vocal changes </li><li>Energy buildups</li><li>Heightening the fan experience </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Future supportability for application based turntables could deliver capabilities for longevity of vinyl records since scratch\\cutting records are easily damaged beyond playable capabilities after 40 to 50 sessions that integrate scratch style approaches.<ul><li>This would also be cool since individual audience members can enjoy visually seeing the standard DJ's scratch styles. By being engaged in the music set with less worry of breaking equipment or, causing live performances with audio train wrecks.</li><li>Thus offering the capabilities to get the crowd involved similar to an illusionist's show. The audience's engagement in a live set is something I only get to do in the studio or, at home. Because of the concerns with audio mix integrity and issues of breaking hardware.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p>INTERFACES</p> Project Audio hardware selections  <p>There are plenty of Music based applications both on Leap Motion &amp; Unity's app store's web offerings.This is not the true excitement of the overall project task we were attempting to achieve nor, was it the real reason of interest in our project design. The Fan or, user experience seems to be of a greater interest &amp; was unexplored territory </p> <ul><li>We felt that using both parts of the artist and fan experience would bring exposer to a core problem with the Musical &amp; Fan experience.</li></ul> <p>We, found that the music application offering within these app stores, all fail to meet what is truly the exceptional fan experience. The VR Music applications that are available today offer a uniqueness which in turn make for amazing fun or, integration functionality\\capabilities. </p> <ul><li>However, each are limited to the constraints of current sensor technologies &amp; with in a VR world are limited by the inability to experience or leverage augment controls in real world instruments within real time. </li></ul>  Audio Mixing\\Mastering:  <ul><li>Documents about Audio applications tested &amp; downloads for application our Microsoft One Drive<ul><li>View - permissions</li><li>http://1drv.ms/1lc9Wp9</li></ul></li><li>Audacity<ul><li>Audacity might well be the best-known &amp; most widely used open source music application.
