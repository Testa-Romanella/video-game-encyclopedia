It is made as an school asignment and the time limit was 5 days. We had a theme to work from and based our game from a text that was given to us. The game is about a president named Ronald Dump. He is angry because he has been banned to use all social media by the office he works in. But he will not give up, he will fight his way to send out one last Kvitt in the social media network Kvitter.</p><p>Updates to the game may follow.</p>\n<p>Credit:<br/></p>\n<p>\"Corruption\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>Made by: Lukas Ax (lukasax) Alexander Brierly Chramer (thadameer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961143eb83a86a1948466901f7fafd94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lukasax"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
