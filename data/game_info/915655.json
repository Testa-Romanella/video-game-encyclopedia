This is my 6th bio-inspired simulation. Unfortunately compute shaders in WebGL are yet not supported by any computer graphics APIs, maybe in the furute I'll redo this in WebGPU.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For now only Windows version is available but if\u00a0 anyone wants a version for Linux or Mac I can add them too.\r\n</p>\n<p>Made as a part of an assignment from @Arsiliath course to write compute shaders in Unity. Check him and his course out\u00a0here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also huge thanks to\u00a0Jeff Jones &amp; @mxsage for writing the amazing article that made this possible.</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9d/c9dda9994d6a777a0a74e7fa308c8c53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gubebra"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
