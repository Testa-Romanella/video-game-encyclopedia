Explore Podcast Island and capture all of the 10 escaped podcasts.</p>\n<p>Or, if you don't like that story: The podcasts are living their best lives in their native habitat. That must end. Capture them. Make them your pets. Humans rule!</p>\n<p>Or, if you don't like that story either: because the player character is outfitted in radioactive protective gear, maybe the podcasts are radioactive, and they need to be captured and properly discarded.</p>\n<p>This game is my first Unreal Engine project. It's got plenty of issues, for sure. My main focus was to learn Unreal Engine, with things like gameplay, level design, optimization, performance, and everything else being way, way down the list of priorities. With this in mind, the project was a huge success. I\u00a0really like Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p>All assets are sourced either from Unreal Engine Quixel Bridge, made myself, or come from the following sources.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Unreal Marketplace sources</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>City of Brass props: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/90cfc029052b431898380e1f0f872bd0\r\n</li><li>Trees: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/tropical-vegetation-pandanus-plants?sessionInvalidated=true\r\n</li><li>Low Poly Medieval Interior and Constructions: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/low-poly-medieval-interior-and-constructions\r\n</li><li>Niagara Footstep VFX https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/niagara-footstep-vfx\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous sources</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Boat: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-painted-wooden-boat-v3-1850170\r\n</li><li>Microphone: https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/725806\r\n</li><li>Radiation Character: Mixamo\r\n</li><li>Ocean Sound: https://freesound.org/people/klangfabrik/sounds/428088/\r\n</li><li>Stone pillar lowering: https://freesound.org/people/Thalamus_Lab/sounds/232102/\r\n</li><li>Stone button pressing: https://freesound.org/people/patchytherat/sounds/530988/\r\n</li><li>Door creek sound: https://freesound.org/people/JarredGibb/sounds/219499/\r\n</li><li>Footsteps sounds: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/footsteps-31 and https://www.storyblocks.com/audio/stock/footsteps-shoes-walk-fast-beach-sand-rgixzgp2udhk0wxwjg0.html and https://freesound.org/people/seenms/sounds/518666/\r\n</li><li>Button icons: https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack\r\n</li><li>Boat oar: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/free-boat-paddles-3d-model/1102510\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Background music</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Fantasy Ambience by Alexander Nakarada<br/>Link: https://filmmusic.io/song/4953-fantasy-ambience<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T07:07:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d9/9d938e22635efe91c2cbf7465f1b3957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["calebjross"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
