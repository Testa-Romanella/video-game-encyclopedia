Almost everything wants to kill you so be careful. The way you protect yourself from enemies is either to run from them or to <strong>push them out</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>What's the mission</strong></p>\n<p>The space has\u00a06 different zones with special missions. Your task is to complete these missions as soon as you can and with the least number of deaths.</p>\n<p>If you play solo, only your deaths are counted (your allies are controlled by AI) but it takes more time to collect the resources. However, if you play with your friends then all of your deaths are counted but you can finish the game faster.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD </strong>to move</li><li><strong>Space </strong>- hit the brakes</li><li><strong>Left Mouse\u00a0Button </strong>- shoot</li><li><strong>Right Mouse\u00a0Button </strong>- special ability (blue player - teleport, green player - super shoot, pink player - shield)</li><li><strong>Shift </strong>- accelerate</li><li><strong>E</strong> - zoom<br/>\n</li><li><strong>ESC </strong>- return to main menu<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Servers</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game has 3 servers available: America (US, California), Europe (Germany) and Asia\u00a0(Singapore), choose the one that's the closest to you and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Game philosophy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As people who love playing co-op games (like<em>\u00a0Deep Rock Galactic, Helldivers, Trine,</em>\u00a0etc) and people who enjoy learning new things and creating\u00a0we decided to learn how to\u00a0make our own online co-op game from scratch. The idea was to create a 15-20 minutes game session (so it doesn't take too long) for friends to have fun, and each session should give a new experience due to randomness and world generation. We've been working on this project since the middle of 2021, refactoring the logic, graphics, music and now\u00a0we think we are ready to share it with you. We hope you enjoy it :)</p>\n<p><strong>Original SoundTrack</strong></p>\r\nWSOCHA \u00b7 Push Them Out (Original Soundtrack)\r\n\r\nWSOCHA \u00b7 Push Them Out (SFX)\r\n\n<p><strong>Developers, links and\u00a0used tools</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programmer<ul><li>https://itch.io/profile/silver3310\u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>Python (pygame + pymunk) for\u00a0the server</li></ul><ul><li>Unity for the client</li></ul></li><li>Graphics designer<ul><li>https://itch.io/profile/mefeliks2140</li><li>Illustrator,\u00a0Unity</li></ul></li><li>Sound designer<ul><li>https://itch.io/profile/wsocha</li><li>SoundCloud:\u00a0\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/gowsochago\u00a0</li><li>Ableton, Wwise</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T06:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb2ae970a9511aed8e07edf2590447a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver3310", "Mefeliks2140", "Wsocha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
