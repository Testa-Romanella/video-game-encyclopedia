The concept althought is simple, the way you do it is painstakingly slow.</p>\n<p>//Controls//<br/>Hold Z to move<br/>Hold Shift (left shift) to hide in shell (birds can't get you when you're hiding)</p>\n<p>//Gameplay//<br/>The game is played in 6 minute long in-game days and each part of the day depends whether you can move or if you die</p>\n<p>//times where you can move<br/>Dawn,the last 30 minutes of the Afternoon,night,and when it rains. rocks make you move slower(because rocks don't rock)</p>\n<p>//times you can't move<br/>daytime,the first 30 minutes of the afternoon, if you find salt, do not touch!! birds will fly and try to carry you away as food.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, to keep you from getting bored, random events may happen. But i can tell you you more. You need to experience the journey for yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f20b26221ae765ded44862b28e320604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
