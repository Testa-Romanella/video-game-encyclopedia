Programming done by Cory Smith, Nick Magnus, and Gabe Troyan; Art by Jocelyn Bedell and Vahan Ionnisian.</p>\n<p><em>SSS</em> is\u00a0a one-on-one platform-fighter wherein you and a friend control two brothers hell-bent on beating the piss out of each other with various toys and objects. For extra, familial effect, playing the game involves sharing a keyboard. (Controller support may come at a later date.) In the menus, you can customize colors and\u2014like any good fighting game\u2014adjust your turbo setting. As each sibling gets beat up, they build up rage. At 100%, they throw a tantrum and lose the round. The rounds go on indefinitely, so play to your heart\u2019s content!</p>\n<p>Controls are as follows:</p>\n<strong>Control</strong><strong>Player 1</strong><strong>Player 2</strong>MovementA/D\u2190/\u2192JumpW\u2191FastfallS\u2193Pick up/ChuckB0/InsPick up/LobN./DelParryMEnter", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b63a60c4ff937bb8368c62c98ab3b8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GabeEddyT"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
