Each enemy type requires different approach to be dealt with. Most enemies can be killed with different types of weapons, but only one is most efficient against each given monster. Some types of monsters are even immune to particular damage and using weapon with that damage would be a waste of precious ammunition.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t As you progress and upgrade the equipment, weapon and ammunition for that weapon will become more and more powerful against enemies with resistances, and therefore more weapon choices to deal with them will become available.\r\n</p>\r\nUPGRADES\r\n<p>\r\n\tEvery weapon, its ammunition and astronaut equipment will have up to 6 upgrades, 3 upgrades minimum. This brings amount of upgrades for only weapons and ammo to more than 50. Carrying capacity of ammunition can also be upgraded and will have 12 levels each. Astronaut has 18 equipment upgrades - fuel tank, jets, and augmentations. These upgrades will reduce fuel consumption, movement efficiency and resistance against certain enemies and environments, and unlock ability to carry heavy weaponry, such as minigun, hand cannon and upgraded machine gun.\r\n</p>\r\nPUZZLES\r\n<p>\r\n\tMost of the levels will have different puzzles to solve in order to progress through the game or find goodies. Player will have drones which help explore the surrounding, to collect item required to solve puzzle from inaccessible to player areas, access switches behind obstacles, lure key monster etc.\r\n</p>\r\nENVIRONMENT\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to monsters in the game, another threat is a moon unstable environment.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAcid swamps, moving toxic clouds, deep craters with deadly inhabitants which nobody had survived to tell about, plants that burn under ones feet, all these will introduce additional challenge to a player. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/1302b131ae978ed818f3c35c8c8a5523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dbetelgeuse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
