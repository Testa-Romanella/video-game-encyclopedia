You were assigned to sort fruit and vegetables - concretely squashes, apples, lemons and grapes. Pretty normal, right? Well, it is. Atleast at the first glance. But there is a twist with capital T.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>You can enter into an agreement with Chaos. This will increase your score and give you some further bonuses, but it will also make a glitch in our reality, so the Cursed Arrows will be able to fly thru and hurt you. Do you agree?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Left and Right Arrow</strong>: Movement</p>\n<p><strong> Mouse</strong>: Open and Buy from Shop<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T18:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/993cbc0f1ab9d98172f9d21908913043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lasermtv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
