There is also an auxiliary punch with a less cooldown. You can also use jump pads (yellow spots on the field) to make a high jump. This is the basic mechanics on which the game is based. The game is quite dynamic, so move, create a series of brilliant passes and score!<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0to move\r\n</li><li><strong>Spacebar</strong> to jump</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0to look around\r\n</li><li><strong>Right Mouse Click\u00a0</strong>to shoot a pistol (you\u00a0must be close to the ball<em>)</em><br/>\n</li><li><strong>Left Mouse Click\u00a0</strong>to punch the ball (you must be close to the ball)\r\n</li><li><strong>Shift</strong>\u00a0to sprint (watch out for your stamina)</li><li><strong>Left Ctrl</strong>\u00a0to fall to the ground instantly (after jumping on the jump pad)</li><li><strong>Esc</strong>\u00a0to pause</li></ul>\r\nExtra information for customers and my supporters!\r\n<p>For the convenience of calculating the FPS performance and the ping, there are counters. On the left top corner is the fps (highest, average and lowest, respectively). On the right top corner is ping. If the ping is very high and it is impossible to play on the EU/US server, please contact me! Currently, there is only the possibility of playing in the EU/US region.</p>\n<p>This is just a prototype, I will welcome any criticism. Since there are still a lot of unfinished things, I will keep moving towards the \"dream\" game for some time. But without support, the project will probably stall, because any multiplayer project needs it.\u00a0Share the game with your friends or anyone else.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, at first the game supports only 20 people in the game at the same time. Exceeding the limit creates a queue. Therefore, the first funds from the donations will be used to purchase the Premium version of Photon and expand the possibilities so that more people can enjoy the game at the same time.<br/></p>\n<p>Be sure to write feedback and comments.\u00a0What you liked, didn't like, any ideas. Maybe the game reminded you of some other game? :)</p>\n<p>I will leave my contacts soon, for now we will have a connection in the comments or using emails.</p>\r\nInformation for developers and those interested:\r\n<p>Made by one person\u00a0without any experience in the game industry using the Unity engine and the Photon PUN multiplayer engine (its old version). In the future, of course, it is planned to switch to Fusion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bb/3bb240a57d3174d01e0571708b2a72b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorNB"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
