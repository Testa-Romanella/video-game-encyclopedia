That energy field are you. You will control the gravity to\r\nguide the astronaut to survive and end the game.</p>\n<p>You will control by\r\npressing one button the gravity\u00a0of the scene, with\r\nthat you will control your\u00a0character\r\n(Astronaut) to looking for oxygen\u00a0to survive and find\r\nthe other end.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>- Tutorials:\u00a0 Blackthornprod &amp; Brackeys.</p>\n<p>- Music: \"Busy Beat\" by Silent Partner.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype 3: REVENGE RACE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme \u2013 Revenge Racing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Problem Statement \u2013 Considering Flow, DDA and virtual sensation to create a single screen game that allows players to experience the concepts outlined in the lectures.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to drive in the desert avoiding holes, and other cars. Inputs R &amp;<br/>L keys. The idea is that as much meters you drive more cities you discover.<br/>Giving the idea of flow, keep driving to see what happened after and where do<br/>you end.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>- Tutorial:\u00a0<em>Dise\u00f1o</em><em> y </em><em>Programaci\u00f3n</em><em> de </em><em><em>videojuegos</em></em><em><em> </em>con Unity 5. </em><em>\u00a0</em><em>Marianito</em><em> Rivas | </em><em>Domestika</em>.</p>\n<p>- Music: Provide by Domestika tutorial.</p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>Prototype 4: AR FIGHTER</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Theme \u2013 Embodied Interaction and Tangible Media</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Problem Statement \u2013 Design and create a tangible interactive\u00a0experience to be shown in the final student showcase CRE8.
