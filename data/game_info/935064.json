People would disappear alongside the buildings they once called home, and officials\u00a0were clueless what to do...<br/><br/></em><em>...at least,\u00a0that is, until someone survived to tell the tale.\u00a0</em>\n<p><strong>Tremors</strong> is a Visual Novel that...I've worked on for a bit, and decided to post today. It's not a completely happy tale, and finished to gain closure on the work that I've done in the past.
