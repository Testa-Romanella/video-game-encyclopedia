Good news: at least you made it into Heaven!<br/><br/>When you first awaken in the afterlife, you find yourself on a tiny deserted island in the middle of the ocean.

For a place called Heaven, it sure doesn\u2019t feel much like paradise. There\u2019s no shelter to protect you from the elements, nor even any food to eat. In fact, the only thing here at all seems to be an old fishing rod lying down by the shore.
