Try and fail all of the puzzles, angering the manager of EvilPuzzles Corporation in doing so!</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>A, D, Left\u00a0Arrow, Right\u00a0Arrow - Moves the character left and right</li><li>Space Bar - Makes the character jump</li><li>Left Mouse Button - Clicks through dialogue and selects different options.</li></ul>\n<p>Credit</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ZachCreates has done all of the work you see except for the making of the assets you see below. These were not made for this game jam, they are separate assets made by other people entirely. You should still check\u00a0these assets out, though. They\u00a0are actually REALLY good!
