Though the Redguards of Hammerfell put up a valiant fight, they eventually crumbled to internal mutiny and the might of the Septim forces. Now under Imperial control, the Redguards are kept in line by the oppressive rule of Septim\u2019s retainer, Amiel Richton. It is within this setting that Cyrus, a Redguard mercenary that has travelled Tamriel for over a decade, begins his adventure. Investigating the disappearance of his sister, Iszara, Cyrus is brought back to Hammerfell and thrown into the political intrigue that besets Hammerfell and its inhabitants. In his search for his sister, he must also play his part in this war between the Crowns and the Forebears.<br />\nSet 400 years prior to the events of The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Redguard contrasts with the other games in many ways. As a third-person action-adventure game, it removes its RPG gloves and instead focuses on bringing you on an immersive journey through the eyes of Cyrus. If you\u2019ve wanted to try the Elder Scrolls series, but haven\u2019t quite enjoyed the RPG elements such as character building and customisation, this is definitely the game for you. But, despite taking a different path, this addition still contains many of the elements that the Elder Scrolls series is renowned for: a vast world, lore-laden narrative and compelling characters. So, whether you\u2019re a native or a newcomer to Tamriel, this swashbuckling adventure will keep you captivated to the very end.Thrilling adventure rich with lore, dialogue, backstory and atmosphere<br />\nExplore the Island of Stros M\u2019kai, from the darkest catacombs to the highest towers<br />\nNon-linear story progression, allowing you to explore the world at your own pace<br />\nPut your wits to the test by solving puzzles and uncovering the mystery of Iszara\u2019s disappearance</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-11T05:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ca3/ca33d086330031d9ad4e8e79a7943d7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.21, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 138, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 10, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 358, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
