But you can try to rack up as many points as possible on your way down.</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>- Avoid platforms as you fall, for each pass through the loop, gravity and maximum velocity increases.</p>\n<p>- Your barrier protects you from taking damage on platforms, but it recharges slowly.</p>\n<p>- Bounce on enemies to slow down your descent and get some breathing room.<br/></p>\n<p>- Collect gems and bop enemies to increase your score.<br/></p>\n<p>- Dotted platforms in the background gives a hint of what's coming up next.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Arrow keys (only left and right)</p>\n\r\nMade for #CGAJAM 2017\r\n<p>This game was made for the<strong> #CGAJAM 2017\u00a0</strong>with 3 of the 4 given themes in mind:<strong> History Repeats </strong>+\u00a0<strong>Always Faster + Gravity.</strong></p>\n<p>The idea for the themes was this: Each room/segment\u00a0(green or red area) shows what comes next if you look at the dotted platforms in the background. The room itself is then also repeated in a never-ending loop where gravity keeps increasing for each completed loop, causing you to fall faster and faster.<br/></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music:\u00a08bit Dungeon Boss Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/lic...</p>\n\r\nThanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00f/00f6209bba7e7cf715a9a97f3d1d2216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["itchabop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
