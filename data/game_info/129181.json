You cycle through the seasons and that will impact the game in different ways:<br/>spring - water frozen but the plants/trees grow;<br/>summer - water unfrozen and the plants/trees grow;<br/>autumn - water unfrozen but the plants are dead;<br/>winter - water frozen and the plants are dead;<br/><br/>The player will manipulate time in order to find Yggdrasil, the tree of life.<br/>But using your power also affects you. As the seasons pass, you get older (as expected, everytime you cycle through the 4 seasons, you get older 1 year). But be careful, if you abuse your power you can die!</p><p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>SPACE cycle through the seasons<br/>LEFT and RIGHT move<br/>UP jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f45b9825fbac9c6dd8f6ac405bdd4b5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IPCAGameJam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
