Limitation: Inanimate Player</p>\n<p>This game is 3D in terms of graphics, but the player can only be moved horizontally and vertically.</p>\n<p>You play as a leaf. The leaf itself cannot move and therefor needs to be moved differently. Due to unknown reasons, the leaf got stuck in another world/universe where it is located between heaven and hell. Pay attention to not fall into hell and find the portal in heaven that brings you back to the world you came from, the world of mortals. Since you cannot move, you gladly got the power to create heaven power explosions where you want. Use the knockback of the explosions to lead the leaf to the portal.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click at the position you want the explosion to be. (That's it!) But pay attention to your charge management, you can only launch 4 explosions in one fly, then you need to rest a few seconds on a cloud for recharging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ce/5ced9de4efa97d58b92f8510a1ab0de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Licke"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
