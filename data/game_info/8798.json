{"id": 8798, "slug": "trauma", "name": "TRAUMA", "name_original": "TRAUMA", "description": "<p>TRAUMA is a point-and-click adventure indie game developed by Krystian Majewski. The game was developed as a part of a thesis project and explores human experiences during being unconscious. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game tells a story of a woman, who survived a car accident, yet slipped into a coma. You go through several memories of hers and reveal her backstory.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game focuses on two mechanics in its gameplay: the usage of gesture-like mouse movements and a typical point-and-click experience. These mechanics are used by the player to move around the world of the game, which consists of several dreamscapes. Gestures are used in several specific moments and mimic the real world actions. These gestures can sometimes be used for traversing the world. </p>\n<p>Each dreamscape is represented using real photos, but with several artificial elements added to them. The primary objective of such dreamscapes differs and is told to the players after selecting one of the dreamscapes. During the game, a narrating voice can reveal plot details or hints. The players have to find nine Polaroid photos in each area. </p>\n<p>The players are to traverse all the dreamscapes and get every possible ending in the game. After revealing every ending for a specific dreamscape, the player is awarded a photo tracker, which makes finding the polaroids much easier.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "2011-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T22:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf17f3355be57f92313ec8ce3fc56f11.jpeg", "website": "http://www.traumagame.com", "rating": 2.3, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 40, "owned": 1015, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 57, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 57, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Krystian Majewski"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Headup Games", "Krystian Majewski"], "esrb_rating": null}
