I was experimenting with an arcade style game with RTS controls. It uses primitive line of sight and cover rules, and each of the levels is randomly generated.</p><p>Use the number keys to select different types of soldiers, for easy group control. The mouse does most of the work. All instructions are shown in the bottom left of the display.</p><p>Ultimately it doesn't have a solid loss situation so it can be a slow downhill spiral at times. However, with proper use of cover and effective positioning you can have some great moments! Good luck getting to the fortress!</p><p>Press NUMLOCK to toggle sticky selection. Do this once for your sake.</p><p>Use the number keys for selecting all of one soldier type, and spacebar for everyone. Eventually, more micro may be needed. Stay under cover!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd5/cd51badca635dad7a4e603364a53d826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sally Rough"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
