Sneak around and collect as much treasure as you can while trying not to get caught. With each treasure pick up, you get heavier and slower making it easier to get caught. Opening your inventory and dropping items can increase your speed again. Security cameras and patrolling guards are protecting these treasures. Keeping out of sight will keep you from being pursued. Don't take too long though. You only have two minutes to complete these heists, otherwise, the guards will know you broke in.  Remember, your ultimate goal is to not get caught!<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> A short and replayable game<br/></li><li> Steal jewels, gems, and gold in each of the 18 levels<br/></li><li> Test your skills by completing all 5 challenges in 1 round<br/></li><li> 2 types of locks requiring either a key or money level to unlock</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:14:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb0b1100bda3cffadde57e3204586c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BigRust75", "Alex Franco"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Desert Rat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
