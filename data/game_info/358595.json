I've actually already made a game similar to this (that's why this one has \"Jam Edition\" in the name) but the game was powered by Godot. Godot is an amazing engine, but I found it to be too heavy for such a light and simple game, so I took the idea and rewrote it with a lighter framework: Love2d. Unfortunately with the lack of time I've been having, I've barely been able to put much effort into the project, I was only able to get a run-able version up and going and wasn't able to polish it. Since the game is light and utilizes mouse, mobile should be supported, although I haven't tested it.<br/></p>\n<p>All you do in the game is to click to mouse to make the player jump, don't go below the screen and <strong>don't touch</strong> the white objects or it's game over! although that cute lookin' circle thing might be useful.....</p>\n<p>Feel free to post your best score in the comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f693bc814c0193d6ff25cd919552b0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DSGuy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
