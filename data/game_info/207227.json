{"id": 207227, "slug": "bienvenue-au-ballet", "name": "Bienvenue Au Ballet", "name_original": "Bienvenue Au Ballet", "description": "<p>This game is about experiencing my very first ballet class, as a high school freshman, in a class of all 4th graders. I chose this topic because it was an hour of my life where I was diving into a world completely alien to me, and I feel often that's what games do best. It's a memory that stands out to me as a big obstacle in life, and one I'm proud I overcame. However, I thought that the chaotic fumbling through the first class would be more uniquely entertaining than a representation of myself knowing how to dance. After learning about the physics joints in class, I knew I wanted to make a game that used physics in an interesting way. Upon thinking of this memory, I thought a hinge joint rag-doll would be the perfect way to articulate how out of place and inexperienced I felt in the class at first.</p>\n<p>I found most of the development process to be\u00a0fun, especially experimenting with the rag-doll to create wacky, impossible positions. This past week was a bit of a crunch, but I knew it was coming. Therefore, I reduced the scope in order to spend time polishing, so none of the game's components ended up being exceedingly stressful. I would say in general it was just difficult deducing a way to accomplish my tasks at first (modelling a human head in a reasonable amount of time, manipulating the ballerinas into their positions, etc.), but after working through a solution the first time I found repeating these tasks much easier.\u00a0 This is also why after struggling with programming last semester, I found that working in C# came much more naturally to me with this project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9841bacaf0994e7f9e8f0392a246f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kcp320"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
