A mysterious figure appears and tasks you with collecting duck-shaped rocks in order to defeat\u00a0<em>The Void,</em> a pure form of evil that is taking over the land. Throughout your quests, you will explore lively forests, scorching deserts, freezing tundras, and even your own dreams. Do you have what it takes to banish the void.. to the void?</p>\n<p>This game was my first attempt at a 3D game, which was finished in late 2015. I created everything but the sound effects and music, all of which are royalty-free and specified in the game's ending credits. This was my first dive into 3D modeling, large-scale game development, and storyboarding. While two \"sequels\" to this game exist, I am happy to receive feedback on this game despite the low likelihood of me updating this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bdc2c8767da42d8242ba034adf1f710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChiirYuu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
