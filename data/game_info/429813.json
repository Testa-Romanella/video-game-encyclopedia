Help Sam survive in this infected world and also save it by #flattening-the-curve.\u00a0\u00a0This game intends to spread awareness as well as point out that we must do what we can do to help in these dire times as we can't save ourselves without healing the city we live in.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also bear in mind the fact that Sam's city is infected by only 12 *Hyperactive* individuals\u00a0 every round showing a worst case scenario. Help Sam be an ideal person in this society.</strong></p>\n<p>Objectives:-\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>1. Locate the dynamically positioned green target square every round.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Obtain all spawned masks and donate them to the local hospital to help out the city.</strong></p>\n<p>P.s. If you come in close proximity with infected individuals you can wash your hands within 10s to reduce the risk of being infected. Also minimize interactions as not all infected individuals show symptoms aka\u00a0marked red. here.</p>\n<p>I thank and give all due credits for any resources and open source projects that may have been used in the development of this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Built By</p>\n<p>Noble Saji Mathews\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mentor: Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda</p>\n<p>IIT-Tp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:06:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac7ce2a53e2d389fd1ffd440b0229d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noble Saji Mathews"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
