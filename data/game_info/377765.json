Guide perry through the labyrinth of low budget drainage pipes to find plungers so he can clear the blockages and return to his friends and live poopily ever after.</p>\n<p>The Idea:</p>\n<p>\"PERRY POOP\" came from a simple toilet talk idea I had with my wife one day.</p>\n<p>The Idea was to create low budget time waster games over a course of a weekend. If the weekend was over and the game was not finished and playable the idea was scrapped.</p>\n<p>\"PERRY POOP\" was such a game and quite a success between family members. The concept of how something so simple can take up so much of your time. So we have have decided to release these games to the public as a dollar a game project. There are still many to come so stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks :</p>\n<p>Just a last thank you for anybody that supports this project and future projects to come. We arent asking a lot. Our one dollar a game project will keep our bellies full and our creative juices flowing to give you even better and more polished games in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f914b1444c18d06dd379f7c477485624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SiLeNTeK Game Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
