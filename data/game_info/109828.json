The goal was to create a game that was relatively short (only 10 levels), but gave a lot of options in terms of strategy.  There are many different ways to play, and the solutions for success are varied.  The game has a variety of classes, traits, alchemy, gods, etc, such that no two playthroughs are alike.  I am solely releasing this here for posterity, such that the game continues to exist in the fabric of the internet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb937b7cee1321ba3a6915e1b04aa3ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kraflab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
