{"id": 441219, "slug": "barrel-melon", "name": "Barrel & Melon", "name_original": "Barrel & Melon", "description": "<p><strong>Game built for MiniJam #53. Executable version recommended for controller support.</strong></p>\r\nBarrel &amp; Melon\r\n<p>A silly co-op platformer in which you have to help each other run through a vicious desert to replenish your water supplies at the nearest oasis. This game was built in about 52 hours, starting late because lack of ideas, and ending early due to lack of sleep!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>In co-op mode, use WASD (ZQSD works too) to move player 1 (Barrel), and the arrows to move player 2 (Watermelon). If controllers are connected, the first one will move player 2 (to allow WASD + controller) and the second one player 1.</p>\n<p>In solo mode, use WASD to move and Tab to switch between Barrel &amp; Watermelon. Currently the game is fully playable in solo mode, but further updates may require tricky coordination.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You can head off to the left of the map to discover a nice pit of torture allowing you to test all the mechanics, but here's a quick summary of each character's abilities:</p>\n<ul><li>Barrel is immune to spikes and cacti, but can get electrocuted</li><li>Watermelon can jump 1 block higher than Barrel, and is immune to electricity</li><li>Both will die if they fall in lava. Obviously.</li></ul>\n<p>There is also a water gauge at the bottom, which decreases with time (and with each jump!), you can refill it when at an oasis.</p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<p>No particularly bad ones.. But hitboxes are a bit wonky, and standing on the edge of another player can cause some glitches. To ensure safety, don't stand on the edge of your friend's head.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bb47b82f9b03f3aaa39e76d5afbca6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Zeroji"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
