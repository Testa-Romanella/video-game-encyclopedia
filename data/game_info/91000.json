You are visited by a noble woman and, almost out of the blue, her maid and yours start FIGHTING!

By moving into the mansion, you signed yourself to represent your maid in the never-ending Maid Games.</em></p><p><em>The battle between the maids ends in a draw and the noblewoman gives you one week to train your maid up to par.
