So many terrible conversations about ugly babies, meaningless busy-work, and the weather. How banal...<br/></p>\n<p>Well, it's not done, but what is here is a pretty view of what the game could be! An arcade style dialog based RPG about all the stupid conversations we have in the office.<br/></p>\n<p>It's only my second game ever built, but I'm glad I tried. I learned a lot, and hope to keep on working on it and making it better. A HUGE thanks to rbatistadelima for their awesome Anime RPG Tilepack from which I borrowed heavily. And thanks to\u00a0Void for 1980 the font.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b26/b261225b5ff1a91e08e78047fe143aec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahndhi"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
