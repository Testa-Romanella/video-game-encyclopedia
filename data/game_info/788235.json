It was created back in 2017 as part of my Honours degree in Digital Arts, and was my first attempt at game making, so please bear that in mind XD.</p>\n<p>While I didn't intend for it to be scary initially, I have gotten feedback that it can be quite tense to play, so just something to be aware of if you're sensitive to that sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! For an in-depth breakdown of the game and its elements, check out the vid below:</p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to play this :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T13:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/6165e0b987ad4a504b8b3596521c6505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShannonBennetts"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
