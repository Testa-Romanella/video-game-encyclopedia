{"id": 441923, "slug": "5-past-worlds-end", "name": "5 Past World's End", "name_original": "5 Past World's End", "description": "<p>[------------ DESCRIPTION ------------]<br/></p>\n<p>A game developed in 7 days as a challenge to myself. The inspiration<br/>for the game was obtained from the game jam theme generator, and the<br/>first thing that came up was: The World Ends in 5 Minutes</p>\n<p>So, you are a time engineer, responsible for overlooking and maintaining<br/>the world clock, a clock that tells the world's time (in the literal<br/>sense, as in, if you change the clock the time of the world changes).<br/>In your latest turn, you overslept, and the clock malfunctioned, when<br/>you woke up, the clock was at 5 minutes to midnight for the second<br/>time in the same day... Now, you have to engage the clock safety<br/>recovery system, which is, for some reason, a set of five levers<br/>protected with security puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No time to waste, go save the world!</p>\n<p>[------------ HOW TO PLAY ------------]<br/>- esc = pause / unpause / exit puzzle<br/>- w/a/s/d = walk / navigate options<br/>- e = interact / select</p>\n<p>When the game starts there is a timer of 5 minutes and 5 levers beneath it.<br/>The objective is to press all the 5 levers, but in order to unlock each lever,<br/>you have to complete a small puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 5 puzzles that can be found around the room and each puzzle unlocks a\u00a0<br/>single lever. Beware, leaving or losing a puzzle will grant you a penalization<br/>of 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>GUESSING SEQUENCE:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 There is a sequence of 4 numbers, and one is hidden. Select the correct number<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 from the options given below</p>\n<p>NAVIGATION:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 There are to round entry tubes, rotate the remaining pipes in order to form<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 a path for the water from the starting entry point to the exit point</p>\n<p>MEMORY SEQUENCE:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 A sequence will play using the keys \"w/a/s/d\", after the sequence has ended,<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 repeat it</p>\n<p>LEVER ORDER:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 A series of 5 levers that must all be turned on in 15 seconds to proceed. The<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 levers may activate/deactivate others so you have to find the order in which<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 to press them</p>\n<p>REACTION EVENT:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 A sequence of 8 keys (\"w/a/s/d\") will pass from on end of the screen to the<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 other. You have to press them timely while they are inside the green cursor in<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 the middle, otherwise the puzzle fails</p>\n<p>[------------ NOTES ------------]<br/></p>\n<p>The game is somewhat unfinished, but the challenge was for 7 days. However, if I receive comments with feedback and ideas I'll be sure to improve the game on next releases, after all, I still want to have a final release at 1.0.0 xP</p>\n<p>[------------ CREDITS ------------]<br/>Engine/Framework<br/>- LOVE 2D, by Anjo, Bartbes, Rude, Slime and Vrld; https://love2d.org/</p>\n<p>Programming<br/>- Wentbinary</p>\n<p>Design<br/>- Wentbinary</p>\n<p>Graphics<br/>- Wentbinary</p>\n<p>Animations<br/>- Wentbinary</p>\n<p>Fonts<br/>- PixelOperatoMono8; by Jayvee Enaguas; https://www.dafont.com/pt/jayvee-d-enaguas.d2725?l[]=10<br/>- PixelOperatoMono8-Bold; by Jayvee Enaguas; https://www.dafont.com/pt/jayvee-d-enaguas.d2725?l[]=10</p>\n<p>Sounds<br/>- (modified) footsteps; by florianreichelt; https://freesound.org/people/florianreichelt/<br/>- (modified) Metal Lever 1; by timgormly; https://freesound.org/people/timgormly/<br/>- 8-bit Error; by SamsterBirdies; https://freesound.org/people/SamsterBirdies/<br/>- select3; by bumpelsnake; https://freesound.org/people/bumpelsnake/; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/>- (modified) Game Sound Correct; by Bertrof; https://freesound.org/people/Bertrof/; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/>- Do; by TheMineWay; https://freesound.org/people/TheMineWay/<br/>- Re; by TheMineWay; https://freesound.org/people/TheMineWay/<br/>- Mi; by TheMineWay; https://freesound.org/people/TheMineWay/<br/>- Fa; by TheMineWay; https://freesound.org/people/TheMineWay/<br/>- (modified) Ticking Clock, A; by InspectorJ; https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Inspirations<br/>- https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/ - theme: The World Ends in 5 Minutes</p>\n<p>[------------ LICENSE ------------]<br/></p>\n<p>This product is licensed under a creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International\u00a0<br/>license, and each external resource used is licensed under their own terms and belonging to the\u00a0<br/>respective owners.</p>\n<p>More details can be found here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8a/f8aab996ce288623832bf76522f39ddb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WentBinaryGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
