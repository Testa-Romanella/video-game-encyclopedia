A cell may contain only one card.<br/>+ The longest sequence of cards you can move during a single operation is equal to the number of empty cells plus one. However, this number doubles for every empty tableau available (notice though that when moving the cards to an empty tableau, then that tableau is not counted). The reason is that an empty tableau acts like an extra empty cell, yet it can add multiple cards on it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:26:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b889e4a9f199d0d5d18a70a87cc993e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Shaoqing Cen"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Shaoqing Cen"], "esrb_rating": null}
