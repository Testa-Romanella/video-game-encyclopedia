The players goal is to explore and escape the dungeon with as much gold as possible. The dungeon is ruthless however and danger will lurk behind every corner. The gameplay is largely focused around rng-based text events, exploration with a top-down perspective, some looting elements and card based combat. </p>\n<p>Can you grow powerful and lucky enough to make it out with the immeasurable riches?</p>\n<p>This is a small personal project that serves as a prototype for future development. Feel free to give me feedback and your opinion on what I can improve. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T05:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/081/0812d7563d4bb3759438388ac2511fc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heimer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
