I'd just completed a second game with \u2014 yet another \u2014 innovative but custom-made system. The next horizon for me was to adapt a literary short story. My excitement was at an all-time high.</p>\n<p>What I <em>did</em> manage to finish was <em>terrible</em>. It stunk!\u00a0I felt frustrated and disappointed with myself.\u00a0If you've ever tried to adapt a short story to interactive fiction, then this admission might not surprise you.</p>\n<p>This is my second attempt. But this time?</p>\n<p>This time I demolished everything I knew about interactive storytelling, cleared the rubble, and reconstructed on top of\u00a0everything I learned about literature in the past two years.</p>\n<p>This is just a glimpse of what I built. I hope you like it.</p>\r\nContent Notice\r\n<p>Please be advised this short story contains mature themes and discussions about living and dying.
