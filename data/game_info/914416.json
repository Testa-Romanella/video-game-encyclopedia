{"id": 914416, "slug": "erwin-dilute-studios", "name": "ERWIN (Dilute Studios)", "name_original": "ERWIN (Dilute Studios)", "description": "<p>Erwin is a single-player puzzle game with co-op components. The idea is to play levels that would normally only be solvable in pairs, alone with the help of a rewind mechanism. To do this, the player first starts a level alone and plans ahead, then rewinds time and solves the level cooperatively with his past. The level design makes use of familiar co-op elements, such as buttons that can be activated, portable crates, jumping plates and much more. In total, the game contains 16 different levels.<br/></p>\n<p>Third Party Assets:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PK25MSWVDxXaNdhOugG7tIKKtjIUGaq9lY2TIjgx-AI/...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T13:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/951/95131db3ffcc717f6e6578c3da2c173e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dilute Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
