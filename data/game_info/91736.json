On the one hand, I want to develop the game in public and distribute the in-development version for free, so I can get feedback from as many people as possible, but on the other hand, I don't want to make the final version free (as I have to eat, too). Therefore, I'm offering the free pre-alpha via my website, as a demo on Steam and also here on itch.io. :) <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Like said above, development is currently put on hold.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOrcish inn is a tavern simulation game in which you take the role of an innkeeper starting out in unsettled lands. You gather resources, farm all sorts of crops like hops and oat, brew your own beers, construct a tavern piece by piece and welcome various orcish clans to your very own place. The game interweaves aspects of management and simulation with those of survival and exploration.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FARMING Plant and harvest various types of crops like hops, oat, sugar-beets, tomatoes and many more, which are then sold, eaten or used as beer flavor.</li>\n<li>BREWING Brew your own types of beer and influence your guests by defining the beers' taste, tint brightness, full body, bitterness, alcoholic strength and flavor.</li>\n<li>PRODUCING Gather and process resources, like chopping trees for logs and process them into lumber planks and decorative planks spent in building and crafting.</li>\n<li>CONSTRUCTING Construct buildings like brewing facilities, taverns or dorm rooms by putting down walls and floors and decorate the created rooms with crafted furniture.</li>\n<li>SERVING Serve the visiting orcish clans by fulfilling their wishes, fine-tune prices or the beer's taste or risk getting battered in a huge pub brawl.</li>\n<li>AND MORE Raise and breed animals like pigeons, which swirl around and bring back useful items, or wrest valuable treasures from the ocean with your fishing rod. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is in development since 2014 and the unfinished pre-alpha is currently available for free. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you have any questions, feel free to ask here on itch.io or via mail (info@stevencolling.com).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3e/f3e53b1c9534c1297f97d78f2afa6ca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Steven Colling"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
