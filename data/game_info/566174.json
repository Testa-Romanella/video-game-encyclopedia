Made in 72 hours. The jam had the theme \"One Big Party\".</p>\n<p>A puzzle crossover party game! Match lines and colors in a chaotic sensory overload as the number of rules in play steadily rises. Use bombs, fireworks and wildcards wisely as the difficulty ramps up, and set off a chain reaction that utilizes all available rule sets!</p>\n<p>I kinda gave up two days in after realizing this concept just doesn't work in practice, so it's not too in-depth. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T08:23:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f7561355a40b858a3da2b889c3363275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
