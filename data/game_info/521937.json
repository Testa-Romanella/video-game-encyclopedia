But beware! Every time you loop around the planet you have less time to do it again, and the levels become more complex every time.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Run by swinging your hands like you are running. Jump by throwing your hands into the air. Step left and right or duck to avoid running into obstacles.</p>\n<p>The game is build to run on VR device like the Oculus Quest and doesn't run on mobile or desktop.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Big thanks to all my Twitch supporters.
