There are no additional in-game purchases: once it's yours, you can begin tackling it until you reach the end. Maybe it\u2019s time to take a break from playing games for other people.<br/><br/>[Key features of ALPHA]<br/>\u25ce A single-player action shooting game. Quite a challenging one, in fact.<br/>\u25ce Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)<br/>\u25ce Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.<br/>\u25ce No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.<br/>\u25ce When it\u2019s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won\u2019t be getting it easy!<br/>\u25ce Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.<br/><br/>SPEC<br/>playstile:single person<br/>Genre:Action<br/>Rating:CERO[A],ESRB[E+]<br/>Languages:Japanese,English,Chinese Simplified<br/>Developer:KANAME.co,.ltd.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T02:37:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/955/95536a847716313477ea383c7210a851.jpg", "website": "https://alpha.kanamekey.com/index_en.html#!page2", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KANAME.co,.ltd."], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["KANAME.co,.ltd."], "esrb_rating": null}
