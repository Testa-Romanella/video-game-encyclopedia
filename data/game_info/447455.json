{"id": 447455, "slug": "super-sloth", "name": "Super Sloth", "name_original": "Super Sloth", "description": "<p>Super Sloth is a simple single player game, where you must try to defend the trees of the rain forest as long as possible against the lumberjacks who come from both the left and right side of the region. This can be done by swinging from tree to tree and smacking them. When you swing from one to another tree, you must be careful to not fall on the ground, because the sloth is not able to climb back up quickly. If you can't reach the other tree you can also prevent falling on the ground by bouncing on the rafflesia flowers. If all trees are cut the game ends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>\u2190\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move or swing left<br/>\u2192\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Move or swing right<br/>\u2191 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Climb up on a vine (rarely used)<br/>\u2193 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Slide down on a vine<br/>Space bar\u00a0\u00a0 Grab or release a vine</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This game may not work properly on windows 8.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:33:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae5e14732f580ec8fa6fbeb17e88535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snorro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
