Peaceful as ever, this</strong><strong>domain was kept whole by a magnificent piece of stone. The rainbow</strong><strong>stone, a high and might pillar which fed the land of Onyros its color, which</strong><strong>kept things running and their inhabitants happy.</strong><strong>However, one day, the stone shattered. Nobody knew why it happened or\u00a0</strong><strong>who had committed such hideous crime, but one thing was for certain.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The land was turning and the once cheerful place was slowly turning much\u00a0</strong><strong>darker and sad. It all started when the buildings began losing color and\u00a0</strong><strong>even the sky turned a monotonous shade of gray. Soon after, the people\u00a0</strong><strong>too began slowly losing their very essence. No more laughing, no more\u00a0</strong><strong>playing around, no more dreaming.\u00a0</strong><strong>The city turned on itself and, without much for answer, dreams turned to\u00a0</strong><strong>nightmares. The habitants also changed. They stopped going to work, they\u00a0</strong><strong>stopped having ambitions and taking care of each other. Little by little all\u00a0</strong><strong>of them would fall into the same pattern. Despair.\u00a0</strong><strong>However, our soon to become hero, would change everything. On the\u00a0</strong><strong>very same day the stone broke, he was there to watch. He saw it first\u00a0</strong><strong>hand, which also, luckily, gave him something else. The stone had powers\u00a0</strong><strong>and, therefore, so did its fragments. Curious as he was, our hero grabbed\u00a0</strong><strong>one of the bits from the ground and, almost in a flashed, something too\u00a0\u00a0</strong><strong>changed in him. Color. He turned into someone or, rather, something else.\u00a0</strong><strong>Soon after a voice echoed inside his head, a plead for help, almost. The\u00a0</strong><strong>mysterious, wailing voice told our hero about what had happened and\u00a0</strong><strong>what is mission or, in this specific case, purpose would be. He was to\u00a0</strong><strong>collect the lost fragments of the stone, one final effort it had made, in\u00a0</strong><strong>hopes someone would find them and save the land of Onyros from the\u00a0</strong><strong>upcoming nightmare. Now, with one in hand, he was also told about the\u00a0</strong><strong>fantastic powers each piece of stone held and, of course, about certain\u00a0</strong><strong>responsibilities he had to carry.\u00a0</strong><strong>With revigorated fervor, the once insignificant creature now had a much\u00a0</strong><strong>bigger mission on his hands. Saving the world is no easy task, but he\u00a0</strong><strong>wouldn\u2019t tremble, after all, sometimes, all you need to wake up from a\u00a0</strong><strong>nightmare is a little push.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T12:06:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/5813c5b3312860d32ef7e532ceb1f086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Ferreira"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
