It happened so quickly that news channels and radio stations stopped before they could get information out to explain what was happening. In Creede, Colorado, the National Guard arrived to build a shelter for the remaining population in the area.</p>\n\n<p>One night, they left. After that, no one has disappeared in over a month. You are Calvin Hetch, an ex-military park ranger that seems to be the only authority figure left in Creede. After a man goes missing, everyone assumes it's happening again. It's up to you to get people to the shelter and possibly find out what is happening and why it's happening</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vast open world</li><li>character interaction</li><li>living environment</li><li>day and night system</li><li>dynamic wind system</li><li> crafting</li><li>survival elements</li><li>equipment system\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/590b970a26a8647c473bd7f9c1dd21b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NexGenGamingStudio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
