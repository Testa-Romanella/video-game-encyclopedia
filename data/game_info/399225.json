There are still so many secrets to be discovered here... what will you find on your journey?</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Q: What original content did you create for this game?<br/>A: The log sprite, the character of Sierra, all of the code, all of the design &amp; the user interface, the sound effects, and the story. We don't take credit for any of the rest of this game's content.</p>\n<p>Q: Why did you make this?<br/>A: It's our contribution to the remarkable fan community of\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em>! Even though this is nothing official or formal, it's fan content like this that helps keep the communities of the franchises we love alive. After all\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em> has done for us, this is our way of saying \"thank you.\"</p>\n<p>Q: What music is used in this game?<br/>A: The original Laura Palmer's theme by\u00a0Angelo Badalamenti. We reorchestrated it, but it's still his melody. The ambient background music that plays early in the game is the same track, just without the melody.</p>\n<p>Q: What doesn't belong to you?<br/>A: The world of\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em>, the images of the characters and locations used in this story, the theme music, and everything else we didn't create. The world of <em>Twin Peaks</em> and its content\u00a0belong to its creators and those who hold rights to it, not us.\u00a0All trademarks are the property of their respective owners and are used for fanfiction purposes only.</p>\n<p>Q: Is this\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em> canon?<br/>A: No. Some of the situations and story elements referenced in the dialogue come from\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em> canon, but this game and its original story are fan<strong>fiction</strong>.</p>\n<p>Q: Do you accept donations or payment?<br/>A: Absolutely not. Out of respect to all the people whose hard work created the universe of\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em>, the actors whose images are portrayed in this game (in the form of the character profiles), and (of course)\u00a0the law, we don't accept any form of compensation for this game whatsoever. If it really inspired you that much, then go out and make something of your own!\u00a0Keeping the\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em> love alive is reason enough to make stuff like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Q: I'm having trouble beating this game.<br/>A: Check out the guide below.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Out of necessity, this guide contains minor story and gameplay spoilers. We don't recommend reading it unless you're having trouble with the game.</p>\n<p>SPEAK:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>In SPEAK phases, you get to talk to classic <em>Twin Peaks</em> characters. Simply click on the option that you would like to say. There are no right or wrong answers.</li><li>Every time a character talks, you either get three options to reply, or the \"Next\" button lights up. Make sure you check both of these to progress your conversation.</li></ul>\n<p>MEND:</p>\n<ul><li>In MEND phases, characters will ask you questions that will test your knowledge of medium to difficult\u00a0<em>Twin Peaks</em> trivia. Look for a question in what the character has said, and type your reply in the input box in the bottom left of the interface.</li><li>If you don't know the answer to a question, all of the answers can be found on the Twin Peaks wiki, and probably a dozen other places on the internet.</li></ul>\n<p>RAISE:</p>\n<ul><li>In RAISE phases, you must use your log to catch every BOB on the screen. Move your log with WASD or the arrow keys, and collide with a BOB to catch and eliminate him.\u00a0Moving your log off one end of the screen will send it to the other (like PacMan). BOB can move the same way.</li><li>To ensure seamless transitions, there is a small area outside the bounds of the screen. It is possible for BOB to \"hide\" here, bouncing back and forth from top/bottom or left/right.\u00a0<strong>BOB cannot escape!</strong> If you're \"stuck\" in a RAISE phase, move your log just past the edge of your screen and work your way around the perimeter. BOB is there somewhere!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dedication</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In loving memory of\u00a0Catherine Elizabeth Coulson. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:56:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/01535c6d30924225513ab2feb59c9884.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alec Ochowski", "Cass Aleatory"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
