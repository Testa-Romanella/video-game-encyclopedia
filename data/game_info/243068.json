We had 48 hours and the theme \"Good Old Days\" to make anything we wanted.\u00a0</p>\n<strong><em>GamePlay / General info \u00a0:</em></strong>\n<p>Face your friends in this little cowboy versus game! It's a quick arcade game, a game take less than 5 min. During this time you become <em>Pedro Enrico Sanchez</em> aka Bob or <em>Billy \u00a0Boy</em> the Sheriff. All the gameplay is based on 3-boutons QTEs. Whoever completes his first, shoots first and wins a round in the Best-of-13 match. This game is totally free so try it and give us your feedback about it (possible improvements, your thoughts, etc...). We are more than willing to fix gameplay and visual bugs we could not find based on the feedback we get.</p>\n<strong><em>Team :</em></strong>\n<p>Etienne 'Queen' Vantorre (major) \u00a0: GameDesign / Manager<br/>Arthur 'TheThird' Galland : GameDesign / Dev<br/>Simon 'PixelGod' Vernus : GameArt<br/>Marion 'PauseCookieclicker' B\u00e9tremieux \u00a0: GameArt<br/>Ali\u00e9nor 'CutiePie' Tignon :\u00a0 Game Art<br/>Matis 'DjSet' Duperray : Gamedesign / \u00a0SoundDesign<br/>R\u00e9mi 'ScreamsShots' S\u00e9cher : Dev<br/>Guillaume 'boordaf' Faguet : SFX (https://soundcloud.com/boordaf)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Hope you will like it!
