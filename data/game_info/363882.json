The player is supposed to be this brain squid thing that\u00a0control anything in their line of sight, but will need to strategically position their pawns so that they can make it to the end goal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, i ran short on time. I\u00a0implemented the core of the game mechanics, but didn't have time to create any kind of meaningful levels. Hopefully what i have here demonstrates the mechanics well enough.</p>\n<p>Please watch the walkthrough above\u00a0if you get stuck. Unfortunately, there are a number of ways to softlock the game currently. Try not to walk off any ledges.<br/></p>\n<p>All assets and code, including 3D models and animations were created in the 48 hours of the competition.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12d96a0ebb3ad88a47fa1a554a2609f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AltAlias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
