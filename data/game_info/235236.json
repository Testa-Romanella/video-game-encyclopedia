Spider is one of the most played patience games in the world. Now you can enjoy it anytime, and anywhere, on your mobile phone or tablet. Share your Spider scores with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.<br/><br/>From Odesys, the makers of the best solitaire games for mobile.<br/><br/>The goal of Spider Solitaire is to arrange all cards into complete suits in descending order from King to Ace. Every complete suit of 13 cards is discarded automatically as soon as it is created. The board consists of 10 stacks and a stock. Moves to a stack must be made in descending order regardless of suit. Any card can be moved to an empty slot. A sequence of properly ordered cards of the same suit can be moved together.<br/><br/>Odesys Spider Features:<br/>\u2022 Three levels of difficulty - One, Two and Four suits<br/>\u2022 Bonus games - Black Widow and Tarantula<br/>\u2022 Landscape and portrait orientation<br/>\u2022 Unlimited undo and redo<br/>\u2022 Solvable deals only mode<br/>\u2022 Adjustable cards size (pinch-to-resize)<br/>\u2022 Sound<br/>\u2022 Animations<br/>\u2022 Hints<br/>\u2022 Auto save on exit<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @OdesysSolitaire<br/><br/>Look for other great patience games by Odesys.
