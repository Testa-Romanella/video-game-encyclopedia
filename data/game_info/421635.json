(I have no creativity)<br/></p>\n<p>Keep the fish bouncing as long as possible until you catch it! The further you get, the faster they fall and bounce! But also the smaller your platform gets!</p>\n<p>My best friend has always been obsessed with playing the fishing minigames when playing anything. He refuses to do anything else.<br/>So I thought I'd make him a game solely focussed on fishing. Something fun, something challenging, something...like this?</p>\n<p>I had a fun time making this game. I made it in about 10 hours and then started adding and tweaking things. I'd love to add more if anyone wants me to!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c90e231e752be4e01402e3d32a212ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheShelfman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
