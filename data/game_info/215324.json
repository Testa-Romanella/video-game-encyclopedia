{"id": 215324, "slug": "hotel-manager", "name": "Hotel Manager", "name_original": "Hotel Manager", "description": "<p><strong>The Vision</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hotel Manager is a 3D simulation game for PC and mobile platforms. The player has to manage his hotel by extending it with rooms, decorations and features, employing staff, and by attracting guests. The goal is to get your hotel rated with 5 stars without going bankrupt.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your Mission</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your job is to build up your own hotel, attract guests and satisfy them to earn reputation points and money. The more reputation points your hotel has, the more guests will be attracted and the heavier their wallet will be. With the money you've earned you're able to upgrade and extend your hotel with new rooms, new furnishings and new floors for even more rooms 'n stuff. Besides the normal rooms you can also build special rooms for parties, business meetings and more.<br/>If you've earned enough reputation points, you'll earn a desirable star. You need five of them to win a game. But if you want to continue the game, of course, you're allowed to do so :)</p>\n<p><strong>Planning</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The game is currently under heavy development. I'm working on the prototype (see screenshot above) which will be available for public testing soon. Before the release of the playable prototype I'll publish a roadmap for it. Same with the planned final game as well as for the future planning (yes, it already exists!).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>I want to play the game!</strong></p>\n<p>Patience, my friend. It is done when it's done. I don't think you want to play an unfinished game, do you?</p>\n<p><strong>I want to support the development!</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to support the development you could do this in different ways. First off: Every project needs feedback! Without feedback the game will be released as a pile of crap. So <strong>your feedback</strong> is important! You could provide your feedback on the Community Page.</p>\n<p>If you want to support the game financially please have a look at my Patreon page.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/822/822fbec803a77b36cc879d8c9944a9eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnkelMorph"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
