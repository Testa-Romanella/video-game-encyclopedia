Each new element on the  board morphes after a couple seconds and splits into 2 new elements.  After 100 elements morphed the game ends, for every 2 elements you  combine you get points. Challenge yourself and hunt all the achievments  or play multiplayer against other people. Multiplayer follows the same  game principles but for each elements you combine the enemy player  spawns an additional element on their board. Slow down time or use bombs  to get an even higher score.\r\n- Singleplayer\r\n- Multiplayer\r\n- Global Leaderboards (only on android)- Achievmens (only on android)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T06:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/914/914a16727f911f0021035e1702aa6fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["fortytwoboxes"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
