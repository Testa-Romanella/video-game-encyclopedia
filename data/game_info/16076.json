The game is about getting from one side of the screen to the other without dying. This might sound easy enough but a single touch from a spike will instantly kill you and send you back to the start of the level.<br/><br/>All levels consists of a single static screen filled with hazards. If you think you have what it takes, give it your best shot. This game is not to be considered easy.<br/><br/>The story is told with the help of signs placed in the levels and it progresses as you complete levels and get further. If you rather just focus on the gameplay you can ignore the story all together, the choice is yours.<br/><br/>The recommended input method is a good gamepad/controller but keyboard works just as well if you prefer it.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game Features<ul><li>Challenging Gameplay<br/></li><li>Level Editor with workshop integration<br/></li><li>Play user created levels<br/></li><li>Achievements<br/></li><li>Leaderboards<br/></li><li>Cloud saves (cross platform)<br/></li><li>Jumping<br/></li><li>Full Gamepad Support (Xbox 360 tested)<br/></li><li>Auto Save System (Continue on level you quit on)<br/></li><li>A Bar<br/></li><li>Booze Powerups (Dont drink &amp; drive kids)<br/></li><li>Varied Level Design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d1823340ce6987c0a7807a02e7c3ef0f.jpg", "website": "http://teamjape.com/games/jumper_jape.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Johan W\u00e5ngsell", "Jacob Torr\u00e5ng"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Team Jape"], "esrb_rating": null}
