The meteors appeared as if from the void, bypassing all our defenses before they could even engage. Their interdimensional edges tore through our hull like leaves in a heavy wind.\u00a0Somehow, you were able to survive the wreckage and now is up to you, young one, to find out the mysterious machinations of the assault against our ancient order.</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the development of Radiance of Anthakkar.
