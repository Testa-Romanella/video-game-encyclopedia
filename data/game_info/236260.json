{"id": 236260, "slug": "codename-peg-leg-023", "name": "Codename Peg-leg 0.23", "name_original": "Codename Peg-leg 0.23", "description": "<p>Codename Peg-Leg is an action sidescroller featuring simple gameplay and a bold visual style that's a little bit minimalist and a little bit retro. The art style and gameplay will be different on release but have a similar feel and still be easy to pick up. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Changes from the last demo include:</p>\n<ul><li>Larger and somewhat different map</li><li>New background</li><li>Scrolling boundaries are consistent and other scrolling fixes</li><li>Controller fixes, mostly focused on analog sticks</li><li>Fall stun is visible-- yellowish outline and face change</li><li>Fall damage and fall are stun consistent and more forgiving</li><li>Powerup fixes</li><li>Getting on stairs is more responsive</li><li>Game now starts paused and with a welcome message</li><li>Player has a health bar</li><li>Dead enemies block the player but don't cause damage (until they're removed)</li><li>Lantern improvement</li></ul>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Some minor control issues, particularly when exiting the pause menu</li><li>Going to full screen makes the game hang for a bit-- it sorts itself out after 5-6 seconds</li><li>The game has no proper ending or built-in restart beyond dying</li></ul>\n<p>You can choose to walk past stairs or get on them. To get on stairs, use the up or down arrow when at the bottom or top of the stairs. The powerup at the end still applies after dying, but not after restarting the game.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Currently I'm looking for feedback on the feel of the controls and movement, suggested gameplay mechanics, and the visuals and style. Audio and several suggested tweaks are forthcoming. Bug reports and suggested fixes are very appreciated. Please be specific about any problem you have, whether it's a bug or not.</p>\n<p>If you want to help this game look better, <em>please</em> contact me (preferably via comments the first time). I'm willing to pay for art and to sign a contract for it.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls can be changed to virtually anything.
