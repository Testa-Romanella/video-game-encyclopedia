The landscape was all done in Houdini. In addition, the trees and rocks were done in Houdini, and we also used Houdini to quickly UV unwrap some of our other assets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>List everything that was made before the jam. Pre-built, assets, textures, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>The only thing we didn't make were some of the sound effects used in the game. We found them on freesound.org.\u00a0Everything else (including the\u00a0music, art, assets, textures, and gameplay) was created during the jam</p>\n<p><strong>Which game engine or platform did you use to make your game?</strong>\r\nUnreal Engine 5</p>\n<p><strong>Besides Houdini, what other tools did you use to make your game?</strong>\u00a0Autodesk Maya for the buildings and creatures, Substance Painter and Designer for the textures, Beepbox for the music, Photoshop for the UI and Concept Art.</p>\n<p><strong>List instructions and tips for playing your game here.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your objective: survive the night. Throughout the day you can gather resources and build helpful and defensive\u00a0buildings to prepare for night. As night falls, hungry monsters start looking for a snack. Can you survive the night and make it to a new dawn?<br/>-Move with WASD<br/>-Build with Shift and Scroll Wheel<br/>-F Zooms in and Out <br/>-Use Space to Pick Up Resources from your buildings and any resources you may find on the ground</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e0cc766ad60cb02a74bf50afdcd04dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MacMcColor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
