Although the game play, story, and graphical style mimic RPGs of that era, Victim Cache: The RPG features mature humor, themes, and language.<br/><br/>The gameplay is modeled after classic JRPGs. Players can move their characters  up, down, left, or right on a  top down 2D map to explore the  8-bit towns, dungeons,  and overworld. Along the way, players must talk to archetypal non-player characters to advance the quest lines. Battles are fought from a side view perspective in which the player can choose to attack, cast a spell, execute a special attack, use an item, or later in the game summon additional allies to help. Battles are won when all enemies hit points have reached zero.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/359/35929b44af904e1c1ee9aa264ce04002.jpg", "website": "https://www.victimcache.com/the-rpg/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Victim Cache"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Victim Cache"], "esrb_rating": null}
