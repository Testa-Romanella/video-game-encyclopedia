This game features the gridshot and spidershot that AimLab has but only slightly worse.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Practice your aim and prove that you can also become a pro player and join the esports team. 2D AimLab has collaborated with many Esport teams 100Thieves, Cloud 9, NRG Esport, and NiP (of course this is just a joke), Practice your aim with 2D AimLab right now!</p>\n\n<p>We really care about our community, you can give ideas through comments or the community tab we are trying to reach you if we think your ideas are good and we will implement them in the game.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><em>I made this game just for a joke but instead became my main project.
