There are no menus, not even a start button, you're just straight in.<br/><br/>Click the small \"i\" button to access options, which are 1 or 2 player, and Easy, Medium or Hard (1 player only).<br/><br/>You can switch between 1 and 2 player mode at any time and even change difficulty level in the middle of a game (great if you are struggling to beat Mr Chess Pro).<br/><br/>Playing against Mr Chess Pro in 1 player mode, Easy level is perfect for beginners. Medium provides a challenge for most normal players, and Hard will defeat all but the best players.<br/><br/>Mr Chess Pro is beautifully designed and very minimalist, in keeping with the Mr Board Game philosophy. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Now with Castling! Note, when castling, move you king, and your rook will move automatically.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a74/a74661bcefb31b5c8b57f5315774acb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Truncated Tales"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family"], "publishers": ["Truncated Tales"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
