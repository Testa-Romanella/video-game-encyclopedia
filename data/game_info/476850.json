I own Scary Raven Studios, Jon Jon Games Studios, Inc., Jon Jon Animations, Inc.

I always be adding new characters to the game.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there really in-game achievements?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: YES. Back in 2018 when the original The Lost Neighbor was released, I didn't implement it in because I was a noob in game dev. With 3 years of experience now, I can now implement achievements for my games.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Who voice acted the characters?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: Me.

In near future hopefully to hire a voice actor.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<strong>Is the game Free?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: Yes. Once I make the final product of the game, it will be a priced product. However, I'm looking for Playtesters and Reviewers to test the game out and review it. Reviewers and Playtesters will get early access to the new alpha, beta, demo, and full game for free.\u00a0 More Info on how.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is the game about? What is it inspired by?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: The game is about a YouTube vlogger Mark of Mark'sVlogs who went on a camping trip to this unknown location to record his vlogs and someone kidnapped him and You Play as Elaine and you have to find clues to find your\u00a0neighbor. The game is inspired by TinyBuild's Hello Neighbor but the mechanics were not implemented the same way as Hello neighbor. I implement my own mechanics on how Hello Neighbor would be but different ways. ;) (So I don't get a copyright infringement notice).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I want to support the project where can I Donate?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: There are 2 ways.
