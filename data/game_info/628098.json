Problem is\u2026 these gods are more attractive than she expected! However, she can only choose one, and that\u2019s not all, the town is filled with problems and calamities that must be solved. Each god has its own talents and can help with a specific problem.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Who will you choose? The smartest god? Perhaps the one with the best personality? Or maybe just the biggest muscles? It\u2019s all up to you! See how each of these stories unfold and how to deal with love when it\u2019s immortal!\r\n</p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Poseidon</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Easily the smartest of the gods. He\u2019s the king of the seas, so he spends most of his time underwater, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a fishy guy! He understands life and biology like no other, and loves to read and gather knowledge from all lands and eras. He\u2019s also quite charming and refined.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ares</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let his look deceive you, Ares may be a big boy, but he\u2019s the very definition of a gentle giant. His heart is his biggest muscle! He\u2019s always well-intentioned, though he may be a bit over enthusiastic sometimes. Ares is an expert in combat (he is the god of war after all) but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a stranger to love.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hades</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Easily one of the most misunderstood gods of the pantheon. Being the lord of the dead isn\u2019t an easy task, and most people fear him. That\u2019s why he no longer bothers with humans and prefers to just do his job alone in the underworld. He\u2019s not a bad guy, though. Who knows? Maybe he just needs a little love to melt his icy heart.</p>\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Colorful and interesting characters.\r\n</li><li>Three completely different branching paths.\r\n</li><li>Ending scenes beautifully illustrated.\r\n</li><li>For Windows.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T06:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/281/281a4cbb34132562e23eca9d5d2b9b62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["megalixirgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
