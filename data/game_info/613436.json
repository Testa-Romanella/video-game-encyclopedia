We, the Water Mages, found the location of the crystals that we seeked for centuries. With these crystals, we shall be able to summon the legendary Ice Dragon.</p>\n<p>But we are not alone in the desert. Our foes, the Fire Mages, followed us through the desert. They will do anything to prevent us from summoning the dragon we worship.</p>\n<p>It's my responsibility to collect the crystals as the Archmage. I have a special power: When I'm killed, my soul still wanders.
