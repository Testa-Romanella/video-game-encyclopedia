It will be occasionally updated, but will not have all of the spells available to use as I\u00a0add more to the alpha.\u00a0 If you're interested in the game, please add the full game to a wishlist collection\u00a0and join the game's\u00a0Discord server\u00a0to keep up to date on the game's progress.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Currently the game is currently local multiplayer only, so grab another person to play against and give it a whirl!\u00a0 I've also had some success playing it online\u00a0using\u00a0Parsec, although I know installing an app and giving it permissions to remote stream your computer to play a game isn't ideal, so I hope to add online multiplayer at some point in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything you need to learn how to play the game is available in game, although I've included more detailed spell / spell effect information below.\u00a0 If you need any more info, find anything confusing, want to report a bug or give feedback, or want to find people to play against, please make sure you're in the\u00a0Discord server!\u00a0 If you have any questions on the development of the game, feel free to check out the tentative roadmap on the\u00a0full game's page or ask me in the Discord server.\r\n</p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy the game! (And even if you don't, I\u00a0would still love to hear your feedback!)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Tyler</p>\n<p>P.S. There's no music or sound effects\u00a0right now, so no need to mess with your sound settings if you're wondering why the game is quiet. :)</p>\r\nSpells\r\nSpellMana CostDamageTypeElementDescriptionBoulder Toss\r\n11\r\n20 (Direct Impact) / 2\u00a0(Projectiles)\r\nProjectile / Projectile (Multiple)\r\nEarth\r\nFlings a boulder into the air which shatters on impact, dealing massive damage and spraying out rock shrapnel.\r\nEnergy Ball\r\n5\r\n15 (Direct Impact)\u00a0/ 5 (Explosion)\r\nProjectile\r\nN/A\r\nA projectile that can bounce around and off other Energy Balls.
