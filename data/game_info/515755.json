Get to know the residents of a rural town and prescribe them appropriately hexed and enchanted sweets for their own good, as well as yours - can't stay employed if the customers are unhappy!</em></p>\n<p>This is a short slice of what was a hilariously overscoped \"baby's\u00a0first game jam\" game. I was inspired by the jam theme of sweets, the two-button limitation,\u00a0and a recent playthrough of <em>Atelier Ryza</em> to do the\u00a0concept of a one-screen\u00a0simulation-style game focused on\u00a0cute, tasty, magical items and pleasant slice-of-life\u00a0interactions. For the spooky season and my own artistic limits, I used nondescript humanoid figures\u00a0in simple and colorful paper masks alongside the pastel item art, and for my own satisfaction, there are a wealth of groan-worthy puns.\u00a0\u00a0Enjoy the small bits of worldbuilding, slapdash but\u00a0cute\u00a0aesthetics,\u00a0and glimpses of what's to come in later iterations of this project!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse - move cursor around the screen</p>\n<p>Left click - interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccc/cccbb62f9b1f4fa5e224f3fe746b0526.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bobothefish"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
