That includes the graphics, gameplay elements, music, sound design code and the idea for the game.</p>\n\n<p>The theme was \u201cRoll of the dice\u201d. Therefore, we used the idea of having a world in which you can move by only using a dice. Additionally, you gain advantages by using mystical dice. With these dice you either gain a life or a shield. With these you can defeat the witch.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Witches Dice is a puzzle-adventure game in which you, the adventures, must defeat the witch. \r\n  </p>\n<p>By rolling your magical dice you can move forward or use their magical powers to gain advantages over the witch but be aware that you can only use the magical dice once. During your fight against the witch, you\u00a0must destroy different crystals to deal damage to her. But be aware I heard that she has a second phase in which she destroys her surroundings. During your adventure you will find different obstacles in your way, try to dodge them.\u00a0On your way to defeat the witch you will find many mystery-fields. If you go on these mystery-fields, you gain mystical items to help you on your adventure.</p>\n<p>Good luck on your adventures!</p>\n<p>Made by Moritz von Basum, Tim Stockmann, Alexander Potapov\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fe/0fef80aa8e63260626621122fdc13fb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toasted Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
