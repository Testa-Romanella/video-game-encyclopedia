Fresh game mechanics and harder later levels provide incentive to continue, and the continued reinforcement of \u201cthe bad guy is the good guy\u201d allows players to more easily empathize with a character who\u2019s normally seen as the enemy.</p>\n<p>All assets created by Bayat\u00a0Games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ced335fc439709096c530888ea2bb14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cashel Condon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
