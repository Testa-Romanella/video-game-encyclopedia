So, we decided to make a game that he had designed.\u00a0<br/>The idea is runner game with fast reaction to obstacles. The player need to change between three characters inspired by Jokenpo and each character had a special ability.<br/>The game you are about to play has the same mechanics but fitted to the theme. We add a meta layer to talk about the pressure in workspaces, especially in game development. We had the pretentious to imagine how David Lynch would portray this reality.<br/>The hand that's controlled by the player represents the worker and the labor. The enemy that chases you is the virtual pressure that companies puts workers with deadlines and abuse. The setting is a vintage office with some references to David Lynch movies.</p>\n<p>'Z' and 'X' to change the pose of the hand.<br/>Scissors = fast and cuts soft obstacles<br/>Paper = middle speed and floats in air<br/>Rock = slow speed and pushes hard obstacles<br/>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9e6fbd5aaaa6614ea7af843eab119f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Funbites Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
