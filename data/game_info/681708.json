Long live the New Flesh!\"</em></p>\n<p><em>Max Renn, Videodrome (1983)</em></p>\n<p><strong>This game contains flashing lights which may be triggering to those with photosensitive epilepsy.</strong></p>\n<p>Additional warnings: body horror, illness, medical horror, cartoon gore.</p>\n<p>Created as part of Scream Jam 2021!</p>\n<p>This is a labyrinth-esque game in which a parasite attempts to destroy its host's body from the inside-out. Throughout the game, you see your parasite evolve and gain new abilities, as well as the ways in which your host reacts to you. I used a technique in which I animated brief, 3 to 7 frame animations to give all aspects of the game a \"throbbing\" effect, like everything is organic and heart-like. Keep playing to see your story evolve!</p>\n<p>This game is best experienced with headphones or nice, bassy speakers. The soundtrack to this game can be found on my YouTube channel, or on my Bandcamp.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls: arrow keys, Space</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi03FHg_s4MelSkSrRFgGMQ</p>\n<p>austindearing.bandcamp.com</p>\n<p>(just so you know this is my first game jam, so if you have any advice or tips or critiques I am more than happy to hear them out!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff14ea0e636de7ea5d4678b72b930bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schluppinlife"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
