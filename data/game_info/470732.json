A voyage of discovery in a snazzy bright yellow speedster, through many exotic locations, picking up souvenirs as mementos of your unique experience along the way. In and out of places like nobodies business. What you didn't reckon on was the unfriendly locals in their own speedsters. They're pretty angry that you can't wait to leave their beautiful towns and cities in such a hurry after grabbing what you can. Lord knows your road trippin' days'll be over if they catch up to ya too often. But you're determined to see the whole trip through and return home with all your tacky spoils, asap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Game</p>\n<p>Road Trippin' is a tiny sprite maze game where you go from location to location, driving around, admiring the scenery and collecting a number of souvenirs, whilst avoiding the frenzied locals and other obstacles, for points. Keep an eye on your fuel as you'll lose a speedster should it reach empty. But have no fear, power ups will appear, which give you extra fuel, an extra speedster or extra bonus points. Once you have enough souvenirs you'll receive a bonus for any remaining fuel and then it's on to the next step of your journey. There are many places you've planned to visit on your map. Hopefully you'll get to see them all.</p>\n<p>The Controls</p>\n<p>Q=Up, A-Down, O-Left, P-Right.
