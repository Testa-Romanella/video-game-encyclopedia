There are bugs.<br/>As of now, there is a maximum of 20 players at one time.</strong><br/><br/>Rollout is a multiplayer eat-to-grow, \".io\" style game but, unlike others that you may have played, I've added an extra dimension. The goal is to grow as big as you can while not being eaten. <br/><br/>The rules are simple: Eat anything smaller than you and avoid anything bigger.<strong>Controls:</strong>Aim with mouse<br/>WASD to move<br/>Space to jump when you're big enough<br/>Click to boost when you're big enough<br/>Hold space to climb buildings when you're big enough<br/>Use the scroll wheel to adjust how far the camera can see.
