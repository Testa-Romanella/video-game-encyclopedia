We set out to create a re-playable, fast-paced first-person shooter with a unique art style that players would enjoy. Elysium was developed to be played on PC with keyboard and mouse controls. The player is dropped straight into the action, wielding three unique guns that can be more or less effective on specific enemies. You must navigate the USF Elysium, a colony ship inhabited by hostile robots.</p>\n<p>Nameless Studios is a group of five second-year level 3 game design students from Priestly College. Our team is made up of Ethan Steele, our primary coder who also did some level design, Rhys Nadin and Lloyd Mulvey who were our primary level designers, Tom Bridge who was our primary modeller and Lucy Rodham who worked on art and modelling.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the full development of Elysium all updates can be found at twitter.com/NamelessCGD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:12:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c425ba89d00623f01dc911919784f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PriestleyCGD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
