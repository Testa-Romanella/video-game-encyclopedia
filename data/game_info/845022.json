The base idea was to have a puzzle game, where it is required to look at the world through different mirrors to find the solution. To reduce the scope the only actual mirror like that is a flat water surface, but the concept largely stays the same.</p>\n<p>If this game was well designed the second level would have been one that can be played well in a single session. As it stands i'll just pretend that you're supposed to play it multiple times checking the reflections for where to go and apply this knowledge in the next run(s).\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for basic gameplay - you have to find 3 hidden (only visible in the mirror) fireplaces per level and light all of them to progress. There may or may not be some hidden secrets somewhere that do absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for checking this out, i hope you have an incredible day! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T11:23:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cd3f0c1dac3f7a0f7706427a7ced80e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fl0tto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
