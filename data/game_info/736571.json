The game will mostly take place during the Battle of France (Ardennes, France), where your character will perish. Your character hates the senseless fighting, wishing they could find a way to resolve this peacefully, as opposed to another soldier who's views are the reverse. Both of you will die at the beginning, only to reappear as spirit versions of their beliefs, your goal is to change the influence of all the soldiers (both Anglo-French and German) to resolve this conflict, whilst the evil spirit will do the opposite, escalating the fight more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa4d695cc9f547f3541728d4e4ad6004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikas Eidukas"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
