Your timeship&#39;s first encounter is with ancient 1910 biplanes; you&#39;re outnumbered, but your weapons are superior. Eliminate the entire air fleet; then knock out a mighty zeppelin and you&#39;ll progress to the next stage: 1940 monoplanes. These World War II fighters present a tougher challenge, and if you can defeat them, you&#39;ll move on to 1970 helicopters. Down the choppers and warp ahead to meet 1983 super jets. If you find a way to beat them, you&#39;ll cross the final barrier and head into the future for a deep-space duel with deadly flying saucers from the year 2001!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-20T09:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c9e/c9e210ad2937e2ce5d7bd548afe39076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.7, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 101, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 2", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Digital Eclipse"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
