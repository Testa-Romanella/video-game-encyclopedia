You're now inside the slime itself, which contains a world in itself. Fight the core of the slime world to get back to the real world, but you might want to get stronger before you do. Featuring turn-based combat with light kinaesthetic elements, prove that even if you don't have the raw stats, skill and determination can make up for your shortcomings!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/6328d923d19c57bb5a5330b95be69d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["This_is_how_we_die"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
