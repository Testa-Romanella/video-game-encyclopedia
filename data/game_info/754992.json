Players will play a desperate but firm defender in various historical battles, survive the crazy attack of the enemy, and ensure that the position is always under the control of our army.<h3>Exquisite pixel style</h3>The game uses 2D pixel style, but this does not mean that the picture will look cartoon or unreal.
