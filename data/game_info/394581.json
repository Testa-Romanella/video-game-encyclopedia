We had a grand idea of what we wanted to make, but we didn't understand basic steps to get there. In this game there is no environmental story telling, the objective and directions aren't clear, and its hard to tell what items are important and what aren't. Not to mention the fact that a lot of the physics are wonky and the camera is super disorientating. <br/></p>\n<p>In 2019 I went back and tried to update some major fixes to the game, but not wanting to completely overhaul it I left some of the quirks in (such as the odd camera shift with the maze). But I did want to clean up a lot of performance issues now that I have a better understanding of how Unity works.
