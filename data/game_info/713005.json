Consequently it is really buggy and I am still working out making the AI logic for all the pieces. So far the White King and Black Pawns work as intended.</p>\n<p>Edit: If you get stuck and the piece bugs out, sorry but you have to restart. The queen is really buggy for some reason because of the way GB Studio event handling works, but if you can reach the back rank with it and find yourself in the final level with the king you can press SHIFT to swap the piece you are playing as.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d85/d85d1a49f23c2536ac38f23a64f34e9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["appl2000"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
