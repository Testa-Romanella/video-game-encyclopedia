One of the main attacks is a single ball that you can throw around. This ball is known as a minion and you must pick it up to use it again.</p>\n<p>You can also play this game on a controller. I just didn't write down the inputs for the in game text, but for a PS4 controller, X is jump, square is attack, and triangle is pick up item.</p><p>Github Repo:<br/>https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa21-202-tomato-town<br/></p>\n<p>I do not take credit for any of the music or art assets used in this game.
