Despite the dangers and possibilities of death that come with his missions, Spike handles these kinds of situations calmly. His stoic philosophy allows him to go through the worst experiences and still think clearly in the present. One day he decides he wants to have more personal conversations with strangers.</p>\n<p>The Game:</p>\n<p>In a mix of first-person shooter, dating and arm wrestling simulation, Spike fights his way from one date to another. He makes decisions that completely change his life. He meets people he would never meet in his world and everyday life. People who make him doubt whether his encounters with them are real or just a dream.</p>\n<p>The Background:</p>\n<p>I wanted to realise this game because I was allowed to meet and get to know very many different people. Even a short, unexpected conversation with a stranger could create something magical. Often I asked myself what moments people need to understand each other better and to feel closer connected. Only to finally realise how similar we all are.</p>\n\n<p>COWBOY BEBOP: NOPE\u00a0</p>\n<p>a strange dream by:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jan Schekauski</p>\n<p>with:</p>\n<p>Bill Murray - Nicki Minaj - Albert Einstein - Banksy - Dana Scully - Alfred Hitchcock - Danger Mouse - Andy Kaufman - Catfish - Patrick Bateman / Batman - K\u00e4the Kollwitz - Muhammad Ali - Divine / Dawn - The Blob - Lou and Andy - Nyota Uhura - Klaus Kinski - Motoko Kusanagi - BoJack Horseman - Spike Spiegel - Jan Ski</p>\n\n\n<p>The Features of the Mixtape Game:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Meet 20 different Personalities</li><li>20 different\u00a0Arm Wrestling Battles\r\n</li><li>10 Ego Shooter Stages</li><li>Playable with controllers\r\n</li><li>Free Play</li></ul>\n\n<p>The Controls:</p>\n<p>If you don't want to play it with the gamepad,\u00a0here are the controls for the keyboard.</p>\n<p>A Button: let Spike punch or shoot in the action sections.
