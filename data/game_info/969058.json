Under the disguise of \"I\", no one knows that Xueba and the gangster are the same person. When Niu Tianci studies, Murong Dun needs to help with trivial matters; Murong Dun is in trouble and needs to be solved by heaven.<br/>However, the growth process of young people is full of contradictions: academic pressure, emotional ignorance, desire to understand but more lost, and inner struggle... How will \"I\" get along with myself?<br/><br/><strong>Narrative Style</strong><br/>\"I\" need to control the two bodies on both sides of the screen to do things and talk. The inner monologue will appear at the bottom of the screen, and sometimes it needs to complete interaction and small games.<br/>The story is set in a small town in China more than ten years ago, which recreates the campus life of that year.

Will you reconcile with yourself when you return to your childhood?<br/><br/><strong>The Role of Setting</strong><br/>The characters in the story are also strange and interesting. The contrast between the two bodies is very obvious: heaven sent, serious, but low EQ; Murong Dun is free and lax, and neglects his work.
