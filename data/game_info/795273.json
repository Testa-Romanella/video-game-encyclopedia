The reason behind this is because I am focusing on the Nabataean religion where they had 3 gods of fate, Manat, Allat, AlUzza.<br/></p>\n<p>There are going to be 3 endings to my game\r\n  </p>\n<p>Selflessness (AlUzza) \u2013 you help others around and leave nothing for yourself.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Selfishness (Allat) \u2013 you take actions which benefit your self\r\n  </p>\n<p>Kleptomaniac (Manotu, hidden ending)- you keep all the items, you earned them why should anyone else have them,\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>To Determine challenges the player showing them the effects of there actions and shows them that sometimes being selfless can just be as bad as being selfless. this will hopefully make the player think about their real world choices and if they should maybe start caring for others more or even themselves.\r\n  </p>\n<p>For this game I really wanted the player to explore their own morals so I have drastic differences in the characters design so this also will show how a player will react due to appearance.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T16:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaaf0fbcc8411a6e130ceca065b81e16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["james Thickett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
