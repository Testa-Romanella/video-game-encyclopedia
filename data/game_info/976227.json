The king is dead, the kingdom is in turmoil\u2026 For some, it\u2019s a time of darkness. For others \u2013 a time of opportunity. Play as the Rogue who uses his sword and his wit to deal with anyone who crosses his path. Sometimes he also uses spells. It\u2019s a fantasy game, after all.<br/><br/><h3>Be a rogue, be a hero </h3>You are a rogue. Epic heroes usually just kill your kind for side quests. But not this time. Here, you are the hero. Who says only knights in shining armor can be the Chosen Ones? Time to save the world your way, one knuckle sandwich at a time.<br/>You won\u2019t be alone. Try to gain the respect of a wizard down on his luck, a mad halfling demolitionist, a tough dwarven princess and many others. They might help you on your quests!<br/><br/><h3>Fight fantastic creatures</h3>Set out on a journey to kill the dragon that terrorizes the neighborhood. Fight ugly trolls, grim skeletons and bloodthirsty beavers. Learn spells that will make your enemies tremble. Treat them with fire and ice or simply smash the entire battlefield with a wave of raw magical energy. Tired of magic? Grab your sword and wreak havoc all around.<br/><br/><h3>Complete absurd quests</h3>Complete epic quests and crazy missions, or don\u2019t give a damn about the story and bring chaos to the valleys and villages. Explore the dirty fantasy world on foot, on horseback, on a cart, or on a huge mechanical pig \u2013 because why not? Visit dwarven mines, halfling hamlets, orcish dens\u2026 All that and more spiced up with a ridiculous sense of humor.<br/>After all that hard work, enjoy a suspicious drink with an orcish shaman, burn a bandit camp or two, run around scaring the villagers or see how good the royal guards are at chasing you.  <br/><br/><h3>Mess it all up!</h3>Learn magic from a suspicious wizard who drinks way too many potions. Slay the mighty dragon. Wanna hunt some monsters? Steal a preciouss ring? Kick a necromancer\u2019s bony butt? Say hello to a White Tree in the capital? Mess with myths, legends and tropes however you want. The world lies open before you \u2013 and you\u2019re the hero. The rogue hero.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T02:25:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83aa9d7938b0f53e39483b15b2abf024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic Wolf"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Games Operators", "Atomic Wolf"], "esrb_rating": null}
