The theme of the jam was combining genres, so I decided to combine horror with a top-down shoot em up. This game was inspired by Phasmophobia. In that game, you are tasked with exploring a haunted house and collecting evidence of paranormal activity. Instead of simply slowly exploring the house, I thought it would be more fun if you went in guns blazing, and tried to steal and destroy as much as you possibly can.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I also tried to keep some supernatural and spooky elements to the game, to fulfill the horror aspect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37d29962ee70b7f75d21224b6eaf5af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["S34_M0NST3R"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
