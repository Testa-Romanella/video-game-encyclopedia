I'm very much a beginner in Unity and to programming in general. The game I made is quite basic but I've been using the Udemy course by James Doyle to learn and get better. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out sprites and animations but I've learned a great deal and wish to continue and develop my skills. In terms of the theme 'Keep It Alive', I wanted to implement a system where the player has to decide whether to pick up a special object or place it on the ground. The objective is to carry/escort this object to the end of the level. However, if the player is carrying it they are encumbered and cannot attack, all the while more enemies spawn and attack the player and the object. I just ran out of time :-)</p>\n<p>Tech:<br/>Code: Mostly by James Doyle here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2dplatformer/ and Brackeys https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA.<br/>Unity Asset Store \u2013 Ferr2D, Pixel Hero Warrior 16x16<br/>Art - https://luizmelo.itch.io/<br/>Audio - Freesound.org<br/>DAW - Nuendo4<br/>Dafont</p>\n<p>Known Issues/Bugs:<br/>The player sprite scale seems to flip/break after respawning, in some cases.<br/>Lives counter UI is wrong when Game Over.<br/>Player can jump up continuously up vertical ground if close enough.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:50:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08a/08a3057382b6dfa2ab76b8d182a3af42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sherwinkc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
