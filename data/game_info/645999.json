It's also probably the most complex thing I've ever coded.<br/>(BTW, If you make anything with the level editor or find a crash in it, I'd love to know. Contact me using my Discord (Skirlez#5521) or Twitter (@skirlez3)).<br/><br/>As you could probably tell by the last level, I mostly rushed it at the end. I really just wanted to get the game out so I can move on, because I feared that I could just procrastinate forever.<br/><br/>I hope you have fun.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaa/aaa3307ff3c535c7c6fbb535c2ed71c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skirlez"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
