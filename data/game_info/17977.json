{"id": 17977, "slug": "spirits", "name": "Spirits", "name_original": "Spirits", "description": "<p>Spirits is an indie adventure platformer developed by Spaces of Play. The game is heavily inspired by Lemmings.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Autumn is coming, the leaves become yellow and fall off the trees. The spirits of the fallen leaves go on their journey home.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players have to guide a group of fallen leaves spirits to a better place. The spirits can be commanded through changing the direction of the wind or building new paths. </p>\n<p>It is possible to sacrifice the leaf spirits to build a bridge out of leaves, make a wind-blowing cloud, dig out tunnels, and block the winds. The players have to use that feature carefully as using all of the leaves will result in a player&#39;s defeat and the further restart of the level. It is up to you to find your own creative way of completing a level and get the leaf spirits to an exit off the level.</p>\n<p>The game is specifically designed in a way that the determination and working out of your plan is much more harder than the plan&#39;s execution itself. There is a lot of moves that the spirits can execute, but are not as obvious as the players think they are. It is a process of trial and error for the players. </p>\n<p>The developers put a heavy emphasis on the relaxing aspect of the game, as its color palette features mostly warm colors such as orange, red, and yellow and its soundtrack was specifically made a little bit silent to not distract the players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a71f3dc234728188f8f1fd248877e55d.jpg", "website": "http://spacesofplay.com/spirits/", "rating": 2.77, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 65, "owned": 908, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 39, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "Linux", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Spaces of Play UG", "Spaces of Play"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mattias Ljungstrom", "Spaces of Play", "Spaces of Play UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
