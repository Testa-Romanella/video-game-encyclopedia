Now the bubble must protect the unaware Oliver before he meets an unsuspecting end\u00a0from a hoard of oranges lemons and limes!</p>\n\n\r\nThese foes fly through the sky on a straight path, hoping to hit Oliver in the process.\r\n\r\nThey dash towards Oliver and home on his location, but if they come in contact with the bubble, they will disappear.\r\n\r\nThey may seem friendly and don't try to target Oliver at first, but if he gets too close, all of the limes nearby will go into a rage, and run towards him until he  either gets away from them, or at least one of them hits him.\r\n<p>Made as an entry for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam.</p><p>Coding by Miles Boyer and Sebastian Boyer.</p><p>Art by Sam Zimmerman.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a1c5432b7753f7f1d5afceebb6346d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[*Insert Game]"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
