Fade's final level has been complete and can be unlocked by beating the first four! I hope you enjoy it, I put a lot of hard work into this project. I also did some minor buffs on certain enemies. The game may still have some bugs so I'm going to leave as \"in development\" for a little until I iron out all the rough edges. I hope you enjoy though! o3o</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26f/26f738d75653d433e3b619ba4f708511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["StardustLegend"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
