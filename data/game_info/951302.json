In that hour, the player is able to read his texts, see his image gallery, and complain about their coffee. Based on the chaotic moments of our lives. How fleeting they are, how confusing but in some way they can be beautiful in their own way.<br/></p><p>BTW, it's PG-13:\u00a0\u00a0While most of the game is okay, there are parts with sexual references, mentions of family problems, grief, loss, anxiety and inebriation. Also this game is made to be\u00a0 slightly unsettling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[NaNoReNo 2023\u00a0 Experience]\u00a0 I utilized this game jam to learn about RenPy, really dig into the docs. So I got to know about screens, functions, RNG, UI and ATL.... and got a little bit carried away.\u00a0But with so little time, I couldn't make all the content to inhabit those empty UI... I realized this while making the 'chat' area. It's very noticeable, how I 'stopped' progress there. I wanted to shred the project then but felt like effort wasted, a whole week scrapped. So I decided to 'finish' it despite it being still raw at the center. Still, this was a learning experience. If there's insights I could take from this, it's to slow down, take things simple, and PLAN. But still, I hope you enjoy what's set up, so far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[CREDITS]</p>\n<p>#\u00a0 Made with RenPy</p>\n<p>Images: Unsplash and Canva edited with Canva filters/stickers</p>\n<p>Sprite: Charat.me Bigbang https://charat.me/boys/create/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rigged with Live2d</p>\n<p># Fonts:</p>\n<p>- Arcane Nine Font https://www.fontspace.com/arcane-nine-font-f70997</p>\n<p>- Jupiteroid from ggbot.itch.io</p>\n<p># Music:</p>\n<p>-Edo Beats composed by \u30e0\u30e9\u30b7\u30de \u30c8\u30b7\u30ce\u30ea https://dova-s.jp/EN/bgm/play786.html</p>\n<p>- \u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30bc\u30ed composed by \u304b\u305a\u3061 https://dova-s.jp/EN/bgm/play1107.html</p>\n<p>- EDM composed by Y8MD https://dova-s.jp/EN/bgm/play1142.html</p>\n<p>- DRIVE BEAT composed by \u304b\u305a\u3061 https://dova-s.jp/EN/bgm/play856.html</p>\n<p>- \u30d3\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3 composed by \u304b\u305a\u3061 https://dova-s.jp/EN/bgm/play828.html</p>\n<p># GUI Assets</p>\n<p>Retro Windows GUI by comp3interactive https://comp3interactive.sitch.io/retro-windows-gui</p>\n<p>Phone ui for the chat https://nighten.itch.io/yet-another-phone-renpy</p>\n<p># Great Help:</p>\n<p>Phone NVL Mode: https://nighten.itch.io/yet-another-phone-renpy\u00a0</p>\n<p>Electric Zine Maker from alienmelon.itch.io (Edited some gallery pictures with it)</p>\n<p>For some of the fake tweets. https://www.tweetgen.com/</p>\n<p>https://lingojam.com for the cryptic text</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!
