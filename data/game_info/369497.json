I\u00a0think I learned a lot from this assignment, especially for the reference and dependency.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By using reference, I can\u00a0pull additional libraries into my project. And I learned that only when you need linkers then\u00a0you need to add reference. And it's not a good habit to add unnecessary dependencies, like MyGame project should not add dependency to BuildMyGameAssets\u00a0.</p>\n<p>And by using property sheet, we can create a custom group of settings for projects. This can help us manage our projects, like share with others or reuse in multiple projects.</p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0 Questions</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1) Tell us which projects needed to add a reference to the new Graphics project. (</strong><strong>Did you find any projects whose code mentioned the Graphics namespace, but didn't need a reference added? If so, give an example, and explain why the code in question doesn't require a reference.)</strong></p>\n<p>I find that Application project need to add a reference to Graphics project. And I find that ShaderBulid project mentioned the Graphics namespace, but didn't need a reference added.\u00a0 Because in the ShaderBuild project, there is no actual function from Graphics CPP files has been called.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Discuss briefly your expectations of the class based on the first lecture and what you know so far, and tell us what you hope to learn from it (When writing about what you hope to learn you shouldn't just tell John-Paul what you think he wants to read; instead, take some time and think about what you personally might be able to get out of the class that aligns with your interests.)</strong></p>\n<p>I hope I can learn a lot about how to design the code structure and\u00a0have a better understanding about how to make efficient and clean codes.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Others</strong></p>\n<p>1)\u00a0 I was confused about\u00a0why I need to change\u00a0working directory, and had struggled to fix thise error for a long time. After the class I had a clear understanding about why we need to change it to GameInstallDir. And I learned about the relative path and absolute path, this really helped me understand why this error wound happen.</p>\n<p>2) \u00a0I received help from Byreave and Pluto about some setting problems. I really appreciate about their help.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13b/13bb0919419acdd19f7bb55bd1cf2cb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zzzemma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
