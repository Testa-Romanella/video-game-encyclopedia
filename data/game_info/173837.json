The Ai throws a bunch of casts, if was the first time I was using them and I love them! The Ai has a detect ray which has a preset range which represents his sight, however, if the player steps into a camera detection area, the Ai can see him from afar.</p><p>* Please note that this simple prototype was inspired by Grand Theft Auto the original game. The sprites are from the game Hotline Miami/are a copy of the original art. This prototype is for personal use only.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad6a19f211ec87d97f2e8e052d5ca498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alxnstv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
