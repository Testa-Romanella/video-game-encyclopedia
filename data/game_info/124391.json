The game is very much unfinished though it is playable.</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys to move.</p>\n<p>Space to Jump.</p>\n<p>Controller should work too but untested.<br/></p>\n<p>Press R to reset the level if you die or get stuck.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in trying the game, download the files ending in fixedRes.

Just keep jumping right and you shooould get out of it.<br/></p>\n<p>Things I'd like to finish/improve:<br/>Better controls. They're a bit floaty and sticky at the same time.</p>\n<p>Actual level/world design - currently random objects and blocks of space cheese.</p>\n<p>Proper sound design<br/></p>\n<p>That said I think the core concept works and I'd quite like to develop this project further.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569083652f3b85bf8ad2bf5f1a579d30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["drentsoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
