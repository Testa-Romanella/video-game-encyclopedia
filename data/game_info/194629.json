If there are too many twins on screen for you to handle, you can \"detach\" some. Detached twins cannot be controlled and experience vertical gravity. However, if a detached twin collects a pellet, it's worth twice the points!</p>\n<p>Self cloning makes it easier to get past compound obstacles. These are multiple dots that appear red until you pass them (then they turn green). You must touch all component obstacles before any of them leave the stage or you lose the game.</p>\n<p>Compound obstacles in more detail</p>\n<p>In the game, you have pellets to collect and walls to avoid. However, component obstacles also spawn. These are the same size and shape as pellets but appear red until you pass (run into) them. Then they turn green. Collectively, these component obstacles are referred to as \"compound obstacles.\" These are the most challenging obstacles in the game.</p>\n<p>In order to overcome compound obstacles, you must pass all the component obstacles before any leave the stage i.e. go offscreen. Take care not to lose track of your twins while trying to hit the component obstacles, as if they run into an obstacle, you lose the game.</p>\n<p>HUD</p>\n<p>The UI shows you your current score, your high score, and the number of component obstacles currently in existence.</p>\n<p>Objective</p>\n<p>Avoid the obstalcles and collect as many pellets as possible. Touching the top and bottom walls is allowed. Make copies of yourself to overcome certain obstacles or to collect more pellets.</p>\n<p>You earn more points if the pellet is earned by a detached twin.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Press W and S to move up and down.
