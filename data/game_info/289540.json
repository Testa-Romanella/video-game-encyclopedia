Then this game should be relatable to you! Your goal is to run home before you've spent all your CSN. Along the road you run into a bunch of crap (drinks, games, junk food etc)\u00a0that you should avoid purchasing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you approach a piece of crap, a sequence of keys will get displayed. Type the keys in the correct order before your temptation gets you! But be careful, because if you enter the wrong key you simply can't help but to buy what's in front of you! I guess you could say that \"IT'S\u00a0A\u00a0<strong>CRAP</strong>\"\u00a0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING!!!
