{"id": 522339, "slug": "silent-reflections", "name": "Silent Reflections", "name_original": "Silent Reflections", "description": "<p>This is a prototype demo for my upcoming game, \"Silent Reflections\".<br/></p>\n\n<p>Silent Reflections is a twisted, Zelda-like game that takes place in a dark, \"Alice in Wonderland-esque\" fantasy world. Instead of starting in the overworld, the game starts right in the first dungeon, which is one of the deepest and darkest of them all. Through the first act of the game, you will work your way through these dungeons, finding unique treasures and earning more freedom along the way.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of treasures, this game will not have any one-off \"key items\". Each major item is designed to be a \"multi-tool\" which can be used in several settings and is useful outside of the dungeon you find it in. This also means that the bosses at the end of each dungeon can be beaten in multiple ways, which breaks the mold of \"shoot the weak spot three times and win\".\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Furthermore, this game will not have \"junk\" treasure chests (you will no longer feel the disappointment of only finding five rupees in a chest that you went out of your way for). Although you will have to work harder for them, every treasure chest you find will feel like real\u00a0treasure and contain something that's actually useful.</p>\n\n<p>The prototype is a proof of concept that shows off some of the design and mechanics that may be in the final game. Keep in mind that nothing\u00a0in the prototype is final and is subject to change in the final version of the game. Furthermore, you should expect few bugs and some jank since it is just a prototype.</p>\n\n<p>With where the game is at in its current state, I will not be able to complete it. However, with your support,\u00a0 I'll be able to rebuild the systems in the game for future use, which will make the game much easier to create in the long run. Furthermore, I will improve the art and sound design so I can create a proper demo with a crisp, modern feel.\u00a0 All in all, your support will allow this game to come to life.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for your help. I could never make this dream come true without your generosity, and I appreciate that you went out of your way to help me.
