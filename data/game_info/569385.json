There are common and uncommon cats, and sometimes you might even find a super rare kitty with heterochromia.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>There is no point to this game. At least not yet. Just go in an have fun playing with huge piles of limp kittens.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>There are currently no plans for any further development. I may come back to this some day and expand upon its foundation, however at this time there are bigger and more important projects taking my time, so this release is both the first and the last for the foreseeable future.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Currently available for Windows and Linux. It was made primarily for Linux, tested to work fine on Windows. No Mac version sadly, maybe some day.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T05:35:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b32ff3296c1cc9017f7547194e6edcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kochich"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
