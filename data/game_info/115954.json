{"id": 115954, "slug": "winter-windows", "name": "Winter Windows", "name_original": "Winter Windows", "description": "<p>Winter Windows is a fast-paced arcade game where you navigate a maze of ladders and corridors, rallying to close and lock all the windows before the evil snowmen chase you down... or your house gets so cold you freeze right on the spot! As you proceed, the levels get trickier and tricker and a larger group of snowmen will try to surround you! Take part in fierce competition for the top of the highscore table!</p>\n<p>Everything is presented in authentic quality 8-bit sprites and sounds, giving you a perfect 1980s arcade feeling. Originally created for the 16x16 Challenge with the theme \"Keep Warm\".</p>\n<p>Protips:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold a diagonal direction to get off a ladder faster. Useful if you're being chased.</li><li>You can grab the padlock while it's falling, even if you're on a higher level than it will land on.</li><li>Snowmen will always head for a closed window before they chase you down. Closing an open window at the right time can let you escape out of some tight spots.</li><li>Temperature falls faster the more windows are open. If it hits zero, you will get frozen immediately even if there's no snowmen around.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bb/2bbdbe07c3b51f61e7359e2277253224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
