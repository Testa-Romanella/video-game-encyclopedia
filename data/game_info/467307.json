Wait for it to refill to use again.</p>\n<p>Each side of your character has 2 bars. The taller one (blue/cyan) is the stamina for the movement in that direction, and the wider one (yellow) is the stamina for the shot int that direction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commands</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use <em>WASD </em>to move and <em>ARROW KEYS</em> to shoot.
