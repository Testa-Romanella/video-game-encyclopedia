All you have to do is enter the details of each turn.<br/><br/>If you don\u2019t want to give your opponents a chance Clued Up can go beyond just a smart scorecard. If you enable automatic deductions the app will cross-reference all of the turns in the game and locate cards for you, going way beyond what a human-being could achieve.<br/><br/>Clued Up Pro works with any edition of Clue. Out of the box, it has support for the \u2018Classic\u2019 and the new \u2018Discover the Secrets\u2019 editions and many more. If you don\u2019t see your edition listed you can use the card set editing feature to create any edition you like and store it in the cloud for others to use.<br/><br/>Any feedback you can provide will be very much appreciated for future updates.<br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter for the latest promotions, news and updates. @MarkBridgesApps<br/><br/>Instructions<br/>Game Setup:<br/><br/>Enter your name then the names of your opponents in the order they are sitting, starting with the player on your left.<br/><br/>Select if you want the game to automatically locate cards for you. If you select to use this feature, as you record the turns in the game the app will cross-reference the location of cards from all of the player's responses and deduce for you what cards must have been shown in each go. Be sure that your opponents don\u2019t mind you winning if you leave this switch on (or don\u2019t tell them).<br/><br/>Once you\u2019ve entered the names of the players in the game you\u2019ll be given the option to select which edition of the game you are playing. If you don\u2019t see your edition listed then you can create a new edition.

You will also see stats indicating how likely each card is to be the final item as a percentage and with the progress bar under each card.<br/><br/>To eliminate items you need to make suggestions and enter in the suggestions that your opponents make. The app will automatically eliminate a card if it is shown to you and, if you\u2019ve selected to have the game located cards for your, when entering another player\u2019s suggestion, if a card is shown and it\u2019s known that the other two cards in the suggestion are elsewhere or not held by that player the game will automatically eliminate these.<br/><br/>To enter your suggestion you pick the items from the table and press the \u2018Your Suggestion\u2019 button.
