Name of the game? Make it to the end, collect the gems, and show off to your friends your epic platforming skills, at least, without raging. Discover three hand-built worlds while roaming your way through the levels. You may take it slow, or speedrun it as fast as humanly possible, or spam powerups at the cost of all your coins. The choice is all yours. Oh - and try not to die too much, please?<br/><br/><br/>Discover hand-built environments and worlds through your journey!<br/><br/>I have spent a total of 8 months making this game. For everyone here, for everyone who has supported me,<strong> thank you so much! And have fun!</strong><br/>--WraithWinterly", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T03:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c06b1a41c6f7df5e25c0afcadeb28e9.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/everplast", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WraithWinterly"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["WraithWinterly"], "esrb_rating": null}
