Four trolls enjoyed each others company by the campfire in the Norwegian woods. The moonlight shine upon them as the only natural light source they could withstand. As you might know, trolls turn to stone if exposed to sunlight. Speaking of which, the sun could be seen in the horizon. Fear filled the trolls and they fled to the nearest cave. Barely reaching it in time they stumbled upon a treasure. Gold and silver filled the floor with shiny objects, but there was one object in particular that got the trolls attention. A mysterious bottle had been carefully placed on a pedestal. What could this be.? Curiosity filled the room as they gave it a closer look. Written on the front of the bottle, it read \"Sunblock\". Sunblock factor 1000 to be exact. With such a high resistance to UV light, one should believe a troll would be able to travel anywhere during the day. And that's exactly what they figured. There was only one problem... the bottle wasn't big enough for them all.<br/><p>Project Troll is a 2-4 local multiplayer game designed for fun and exciting evenings with your friends.
