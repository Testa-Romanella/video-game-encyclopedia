A wizard wakes up from a hangover and needs to undo the summoning ritual he did while drunk. His magic talking wizard hat helps him close the portal to hell.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a point and click adventure game where puzzles are randomly generated on each restart. To help play the game there is two paper manuals; Wizardry 101 and a Futhark to Latin lexicon. There is also a tiny crocheted wizard hat prop the wizard-player should wear.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The theme for Global Game Jam 2016 was \u201cRitual\u201d. From this we brainstormed forth a game idea where the played had to be guided by another player holding a demonic encyclopedia, containing information about the demons in the world. This later grew into The Epic Hangover of the Wizard. We used a couple of Diversifiers for this game.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>No retreat, no surrender!\r\n</strong>The protagonist is unable to go anywhere but forward, in every situation.</li><li><strong>One hand tied behind my back</strong>\r\nCreate a game that can be played with only one hand.
