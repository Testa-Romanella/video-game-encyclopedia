This particular build allows the player to descend and fully experience 5 of the 10 dungeon levels that exist in the game. I believe It should offer enough of a gameplay experience for everyone who decides to download it and play.</p>\n<p>Due to the fact that I'll be running a kickstarter campaign to make a much more advanced version of the Jewel of the Five Suns for the Sega Megadrive console, a compressed ROM file showing the preliminary graphical and audio expected state of the game should the project get 33% of its stretch goals funded is included in the game's directory.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>If by any chance you enjoyed this version of the game, by kind enough to leave a comment. It always helps us game creators to know that our efforts give joy and satisfaction to players out there.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T06:53:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/463830dc2b69fd7fc54e81940e7617e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["althael27"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
