The story is that as a knight you leave your home to go on a quest for treasure and fame. You make your way towards the nearest dungeon and explore multiple levels including a sunny, bright forest, the entrance of the dungeon, and then finally the deepest part of the dungeon where he will hopefully survive and take home his reward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Play Goal: Advancement and Completion: Multiple levels with different completion goals. Level one is more of an introduction to the game so the goal is simply for the player to reach the end of the level while avoiding or attacking enemies. Level 2 involves a lot of platforming and timing jumps properly and level 3 involves surviving hordes of enemies for as long as you can. The goal of the player is to complete all three of these unique challenges without losing all of their lives in the process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Workload: We used some scripts and prefabs from the previous 2D Platformer game to simplify the game building process along with a few opensource assets from the unity asset store from the following asset packs: Pixel Monster Pack - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-monster-pack-75508 Medieval Pixel Art Asset FREE - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/medieval-pixel-art-asset-free-130131#description Sunny Land - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349#content Free Pixel Food - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-pixel-food-113523#description Hero Knight - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/hero-knight-pixel-art-165188#description\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contributions:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Justin Chorazyczewski: Designed 1st level Set up the 2D platformer managers and systems for the game Worked on enemies and their movement behaviors\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucas Jordan: Designed the second level Created player object and animator based on prefabs both from class and included in the player art assets we used.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Logan Borrero Designed third level Changed pickup prefabs with new sprites Made music from garageband Created rule tiles for background, foreground Made scripts for camera movement, enemy spawner, and UI survival timer</p>\n<p>*Download attached video file for demo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/087/087967310b81039299aba5ad9d85098b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ljborrero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
