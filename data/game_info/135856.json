I have vague plans to add other kinds of kids, like a Virtual Pet Kid and a Media Hipster Kid. I also have plans to make POGs more collectible, and to give Slammers unique, special powers - some of which can be used in field. Oh also it would be nice if the Mall actually looked like a Mall with storefronts, counters, cashiers, merchandise, and decor. Ha ha, oh well!</p>\n<p>In the mean time, enjoy this retro POG simulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27fd67806d1536ebacfe8518624f21d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jamstone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
