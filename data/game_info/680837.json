Then extend the word by also clicking on other bricks.</p>\n<p>You can click on a word that is blue or gold to score it. Mistakes cause you to start building a new word, but you will still get credit for what you were building, if it itself was a word.</p>\n<p>Use both the top and the bottom of the screen to build two words at the same time! Hold S and click on bricks to send them to the bottom! Use this to your advantage to build as many words as you can in two minutes!</p><p>Coming soon to Android &amp; iOS!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T06:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f013748aaa0225d04d992bc8a26ac60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SKYLE"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
