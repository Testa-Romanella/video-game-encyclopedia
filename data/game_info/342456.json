The rest of the game is just a vehicle for those explosions. There are elements of a roguelike in the pathing and movement of the main character. This is the first game jam where I created nearly all the pixelart tile pieces used in the game. The art took a day and some change.\u00a0The rest of the technical implementation was done over 2 days.</p>\n<p><strong>What Made It</strong>: Text events along the path, multiple endings (9 in total), tile floor variations, destructible obstacles, basic light-on-tilemap action, EXPLOOOSIONS.</p>\n<p><strong>What Didn't Make It</strong>: 3 endings related to monsters, monsters, light-based monster-fighting dynamic, deeper cave levels and puzzles, forest level.</p>\n<p><strong>What I Learned:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Flexibility vs maintainability.\u00a0Instead of over-engineering a proper set of scripts, I went hog wild making scripts and game objects that fit the bill in Unity. Results? Yes. Maintainability? Ohh ho ho no.</li><li>While I was able to flex some creative pixel muscle, it was required of me at some point during the dev cycle to find free art assets for the explosion and characters, Thomas and Claudia. See credits below for sources.</li><li>Sleep is still important. As much as caffeine.</li><li>Sound added so much depth, and was expected. Getting sound to fire for the first time means I will put it at higher priority. Looking at you next, music.</li><li>Becoming more solid in Pixel Perfect Unity layouts. What was once a few hour chore was complete in 20 minutes.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Anthony Gross</strong><br/>Font - \"Hello World\"<br/>Public domain, GPL, OFL</p>\n<p><strong>Ansimuz </strong>-\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io<br/>Explosion animations pack -\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/explosion-animations-pack<br/>Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal<br/>Tiny RPG Town -\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/tiny-rpg-town\u00a0<br/>Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal\u00a0<br/><br/>Please leave feedback or issues in comments below, or hit me up on Discord.
