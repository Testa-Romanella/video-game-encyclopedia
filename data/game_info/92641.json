Use a melee weapon or firearms to fight monsters, read documents and examine the area around you to learn about the game's cryptic backstory, and find keys and items that enable you to progress deeper into the abyss. </p><p>The sequel <strong>Overlooker 2</strong> is out now! <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><strong>Overlooker</strong> is my first game and was completed in under 22 days. My main goal has been to keep the game as minimal as possible and learn as much as I can about game development. I am looking for as much constructive criticism and as many comments as possible about the game so that I can improve for my next game, so feel free to e-mail me at connorortlinning@gmail.com!<br/></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You can buy the soundtrack below, or buy it from my Bandcamp page! https://connorortlinning.bandcamp.com/ </p><p>Follow my pages and social media for more updates!<br/>Website: http://www.connorlinning.com<br/>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/connorortlinning<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/ConnorORT<br/>Tumblr: http://connorort.tumblr.com/<br/>Bandcamp: https://connorortlinning.bandcamp.com</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I support and appreciate filesharing of Overlooker and happily give permission to Let's Players to use ads and monetize their videos.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e527c8aa1899681151fb105a49e4467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ConnorORT"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
