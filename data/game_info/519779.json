The algorythm used for modelling the terrain is marching cubes, with a linear interpolation. It is running on the GPU as a compute shader.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Requirements:</strong>\n<p>No, It won't run smoothly on a potato.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:03:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d040505284ea64be758f39ec04620102.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kubatomsu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
