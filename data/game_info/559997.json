A Scientist made the Simulator, and after years of Updating it, He got to Test it. It didn't really work as expected though, because there Were these Viruses that often appear, And theres no way to stop them! The Worms will Duplicate / Reproduce when they Eat food with another worm. You can undo Your Movements, Control the timescale from 0.5x - 2x, and Kill viruses with your Mighty Mouse!, becareful with your choices though, 2x with a virus On your Simulation will most Likely\u00a0Kill the Army and crash Your simulation. You either Go Big or go home! (Made for the 2021.1 Brackeys Jam) :D -keep in mind this is my 1st jam game, have fun ;) }}</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb98d07f996567e8a391799ff99fc58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JowinAng"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
