It was the first step to coming out as something I<br/>found no name for then, sent to a mostly friendly stranger that would go on<br/>to become one of the most profound intimacies of my young adult life.</p>\n<p>Years later now during the global meltdown of 2020, I found myself like many others\u00a0looking back at the connections that made me, and the touches that are out of reach.\u00a0The following shifting form of mind game or poem is a sensuous conversation\u00a0between these two moments, an attempt to make something new of it, a\u00a0tribute to the touches that shape us and the loves we cannot name.<br/><br/>This game is largely made for myself. <br/>If, upon downloading and reading it,\u00a0it still speaks to you, please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff2af84b6203a9bd980c644e0659bef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alinac"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
