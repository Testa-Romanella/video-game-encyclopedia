{"id": 501412, "slug": "cave-age", "name": "Cave Age", "name_original": "Cave Age", "description": "<p>Cave Age is a side-scrolling platform game set in prehistoric times. You play as Dave, the caveman, as he journeys through a treacherous cave system. Dave can jump, climb walls, and throw spears at enemies. The goal is to reach the exit, gaining as many points as possible along the way, by killing enemies and collecting bones.</p>\n<p>Enemies are smart but predictable, if you keep your eye on them. Puzzles are relatively easy, but the enemies won\u2019t allow you to progress so easily. There are secret areas that may require backtracking for a chance to increase your total score. Players have a chance to submit a high score at the end.<br/><br/>Music by Kevin McLeod<br/><br/>Made in Gamemaker.
