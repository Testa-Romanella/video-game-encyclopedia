While a simple Mega Man styled platformer on the surface, the original game (Alex in High School 2), had tons of political themes, personal bias, and the insertion of real life people who I was at odds with. How on earth could I redeem such an infamous piece of AL Games' history?</p>\n<p><em>Simply removing all the offensive stuff, that's what.</em></p>\n<p>The plot involves a teenage boy, assumed to be a stereotypical \"nice guy\" trying to court a girl he met on the bus. Now her boyfriend is mad and has sent his buddies to kill the player. Unbeknownst to them, this boy is armed with an orange laser gun... and probably shouldn't be in the first place.</p>\n<p>I guess you could call this the grandfather of\u00a0Senioritis, as it has a similar setting and plot. You should really go play that instead if you want something of quality.</p>\n<p>(Note: Alex in High School 2 was fully released in May 2014, but 90% of the game's content was made in 2013 and was a public demo, which is why I set the date to November 2013.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c4/3c4a298c65189f9889f00616a7c72b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["algamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
