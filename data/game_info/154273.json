I'm not a student at Brisbane, but I wanted to keep the creative juices flowing after finishing my own college's jam. I'd also like to apologize for submitting an extraordinarily bare-bones entry. I had more plans for it, but now I'll just have to settle for updates and submit what I have. Hope I wasted nobody's time.</p>\n<p>Just click to \"thwart\" little \"blips\" on the radar, or it's game over.</p>\n<p>UPDATED: Noticed that the game jam was still on (my mistake), so I'm adding some of the things that I think at least improve it a bit (but not by much). A title screen, stock sound effects, a reticle, and screen-shake, just to see if I could do it. Hope it's improved, and again, sorry for entering a game jam from a school I don't attend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a46/a46b2b825f62af0fc1b70d352158433a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LittleFieryOne"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
