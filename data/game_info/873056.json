We are beings who can't be harmed by these paranormal creatures, however these poor mortals are being hunted down by them. It's up to you to dispose of any evidence of this creature. This means cleaning any mess they leave behind, removing the entities and if it comes down to it remove any dead bodies that they leave behind. We'll make sure to dispose them in a safely contained space. In the event anyone does see what happened then use your special device and wipe their mind, they'll be none the wiser and forget what happened. Best of luck, you're their only hope.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>wasd/arrows - movement</li><li>spacebar - clean ectoplasm</li><li>left click/enter - capture ghost</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e15/e152a5eaf3813453419956cccc232cff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PaRK66", "ONiex", "KaenGhost", "ayame1212"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
