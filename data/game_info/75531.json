Your task is to restrain the pressure of the army of enemy tanks within a given time. The player has anti-tank guns at his disposal. You move around the battlefield in the top view and can select any cannon by clicking on it. After that, you switch to first-person shooting mode and can attack enemy tanks. After shooting, you switch back to the general view of the battlefield. For each downed tank you get points. For every 100 points scored, one opportunity is added to summon aircraft to bombard a section of the battlefield. If, after the time of this level, the tanks could not reach the lower boundary of the battlefield, the level is considered passed. If enemy tanks have reached the lower boundary of the battlefield, then the level is considered not passed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T02:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/39174096054cc97544aaeb168286ea7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Sivatsky", "Aleksey"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Alexander Sivatsky", "AlekseyN"], "esrb_rating": null}
