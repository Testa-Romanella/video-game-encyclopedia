This game contains only two levels which means that this game was developed as a demo. The purpose of having this game as a demo, is to showcase my core mechanics as a preview of the final game. The goal of this game is to start off with the training in the headquarters and reach to the final level to defeat 'Farkas' which the name of the boss enemy to win the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u00a0is set in space and 'Farkas' is trying to destroy planet earth by causing an atomic bomb. To launch the missiles, 'Farkas' must enter the code which he has not got. For him to get the code, he would send his robot enemies to invade the headquarters and steal the code. It is easy for the robot enemies to invade and retrieve the code, so the headquarters are looking for someone who is talented and be able to help. The player is from planet earth, and he received a message and was told that he was chosen to travel to the headquarters in space and help them to fight the enemies from destroying planet earth. The player was chosen because he is so talented in fencing and other extreme sports. The goal is to fight 'Farkas' and capture him after being targeted for so many years.</p>\n\n\n<p>Input Controls:</p>\n\n<p>WSAD = Move</p>\n<p>Space Bar = Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse Input Sensitivity = Look Around</p>\n<p>Hold Left Mouse Button = 3 Combo Attacks</p>\n<p>P = Pause Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71b/71b92ce7c62d8fc4cadec1f6288c390a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DawoodAmir7"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
