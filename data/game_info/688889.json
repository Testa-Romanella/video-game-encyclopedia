Your primary task is to capture \"drop zones\" with your shuttles and commandos. You rely on stealth, agility and speed, rather than on firepower. <br/><br/><strong>Game mechanics and features</strong><br/>The mechanics are described in their best details on the official game website, but here are some of the most distinguished:<br/>- the ships feel like in real space - no gravity, inertia<br/>- planets have atmosphere - ship might get damaged by it<br/>- full 3d movement freedom<br/>- patience, some tactical thinking and battlefield observation is needed<br/>- automatic weaponry, countermeasures<br/>- armor and shield for most of the ships<br/>- ship subsystems, repairs <br/>- story progression, described in briefings before every mission<br/>- briefing hints and in-game tooltips to act as tutorial and help the player<br/>- friendly, neutral, enemy ships<br/>- small random events<br/><br/><br/><strong>Ship/inventory management</strong><br/>There is a basic inventory management with option to replenish it at certain conditions - when approaching space station or calling for support. The ship uses fuel and life-support items.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Overall feeling</strong><br/>Inspired by \"The Expanse\" series, the set is (trying) staying \"close-to-real-world\" physics and limitations, where space is vast, empty and dangerous, the humans are vulnerable, sustained entirely by their craft. The technological level, with small exceptions, is close to our near-future one. The short background story can be found on \"the set\" subpage on the website.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Game Length:</strong><br/>The game is about 2-10 hours long, includes 6 single-player missions. The difficulty level is moderate.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Creation</strong><br/>This is an independent, non-commercial, non-profit project, driven by the pure passion for games, the curiosity how they are made and function, the admiration of the ingenuity it takes to create one, the huge challenge and a long-lasting dream. The game is created in the span of 10 months - from January 2021 to October 2021, by a single man with no experience in the field whatsoever.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T04:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/704/704dd167589af532c604097ff5cc18f8.jpg", "website": "https://planetdrop.nobfg.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ukio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ukio"], "esrb_rating": null}
