The game mainly centers around its wave-based horde-mode experience, sound design in the style of classic arcade games and split screen multiplayer. Additionally, the arena features elements of procedural-generation; meaning that every play-through takes place in a new arena. How long will you last?</p>\n<p> <br/> </p>\n<p>Pulseless features 50 unique weapons; all with their own special quirks and gimmicks. Some fire incendiary rounds, setting enemies ablaze; whilst others fire toxic sludge, causing enemies to become more vulnerable to damage.</p>\n<p>Each weapon has their own, sometimes weird, niche; and its up to you to find out how to make the best use of them.</p>\n<p> <br/> </p>\n<p>Pulseless also features a variety of enemy types, each providing a unique challenge when introduced into your run. There are enemies like the 'Pacer'; that runs ahead of the horde; shattering any bullets before they can harm the others.</p>\n<p>Each enemy, although providing a challenge, has its own weaknesses and counter-strategies; and its your job to figure them out.</p>\n<p> <br/> </p>\n<p>Ever wanted to drag a friend into the fray? Well now you can!.. kind of.</p>\n<p>Pulseless also features full split-screen support for up to 2 players, allowing you to drag some poor lucky soul into the action with you.</p>\n<p> <br/> </p>\n<p>Lastly, the game also features two alternate control schemes: an arcade inspired scheme and a generic top-down shooter scheme. These are only available when playing single-player.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, feel free to give Pulseless a play!</p>\n<p>#arcade #multiplayer #shooter #action #survival #retro #other #hordemode #topdown #arcadeshooter #shooter\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T07:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f55229b9e09363b18857c88d500ae618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Late Night Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
