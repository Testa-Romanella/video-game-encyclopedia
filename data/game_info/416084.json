Running out of food wasn't in his plans but he needs to make sure his babies are fed. As he get near home he realizes something seems wrong and he hears faint shrieks in the distance.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is a whimsical game made more amusing by the random story I am attaching to it. This is a game about survival and desperation as the player should feel worry for their children and a desire to protect their own from those that would hurt them. However, you\u2019re a tiny\u00a0crab against a rather large\u00a0bird, so killing it is out of the question. Survive and reach your family.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/8906c315bf311e66f1882656b7036dbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToastieRuin", "sethruiz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
