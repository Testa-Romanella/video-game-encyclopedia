Combine the attack button with a single directional input to perform combo attacks; button combos will perform different attacks if performed after other attacks, during a dodge, or in the air vs on the ground. Charge your energy to release a ranged blast on your next combo.<br/><br/>I hilariously expected to make an actual fighting game but quickly came back to reality and realized that I had massively over-scoped. Instead of simplifying, I leaned into it and decided to just do a simple fighting engine and make it look/feel as best as I could given the time constraints. Happy with how it turned out, but I have no plans as of now to take it anywhere. That could change, though.
