The main secret is Owen himself: it is not just a clever technique, but a whole computer ecosystem that manages the complex of test chambers.<br/>Leo's task in this labyrinth is unequivocal: to pass all the trials, save himself and be home again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32dfa4d5f7bf74416ee192a9d2e25a1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eugene Makashov"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dagestan Technology"], "esrb_rating": null}
