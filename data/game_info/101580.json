{"id": 101580, "slug": "bunky", "name": "BUNKY", "name_original": "BUNKY", "description": "<p>Story: You escaped... But for how long? Probably forever you thought, but no, after escaping TUNKY's House of Horror, you immediately ran into his brother, BUNKY. Now he's captured you to play a game of \"Hunt the Human.\" Will you be able to escape BUNKY and his House of Horror? Good luck...</p>\n<p>So here comes the sequel to TUNKY. This time with new mechanics to help you survive, some improvements to existing ones and a few random events that can occur only once in each playthrough to make it sorta surprising each time you play. I tried to make this one pretty darn scary and I really hope I pulled it off. I'm not really good at making horror games to be honest, I'm better at making spooky/atmospheric games like Scooby Horror or 3 AM at The Krusty Krab. But I can always try to make scary games, right? I hope you enjoy this one.</p>\n<p>Wanna support me to make this a small side job?
