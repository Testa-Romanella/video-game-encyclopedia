I'll be checking it over in the coming days and possibly even adding more features.

I hope he's not upset about that.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03e/03e5e416e4d344be8720b4d8ce706e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chaoseed"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
