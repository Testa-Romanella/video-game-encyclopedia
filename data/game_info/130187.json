After reading and discussing this story many times, I was inspired by how many people failed to understand Connie as a character. Or missed the fact that, when two forces collide in such a way, like the wolf and Red Riding Hood, north and south poles, cold and warm fronts, the end, reaction, and storm are only inevitable. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I intend this game to be an exercise in empathy and inevitability, to be proof of the notion that where you've been defines where you're going, and to use this medium to emphasize the thematic elements of Joyce Carol Oates' story. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Choose thoughtfully. Remember where you've been.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a05028c64f79ae2115a7206e39035077.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maddiemery"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
