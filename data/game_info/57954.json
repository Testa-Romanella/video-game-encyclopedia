The game was released in 2000, and has been re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita consoles. Vagrant Story was primarily developed by the team responsible for Final Fantasy Tactics, with Yasumi Matsuno serving as producer, writer and director.<br />\nThe game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Le\u00e1 Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Le\u00e1 Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.<br />\nVagrant Story is unique as a console action-adventure role-playing game in that it features no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game received critical acclaim from gaming magazines and websites.</p>", "metacritic": 92, "released": "2000-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-03T17:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cdc/cdc039b06d3adddbf0499f72d6e59169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 54, "owned": 56, "beaten": 36, "toplay": 65, "dropped": 36, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 55, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Square", "Square Product Development Division 4"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Square"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
