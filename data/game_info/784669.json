It is kind of on hold now though since I'm busy now.</p>\n<p>I took a lot of liberty in it, only copying the mechanics. The design and story are completely different from the official demo.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy playing it.</p>\n<p>Current version: v0.1.15. Has\u00a01 boss, 2 secret health upgrades, and some enemies. Has Inventory, Journal, Map, and Save System.</p><p>There are some 3rd-party materials I used. Credits at the bottom of Github README.</p>\n<p>Support keyboard, Xbox and PS4. There are tutorials in the game.</p>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul><li>X - Jump.\r\n</li><li>Q - Silk skill\r\n</li><li>F - Parry\r\n</li><li>C - Attack\r\n</li><li>Z - Dash\r\n</li><li>V - Use tools\r\n</li><li>I - Open inventory\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Xbox</p>\n<ul><li>A - Jump\r\n</li><li>X - Attack\r\n</li><li>B - Silk skill\r\n</li><li>Y - Parry\r\n</li><li>RT - Dash\r\n</li><li>LB - Use tools\r\n</li><li>Start - Menu</li></ul>\n<p>Source code repo\u00a0here:\u00a0https://github.com/lamnguyenkhoa/SilkMelody</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:50:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f52f5be3aca2bbdf43cbf93d56e71f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohnMiner"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
