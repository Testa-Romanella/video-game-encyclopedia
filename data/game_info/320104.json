This game is a prototype made in two weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a two week prototype created by Bonnie Bolton, Tony Nguyen, Darwin Henderson, and Alexia Carmona. This project was created for a prototyping class at the University of Texas at Austin. As the theme was to craft as well as have an inventory, we wanted to go with a different type of crafting like cooking. We believed that the story of a grandma cooking for her grandchildren was a fun and comedic idea that everyone could enjoy.
