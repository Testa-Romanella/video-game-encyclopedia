Nowadays all the \"regular food\" is made to\u00a0be entirely absorbed by your body, so no nutrient\u00a0is wasted. That means the body no longer needs\u00a0to ... use the toilet to do the number 2.\u00a0But, however, in \"The Space b4 Space\" is served\u00a0OLD SCHOOL RETRO food. Therefore, even with\u00a0the extinction of toilets, THE LAST REMAINING\u00a0TOILET OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE is held in this\u00a0caffeteria. Nothing like taking a good shit to make\u00a0you feel alive again. But there is a problem! The\u00a0place is under attack. By the only race that's known\u00a0for breaking toilets after taking a dump. Yes, Jim. IT'S DEMONS. Let us call, then, the only warriors of the entire universe that are capable of seeing demons and fight them. The Cats. Our hope for the Last Remaining Toilet is in the hands of a HUNTERCAT named Bob, the best of it's kind. Save us, Bob. The fate of the toilet rests in your... paws.</p>\n<p>#IWantToCreate</p>\n<p>I\u00a0expected to deliver much more on this game, but I had one man down, so all the art had to be done by me.
