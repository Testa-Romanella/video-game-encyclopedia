What we have here is a little\u00a0prototype of a game but I like it anyway. It's been a great jam for me because I learned so many useful tricks that I am going to use in my future projects. :3</p>\n<p>My biggest regret is making 2/10 dialogues few hours before the deadline. This game could have been much more fun with an engaging story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a374b06e9b228cb2abd14c2c54caec6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kuma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
