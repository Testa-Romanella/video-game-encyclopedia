I used Palette 0 and for them i used \"History Repeats\" since the Waves of enemies are infinite and you will do a lot of the same most of the time!</strong></p>\n<p>I tried to merge the Idle game genre like Cookie Clicker or Clicker Heroes with the Tower Defense genre, and come up with this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>I think it best for you to play it casually like any idle game, since you will earn gold even if you close the game, so i encourage you to check the game out every now and then to see your progress.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Perfect to play while you test other CGAJAM games ;)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS/TIPS</strong></p>\n<p>-.To start playing, press SPACE or the play button in the WAVE panel. You can PAUSE the spawning by clicking the PAUSE button or by pressing SPACE again.</p>\n<p>-.You have to kill 10 Monsters from a WAVE to unlock the next WAVE.</p>\n<p>-.Kill monster by clicking on them. Once you earn enough gold, select a TOWER in the TOWERS panel and then buy towers by clicking on any place of the WALLS in the game area.</p>\n<p>-.In the TOWERS UPGRADES panel you can buy upgrades for your towers and UNLOCK NEW ONES.</p>\n<p>-.LEVEL 0 TOWERS ARE LOCKED, to unlock them just increase their level to at least 1.</p>\n<p>-.Monsters that reach the other side of the maze will hurt your total gold.</p>\n<p>-.YOU WILL EARN GOLD EVEN IF YOU CLOSE THE GAME.</p>\n<p>-.You can use the MOUSE WHEEL to go UP and DOWN waves.</p>\n<p>-.You can sell TOWERS by RIGHT CLICKING on them, you earn 50% of what you originally spent on them.</p>\n<p>-.See how far you can go...
