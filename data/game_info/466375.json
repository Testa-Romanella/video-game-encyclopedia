Instead the detective will go seemingly out of his way to misunderstand the simple\u00a0 facts of the case. In other words... it's out of your control.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7ec13ea7b6faccd15ed770502988b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DonutDuckProducktions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
