She asks her son to carry her up a mountain and leave her behind. <br/><br/>This story is reminiscent of the Ubasute, the mythical Japanese practice of taking an elderly relative to the top of a mountain and leaving them to die. <br/><br/>In this final journey, the player retraces the travel of Yunai and her son, in which Yunai shares her last words, beginning with her memories of a life that began with the weight of absence: that of a twin brother who died during her childhood. She opens up about how she would like to join her brother's soul in the afterlife.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game Art</strong><br/>Adam Aubart - Cyane Batsleer - Leyna Amies<br/><br/><strong>Game Design</strong><br/>Remi Logez - Arthur Hache</p>\n<p><strong>Game Programming</strong><br/>Matt\u00e9o Benaissa - Remy Masselot</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T08:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bf/3bf6cc0397d9bc7c59a7d5f655f561c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matteo Benaissa", "Soksahry", "RemiLogez", "RemyMasselot", "AdamAubart"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
