Still, the barebones of a project I would like to one day revisit exist there. The general concept is pretty cool, but the main point of this WIP was to experiment with a second-person, future tense narration form (which is honestly harder than I thought it would be), while also putting down some prototypical character designs and just introducing a narrative voice and getting familiar with putting down prose under the aforementioned guidelines.<br/>If I ever manage to pick this back up again, loads would be subject to change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:38:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1f73b707730aa53ac32492a4e3787b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cosmic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
