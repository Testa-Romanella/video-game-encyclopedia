There's not much to it now, just a few things you can do basically. The game is still in development and I just wanted to post this here. I would be so glad if you reported any bugs or glitches while playing! I'm planning to add sprites and sound effects\u00a0for a better appearance too. I'm not planning much with this game, I'm still learning and my goal is to finish the game rather than advertise it and reach more players. Also! I don't expect any financial income so please don't send me anything unless you really reaaallly want to.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/9733b159d10e1f51757b8a9ee295e59b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FemboyProgramming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
