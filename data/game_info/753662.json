I am a very rusty game developer who decided to revisit the old days of game dev after years of full-time web development. I joined this game jam just for fun, but unfortunately, I underestimated my free time so instead of a week I only had ~24 hours to work on this, around 3-4 hours a day, because I only found out about the game jam on Monday. <br/><br/><br/>Resources: <br/>The background images are from unsplash.com, I used the standard unity assets for the characters' basic movements and the characters are from the unity assets store. The music is copyright free.<br/><br/> I will come back and properly update the list of credits in a few days. Maybe, who knows, to improve the game too, if you wanna see updates?<br/><br/> P.S. Check out the game I am working on now: https://zascal.itch.io/we-build-cities Any feedback is appreciated </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efc5aef157c076e1eb9e65f47e574bdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zascal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
