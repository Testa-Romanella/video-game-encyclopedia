To activate web monetization the player\u00a0needs to activate a subscription on the\u00a0Coil site.\r\n<p>\u00a0Follow me on twitter if you like my game\u00a0<strong>@hav24\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>- WASD or Arrow keys to move.<br/>- Spacebar to jump.<br/><strong>GOAL</strong>: You need to put both character on the respective flag at the same time.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All assets were made by me,\u00a0 Alessandro Pezzetti aka havana24<br/>8bit sound effects made with Bfxr and Freesound.<br/>Background music by Playonloop.com<br/>Thanks to\u00a0Gonkee for the water shader tutorial on youtube.</p>\n<p>A game made by\u00a0<strong>havana24.net\u00a0</strong>Twitter\u00a0<strong>@hav24\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c23/c23307027b272fe02ec4d09a10ade9e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Havana24"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
