Shame on you!</strong></p>\n<p>Walk around with the arrow-keys, WASD or the analogue stick. Hold space or A (on a controller) to roll over any dice with a smaller (or equal) number to CRUSH them and score a point!But uh-oh, you're still a dice, so after the roll ends your own number will change! So you better avoid running into an even bigger bully than you.<br/></p>\n<p>Or... You just keep rolling. Except... Your last day at the gym must have been around WW2. The longer you roll, the more your energy bar (shown at the bottom) will deplete. If you run out of energy, you just HAVE to stop. Dice another day.</p>\n<p>Oh and before I forget: Even the lowliest dice will be able to kill you if you're NOT rolling! So you better stay away from these little brats whilst you're feeling a little unfit. There's a few more things, but I'm sure you'll figure these out on your own!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce1/ce1a6a9ada8fe7f2e866936a6b73020d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Njamster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
