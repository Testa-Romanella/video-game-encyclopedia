It was said that an asteroid would collide with the planet in the next century. The prophecy, indeed, was true and the asteroid met its fate with Earth, leaving it empty and uninhabitable. After the destruction, a new bacteria was birthed from the ruins of the asteroid. Advanced in size and technology, it had the ability to duplicate itself into enormous numbers. As a result, a new race of thriving bacteria plagued the Earth, forming a peaceful colony. After a millennium, the Earth finally became habitable for human life once again. A group of four humans, sent out on a mission during the previous disaster returns to their home planet but in a terrible twist, crashes upon arrival - not knowing what is in store.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploration</strong></p>\n<p>Traverse through the world of Astromeda!\u00a0Interact with unique\u00a0<strong>NPCs</strong>,\u00a0find\u00a0<strong>hidden</strong>\u00a0rooms, hidden bosses, items, hidden items, weapons,\u00a0and much more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Astromeda</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Astromeda is being solo developed by me apart of the music which is composed by Eric E.\u00a0Hache!\u00a0which really takes a lot of time and effort!
