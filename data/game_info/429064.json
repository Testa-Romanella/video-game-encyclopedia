You play as a 5-man group, using the traditional tank/healer/DPS trinity, to fight against a boss and a few trash mobs on each level. Bosses have specific strats you have to adapt to, while still managing the pesky mobs harassing your healer.<br/></p>The characters have a fixed set of 5 abilities, inspired by MOBA, and most of them have specific gimmicks to try to make them interesting (an undead barbarian leeches health to survive, a mad plague doctor throws potions that may land on the wrong tile and damage your characters, a lich steals health from allies to power his spells, etc...).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:08:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28b/28bcd570fe76546d1668ff75e4e76d46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maximelene"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
