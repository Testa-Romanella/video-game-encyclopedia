The game is non-violent and aimed at younger players, but more forgiving of poor accuracy than others in the genre. Players watch over the game's hero, Bo, as he absentmindedly makes his way through each location, dealing with enemies and manoeuvering him past dangers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/0199bd3cf4e3deebd58eb788914743aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Now Production"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": null}
