{"id": 452758, "slug": "use-your-outside-voice-richie-tozier", "name": "Use Your Outside Voice, Richie Tozier!", "name_original": "Use Your Outside Voice, Richie Tozier!", "description": "<p>Did you watch IT: Chapter Two and come away with a profound sadness and\u00a0an all-consuming need to ensure Richie Tozier and Eddie Kaspbrak received some sort of happy ending, a need that has fueled every atom of your waking existence for months on end? Congratulations, you\u2019re probably gay and have personal experience in constructing the intricate rituals people won\u2019t shut up about.<br/></p>\n<p>Use Your Outside Voice, Richie Tozier! is a piece of fix-IT fanfiction masquerading under the guise\u00a0of a game. The story is linear if not self-contained.\u00a0There is no way to lose. There is, probably, no way to fuck it\u00a0up. I am telling you now that there is exactly one throwaway Easter egg in this game.\u00a0Good luck. I love you. Let\u2019s try and write something new together.<br/></p>\r\nContent Warning\r\n<p>There are a few minor jump scares in this game, but they are quite literally the exact same ones as in the movie. The game does touch in some capacity on some heavier topics (re: suicide, homophobia), but once again nothing worse than in the movie.</p>\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n<p>Arrow keys to move. Spacebar to interact.</p>\n<p>Length is approximately one hour. Game should autosave at the beginning of scenes but not at any higher granularity than that. Note that starting a new game will overwrite this save.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE: If somehow you break the game or it gets stuck, you can exit out of the game and then select \u201cLOAD\u201d from the main menu to restart that scene. Please let me know if you do manage to break something and I\u2019ll try to debug it!</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:\u00a0 There is definitely a bug (a timing issue, if you don't make your choices quickly enough) in one of the last scenes, I'll get the fix out later tonight! In the meantime please just restart/LOAD the game and make your choices faster, sorry about that!</strong></p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Fonts</strong><br/>1. 8bitOperator (https://www.dafont.com/pixel-operator.font)<br/>2.\u00a0 Garamond (https://ttfonts.net/font/10981_Garamond.htm)<br/>3.
