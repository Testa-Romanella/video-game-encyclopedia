I want to make a game that can be played together by all ages and gets a nostalgic element from the traditional games of the past. In the project my role is to design game mechanics and implement them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After game jam finished i developed this game alone. I totally changed the UI appearance, added various menus, improved the map, added new modes, added item and score features.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: assets such as characters, map tiles and images that I use in this game are not original made by me, I took various assets from the internet.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>STORY</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A secret research lab located near the school exploded. The explosion produces dangerous chemical fumes which, if inhaled, will cause a gene mutation in weak human cells. Someone who mutates will turn into a Werecat. Werecat is really dangerous because physical contact caused by werecat can cause mutated gene cells to move, infect, or even cause death. At the school there is a group of children playing the traditional game \"uucingan\". They are shocked when someone who becomes \"ucing\" turns into a real cat (werecat). The children must survive to avoid physical contact from the werecat for one minute until the rescue team arrives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ucingan The Game\u00a0 \"Werecat\" has several game modes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic mode</strong> where the game is the same as the original game in the real world.</li><li><strong>Tag mode</strong> is a game that requires werecat to infect other humans to become werecat too.</li><li><strong>Elimination mode</strong>, which is a mode that requires werecat eliminating all existing humans.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:48:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/2619000d5626671807d477d31863a828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fathanarb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
