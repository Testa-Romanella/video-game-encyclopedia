The goal of this game is to end with each row starting with<strong> Ace </strong>and ending in <strong>King</strong> of a single suit.  A <strong>move</strong> is made by placing a card of the <strong>same suit</strong> and <strong>next rank</strong> into a gap.  When all gaps are behind <strong>Kings</strong> there are no more moves to be made and you may click the <strong>redeal</strong> button to shuffle the remaining cards and place the <strong>gaps</strong> at the end of each completed row.</p><p>If you discover any issues with this game, please email me at tyler.grimes@me.com.
