Other players can find and read these messages and when they do the message will grow, eventually into a giant beautiful flower.\r\n</p><p>We Are Seeds was developed by Emily \"Blackwool\" McAllan, Dave Reece, and\r\n        Ashton \"Acegiak\" McAllan under the MachineSpirit banner for\r\n        #ResistJam. It uses Ruby On Rails at the backend and leaflet.js and\r\n        OpenStreetMap.org on the front end. Thanks also to all the people who helped submit messages to be planted in flowers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/804/804c32b091c21e72285e6840e170b93b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MachineSpirit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
