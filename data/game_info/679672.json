It features several mechanics like the ability to quickly travel thru one place to the other via the city's sewer system and a stealth mechanic where you have to avoid getting spotted. There are alleyways where you can hide too, neat eh. <br/></p>\n<p>The game's narrative mostly focuses on the childhood fear of going home alone, especially for toddlers who live in large cities. You probably felt that fear when you were still in primary. It also focuses on the trauma of being followed around or witnessing those around you die.<br/></p>\n<p>It was created  on an archaic software called RPGboss with a remake on a more modern engine (ex. Unity) planned to be made sometime in the future.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys or WASD - Move</li><li>X or M - Open/Close main menu</li><li>Z or Space - Interact</li><li>*Shift (Situational) - Run</li><li>*Ctrl (Situational) - Walk</li></ul>\n<p>*Elaborated ingame, the way it works is kinda odd due to engine limitations, so you'll have to see it for yourself.</p>\n<p>Before you ask, no, there's no key rebinding. Infact the controls are hardcoded into the source code of the engine, so I hope it won't bother you too much.</p>Disclaimer\r\n<p><strong>Warning,</strong> this game is not for the faint of hearts.</p>\n<p>It contains these:</p>\n<ul><li>Depiction of blood and death (As is usual for horror games).</li><li>Depiction of harassment (It's literally called \"Stalker\" for a reason).</li><li>Very occasional loud noises, mostly in the form of screams.</li></ul>\r\nAttributions\r\n<p>Royalty free or public domain assets are not included.</p>\r\nDeveloper\r\n<ul><li>CyberRobotnix</li></ul>\r\nSoftware\r\n<ul><li>RPGboss (LibGDX)</li></ul>\r\nGraphics\r\n<ul><li>CyberRobotnix </li><li>Celianna </li><li>Starbird </li><li>Tuomo Untinen </li><li>Lanea Zimmerman </li><li>Daniel Armstrong </li></ul>\n<p>See also https://github.com/rpgboss/rpgboss</p>\r\nAudio\r\n<ul><li>JessKawaiiXxX </li><li>HaelDB </li><li>yewbic </li><li>Sigmarune </li><li>hectavex </li><li>Brandon Morris </li><li>Bart Kelsey </li></ul>\n<p>See also https://github.com/rpgboss/rpgboss</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:47:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb827dd284971e016cb8b6daf8d33ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CyberRobotnix"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
