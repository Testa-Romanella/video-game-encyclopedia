Determined to stop it from coming true, you must take your band of heroes and slay the Titans, absorb their power, and claim your place among the Gods!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tales of Casinthia is an RPG game based in the mythical land of Terra Deorum. It uses a 2D format with a pixel-art based art scheme. The game is in an early Alpha state that is being worked on independently, yet, it has plans to become a fully fledged game, complete with compelling characters and an inspired story. Feedback would be greatly appreciated as I would like to encourage audience involvement in the development of this game. Thank you for taking the time to experience Tales of Casinthia.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T20:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b415f1d457dd451eeb152d7c056faf33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mathewb1998"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
