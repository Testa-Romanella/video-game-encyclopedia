But be careful and avoid being too close to those explosive slugs!</em>\r\nHints\r\n- Slugs will jiggle when you're near them. This is an evolutionary tactic developed in order to scare predators and competitors away.\r\n- You will slowly shrink as you burrow your way through the dirt. It's tiring stuff after all!\r\n- Boosting yourself burns away your fat faster, better save it for when you need it!\r\n- Crushed bugs leave behind tasty limbs that will increase your muscle mass, perfect for fuelling your intense digging habits!\r\nControls:\r\n- Left and right arrow keys to turn. (or A and D)\r\n- Space Bar to boost", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d2abf3e3f44d4e4b877924ca5e95ad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HackTrout"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
