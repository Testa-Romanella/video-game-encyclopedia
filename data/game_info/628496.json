This mission is not as simple as it seems however, as Lucas\u2019s quest is constantly inhibited by strange individuals of all shapes and sizes. Join Lucas and his friends as they attempt to complete a menial task with far more effort than it\u2019s worth, with the same turn based combat and needlessly verbose dialogue as the first game!</p>\n<p>The combat in the first Lucas game was less of traditional combat and more like a series of individual puzzles that players had to solve. The combat in this one is more standard, so I\u2019m interested to see which one people seem to enjoy more.\r\n</p>\n<p>Features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>JRPG Turn Based Combat\r\n</li><li>A slightly less linear progression than the last game\r\n</li><li>Even more naughty words\r\n</li><li>Around an hour\u00a0of gameplay\r\n</li><li>Occasional need to strategize\r\n</li><li>Voice(?) acting(???)</li><li>And also more bad hairdos</li></ul>\n<p>This is a sequel to the game Lucas and the Casual Acquaintances, and just like in that game if you have any questions, problems, or suggestions feel free to comment them below or email me!\r\n</p>\n<p>Plugins Used:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>KockaAdmiralac\u2019s Follow Up Skills\r\n</li><li>Tor Damian Design\u2019s\u00a0Bind Pictures to Map</li><li>Himeworks\u2019 Enemy Reinforcements\r\n</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Core Engine\r\n</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Message Core\r\n</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Battle Engine Core\r\n</li><li>Yanfly\u2019s Battle Status Window\r\n</li><li>Yanfly's Quest Journal</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a41ce9efb750265e0e5d203f15eb08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
