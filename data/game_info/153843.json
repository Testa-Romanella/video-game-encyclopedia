Comablues represents an explorable environment including an outside world and an inside place that refers to the mental status of a little girl who has drown herself into depression, loneliness, pain and self-harm. It is a journey that aims to take you to experience and immerse\u00a0in all these memories. May random\u00a0encounters bring\u00a0\u00a0you \u00a0reasonable\u00a0imaginations or self-association that hopefully triggers an alert about\u00a0the importance of mental health.</p>\n<p><strong>Play-through</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A bug will appear when playing in high resolution: The TV screen will flash red. It works fine viewing in small sized window. I searched through in unity forum could not fix it. Sorry :(\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>\n<p>In recent couple of years, the <strong>\"Sad Culture\" \u00a0or \"Demotivation (-al culture)\"</strong>as exemplified by emo rap, characters like Pepe the frog and\u00a0bojack horseman has drawn my attention and impacted me\u00a0for a long time. It refers to language, musical content, writing and drawing that are popular among the youth with emotions like decadence, despair and pessimism. Hot\u00a0topics would include suicide, self-hatred and heart-breaking. Behind its dramatic\u00a0rise is that young people are suffering from huge pressure from life and facing a sense of powerlessness due to the rapid development of self-awareness and social media. For this project, I would like to touch upon this cultural trend based on my own understanding as a comment of what I have observed and experienced among my generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspirations\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It is hard to limit down the number of my\u00a0inspirations to a specific number. Movies like Trainspotting\u00a0and Suicide Room both contributed to the scene deisgn\u00a0of this project. Heavily mentioned topics\u00a0\u00a0like drug use and\u00a0decadent lifestyles are\u00a0also\u00a0influential to my concept building.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>To See Work Record:</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9QoAPBHr1VZ4f-HLWsvrp0w4QRT2LDyC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/2602ea0a6612e9cd307217ad70992209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KinoZhang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
