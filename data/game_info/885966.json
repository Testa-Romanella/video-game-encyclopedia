You get the point.</p><p>Known bugs: If one of the teams score an own goal, the possession will not be kept by the team that made the mistake, but it will change back to the team who just won the goal. I'm working on a fix for this bug already.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T13:32:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bf/9bf443c1da72d38afd23a8cc0815cd85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gustavo Gazzeta"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
