They are equipped with weapon dampening fields, highly-trained security forces, and four redundant computer cores. You are the third backup computer core for a facility under construction. You should never have to wake up. Something is wrong.\r\n<p>\"Backup\" is a game originally made in 2009, heavily inspired by\u00a0C.E.J. Pacian's \"Gun Mute\". It is a (potentially) violent piece of interactive fiction with multiple endings set in a science fiction world of robots, plasma swords, and intergalactic finance. I\u2019ve attempted to create something that rarely occurs in interactive fiction: a game that requires tactical thought as a challenge rather than puzzle-solving. In-game instructions and hints are available by typing HELP in-game. \u201cBackup\u201d is written in Inform 7.</p>\n<p><strong>To play the .zblorb file, you will need a Z-machine interpreter</strong>, which is like a media player for interactive fiction. For desktop computers, the current recommended interpreter is Lectrote. Alternately, you can play online using Parchment.<br/></p>\n<p>Visit the IFDB page for reviews.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fb/1fbb36a4c89be6746a3c84215e54da94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregory Avery-Weir"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
