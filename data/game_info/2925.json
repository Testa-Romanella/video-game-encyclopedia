{"id": 2925, "slug": "rebel-galaxy", "name": "Rebel Galaxy", "name_original": "Rebel Galaxy", "description": "<p>The most reasonable rule of trade: if the goods are from far away \u2013 they should cost more. If you apply it to the space trade between the galaxies, you will get Rebel Galaxy, a space trading and combat simulation, created by a small studio of two people. Western style is complemented by licensed blues and country rock music tracks. <br />\nThe universe is randomly generated, and players are taking control of the spacecraft, that can and will be replaced if needed. The game offers numerous activities for players, depending on what they are compelled to do. Salvage what\u2019s left of the spaceship after the battle, mine the asteroids for resources, explore galactic anomalies or befriend aliens and trade with them. Not interested in trade and exploration? Any player can take on bounty hunting contracts or battling pirates. Combat in the Rebel Galaxy uses shooting gallery mechanics: the player and capital ships are restricted by two-dimensional movement, all non-player gunships are capable of maneuvering on X, Y and Z axis. And all that in addition to the story missions.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2015-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:06:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/59f/59f8ff56cde745ceb56029f229ad4e43.jpg", "website": "http://www.rebel-galaxy.com", "rating": 2.97, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 218, "owned": 2039, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 122, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 185, "ratings_count": 219, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 222, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Double Damage Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Double Damage Games", "Double Damage Games."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
