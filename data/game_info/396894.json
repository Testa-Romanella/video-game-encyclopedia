The next player must draw without seeing what has gone before. When the head, body, legs and feet have been drawn, everyone gets to see their creation.<br/><br/>DrawX4 is based on the Exquisite Corpse, a collaborative game invented by members of the surrealist movement in around 1925 but you may recognise it more readily as 'Consequences' or a nameless game you played as a child with a folded up piece of paper.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T01:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02d4230d4de90e7c1907e7edc7da4db8_dC1nvp2.jpg", "website": "http://drawx4.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["I THINK & DO"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["I THINK & DO"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
