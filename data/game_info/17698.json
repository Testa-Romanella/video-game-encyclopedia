The game is set first in the fantasy world of Endoria, same as the predecessor, and then swiftly transfers to the world of Teana, where the main events occur.<br />\nThe protagonist has a task of finding the legendary knight of her kingdom, the previous game\u2019s main character, to save her besieged world. Role-playing elements of the game include three different classes for your hero, a different companion, which provides help in battle, and inventory system which affects your gameplay by adding various excellent or dangerous situations.<br />\nThe art style of the game is reminiscent of fantasy-themed cartoons, but it also makes every character in the game unique and distinct, with almost no animation repetitive or texture getting overused. The soundtrack adds to the immersion in the fantasy battles, providing a mood for every location and making a significant impact on the playthrough.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2009-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c7b/c7b096cd3105533133e3ae6ed3a9214d.jpg", "website": "http://www.kingsbountygame.com/", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 105, "owned": 1743, "beaten": 181, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 43, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 230, "suggestions_count": 612, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 231, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Katauri Interactive"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["1C-SoftClub", "1C Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
