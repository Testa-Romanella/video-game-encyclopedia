It's a remake of a MFGJ game from last year, that wasn't very good. Hopefully this one's better!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If you want, you can also get that good Game of the Year edition that includes an offline version, \u00a0that performs just a bit better as it is not in-browser, as well as the original version I made for MFGJ. It's a nice little thing to show off with. There's also nice words in there! Enjoy the nice words, if you'd like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b740a17d90ce98cf8403de588485d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["victoria lacroix"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
