Kill all the snowmans and win!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Concept:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><em><strong>It is already December, snow covers the earth and happiness reigns in the mankind's homes. You are a spooky Halloween guardian ghost and you want your Halloween to come back. Destroy all the snowmen to end the Christmas spirit. Halloween will never end again!</strong></em></li></ul>\n<p>For this #GreatAutumnGameJam2021\u00a0I created my first game.\u00a0\u00a0This inspiration comes from Tim Burton's movie:\u00a0<strong><em>The nightmare before christmas</em></strong>. The concept of Christmas and Halloween in trouble (winter and fall) helped me to bring this game alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move.</li><li>RIGHT MOUSE to move the camera.\u00a0</li><li>LEFT MOUSE to attack.\u00a0</li><li>SCROLL MOUSE WHEEL to zoom.</li><li>SPACE to jump.</li><li>KEY 2 and KEY\u00a03 for selecting weapons.</li></ul>\n<p>It's full of bugs, lighting, sound effects, and fps spikes, but I think it's nice for my first game.\u00a0I used the\u00a0color palette in all the assets but the lighting makes the colors a bit lost. The day and night cycle is represented by changes in difficulty and progress towards the goal. The closer the night approaches, the closer Halloween is. The day represents the happiness of Christmas and the night the chilling and frenzy of Halloween.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Godot Engine 3.3.2 stable\u00a0(Engine)</li><li>Blender (Modeling)</li><li>PureRef\u00a0(Research references)</li><li>Bfxr\u00a0(Sfx)</li><li>Chiptone\u00a0(Sfx)\u00a0</li><li>Jfxr (Sfx)</li><li>Inkscape (2d stuff)</li><li>Youtube (A lot of tutorials)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Extra Resources:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The only thing I didn't do was music and fonts. The music used in this game is this:\u00a0Kubbi - Digestive biscuit. The fonts used are: BetterPixels\u00a0by AmericanHamster.\u00a0I do not own any right over both. Everything else I did on my own with the mentioned tools.</li></ul>\n<p>This is my first ever game, any feedback is Welcome lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/018/0185bdbe4f27ed21d7615b5add86cdb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cvncer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
