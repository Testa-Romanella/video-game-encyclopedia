In this local multiplayer game you have to pray your way to glorious salvation, while fighting your opponents to keep them from being the deity's favorite.</p><p>Your deity effigy is always constructing, but you can speed up the process by <strong>praying</strong>, and speed it up even more by praying when the deity is looking at you. Additionally, you can <strong>bonk</strong> your opponents to stun them, and bonk their effigies to set back their construction. Be careful though! If the deity sees you fighting, he'll punish you with righteous judgment! </p><p>This game supports two to four players, and XBox 360 controllers are recommended. If you and your friends would rather crowd around a keyboard, the controls are as follows:</p><ul><li>Player 1: WASD</li><li>Player 2: GVBN</li><li>Player 3: IJKL</li><li>Player 4: Arrow Keys</li></ul><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><ul><li>Dan Lance - Producer/Artist - @gameDangerous</li><li>Michael Bartnett - Programmer - @MichaelBartnett</li><li>Colum Higgins - Programmer - @ColumHiggins</li><li>Sebastian Karolkiewicz - Artist - @Murder_Punch</li><li>Thom Strom - Music and Sound Effects</li><li>Tyler Caldwell - Music and Sound Effects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d1619a054440da7f176503b2da32350.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gameDangerous"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
