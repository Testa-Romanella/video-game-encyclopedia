This game asks the narrative question, \"What happened to Dad when he went to get the milk all those years ago?\"</p><p>-The team didn't have enough time during the Project Revival Jam 2 Itch.io challenge, but that hopefully leaves a\u00a0 better idea of why the funny man in space is carrying a milk jug tying to dodge tentacles and space worms. Or, maybe it doesn't, but that's just how it is.</p><p>This game is currently presented as a limited prototype. While it's a bit rough around the polygons, we hope that there is still a minor amount of fun to be had.</p><p>Thanks for playing!\u00a0Or reading, depending on how far you get.</p><p>-Team PLF.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d62c2f6e3258ecedd435255b71fbcef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Point Link Force"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
