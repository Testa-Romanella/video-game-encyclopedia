With his newfound \"DIAMOND HANDS\"-power, he fearlessly faces a giant force of evil to reclaim his games and reveal a hidden truth. <br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fighting monsters, shorties, deceptive vampires(*) and powerful sorcerers(*) adept in the art of illusion and trickery, he must reach the inner sanctum of the forgotten citadel. In the face of danger and the unknown, he must hodl on to his dreams and refuse to give in to fear!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>(*Vampires &amp; Sorcerers coming soon but there's shorties and slimes for now)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 This is an early prototype. Up next:</p>\n<p>1. Refine Map Design/Flow and create additional enemies and attack patterns</p>\n<p>2. Probably Hats? And energy drinks.</p>\n<p>3. Refine graphics, handpaint a lot of stuff :)</p>\n<p>4. Could build several intererior and exterior levels and possibly add options for custom skins / maps if there's enough interest.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>----------\r\n</p>\n<p>Imprint: https://lvl7.games/imprint.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T08:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d1080e39f8152f48bc5301b3d6eac87c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lvl7"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
