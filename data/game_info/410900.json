That's the goal with this upcoming Keith game! Explore\u00a0levels, overcome platforming challenges, and collect plenty of items. This game features\u00a0bright colors, a tropical theme at its core with lots of twists and turns, memorable music, and characters filled with charm. It's still very much in\u00a0development, but a demo of the current state of the project is available for you to play. Feel free to leave any feedback you have!\u00a0Donations are greatly appreciated, as they help me put more focus into the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e067cd39ab8c9076babb3d015a57ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Carothers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
