There is a pre-war simulation at the start of a game, during which several tile states should revolt against their rulers and fight for independence as new factions. Factions then proceed to fight other factions for tile dominance in order to spread their influence.<br/><br/>Battles with the player involved take place in battle scenes, in which units are controlled to either wipe out all opposing units or capture the enemy's flag.<br/><br/>There are gems in every world (unless the feature is turned off), and gems are owned by factions. Gems will always be magic-using units, and will either be mages or dragons. When a new faction gains it's independence, it attempts to steal some gems from the faction it succeeded from, and when a faction is eliminated, it's successor takes all the gems that they owned prior.<br/><br/>The first faction to own every tile in a world's map wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>note: pressing \"P\" at any time while the game is running will take a screenshot!<br/><br/><br/>Let me know if you enjoy the game, it's been a lot of work, and i'll be happy to add more to it if it's well received.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:17:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b988cc69cd18058ff73cf9cdf946e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["sprvlln"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
