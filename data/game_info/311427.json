Tracing larger shapes will give you credits (top right), these can be spent on making tiles or rotating the target shape. When a certain amount of tiles have been cleared (top left) you can regenerate the grid, but keep all your points. The game ends when the timer at the bottom runs out, but each tile destroyed adds time to the timer.</p>\n<p>left mouse = select tile</p>\n<p>right mouse = make tiel</p>\n<p>a / d = rotate</p>\n<p>w = next stage</p>\n<p>F11 = toggle fullscreen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3faaa84f7bb4b473aa9c0aa4710aac57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["5 Pyr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
