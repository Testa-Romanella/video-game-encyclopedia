You can read more about that here :\u00a0 https://haddadsa.itch.io/bunny-quest-2017<br/></p>\n<p>Changes include:</p>\n<p>Player movement, Holding/ Placing Objects, Lighting, Scenery, Loading Screen, Changes in puzzle gameplay, adding a little more direction to the game (some spotlights to show important objects)</p>\n\n<p>It was a fun challenge to go back and fix this old project, making some optimization and QOL changes felt very necessary looking back on the game now. I found myself wanting to add and change things, but at some point I had to put a limit on it, or else it wouldn't even be the same game. All in all I feel like I left this project in a better place and got to make the game more enjoyable. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:36:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be54719607f360ec20c2b308634281c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adrie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
