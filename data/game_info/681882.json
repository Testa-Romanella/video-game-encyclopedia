An upcoming mobile game, \"Numerical Measurements: The Week of November 28,\" features a group of teenage girls set to appear on the stage at a popular youth festival to perform their own actions.<br/>\nThe video depicts seventeen of the girls in a classroom, dressed in a letter jacket, with a group of three teenaged boys surrounded by their peers. Each teen is a collection of numbers from some musical instrument. These numbers, which are then plotted on a line, are gradually slowly plotted to produce a single waveform.\n\nThe video's graphic features a group of four white girls, in a dark room, making of \"number waves\" and \"razors.\" The first wave was made at school, and then at home, having been done with their peers and households' own numbers. The second wave, last figure, is made to be placed in the future through the use of \"rhythms\" from an imagination within the girl's \"complex.\" They are then displayed in a mirror, and they act out the actions they have made last night.\n\nThe video was recorded at a festival held at the Lakewood Independent School District in Woodbury, New Jersey, in November of last year. The video was published on YouTube on November 29th. The video was considered to be a commercial for the game, and was clicked on 3,493 times. The video has been viewed over 68,000 times and garnered over 500,000 views on YouTube.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/1394583eb6a02c1f15ec0526cb9ac04b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
