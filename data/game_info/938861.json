You have to keep the ball on the screen, to prevent losing a life. When all lives are lost, you may return to the main menu, restart the current level from zero points, or restart from the beginning with zero points. The goal of the game is to destroy all the bricks (by hitting them with the ball)\u00a0on the screen to progress to the next level. The higher the score from hitting the bricks, the better!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use the arrow keys to move the paddle</li><li>Use X, V or M to confirm or launch ball (X)</li><li>Use Z, C, or N to cancel (O)</li><li>To change the angle of the ball, you hit it while the pad is moving.\u00a0\u00a0Going towards the ball and hitting it will raise the angle, while moving away from it and hitting it lowers the angle.</li></ul>\n\r\nPower-Ups\r\n<ul><li>Slow Down - Grey: Slows the ball down for about 8 seconds</li><li>Extra Life - Pink: Gives you a 1-UP</li><li>Sticky Paddle - Green: Makes the paddle sticky and catches the ball. Press (X) to release</li><li>Expand Paddle - Blue: Makes the paddle bigger for 10 seconds</li><li>Reduce Paddle - Black: Makes the paddle smaller for 10 seconds, but the combo is multiplied by 5.</li><li>Mega Ball - Red: Makes the ball fly through non-indestructible bricks for 2 seconds, leaving a lot of bricks destroyed</li><li>Multiball - Yellow - Makes the ball into 2 balls. As long as one ball is on the screen, no lives can be lost.</li></ul>\r\nScoring\r\n<p>You score points by hitting bricks. The base amount of points is 10, but can be increased in multiple ways. By hitting multiple bricks in a row, the combo increases, with a maximum of 7. The combo resets when the ball hits the pad. However, when the Reduce Power-up is active, the combo is multiplied by 5 for the duration of the power-up.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All music and some SFX are by Gruber Music, as I cannot compose music.
