Murder Miners is heavily inspired by both Minecraft and Halo series of games. The game inherited the art style from Minecraft, while the core gameplay mechanics were taken from Halo.</p>\n<p>Murder Miners offers the players to engage in a selection of competitive game modes set in a completely destructible and interactive environment.</p>\n<p>The developers focused on the competitive side of things, hence why the game features wall-jumping, unlimited sprint, alt-fire modes and so on. This results in fast-paced, Quake-like movement and Halo-like gunplay. At the beginning of the match, the players can choose any weapon present in the game starting with a 3-hit-kill pistol, an energy sword, and ending with a deadly sniper rifle. </p>\n<p>Plenty of game modes are present in the game. The regular competitive modes, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Point, and Capture The Flag are featured alongside with a completely unique Infection mode, where the players try to avoid becoming a zombie from a bite by another player, and a cooperative mode.</p>\n<p>The game comes bundled with an in-game editor, which allows for the creation of custom maps. It is easy to upload the map for the other members of the community, hence why the game has one of the widest map variety in the genre.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/519a463edcb8e6594c7f4d1c4f5d6d59.jpg", "website": "http://jforcegames.com", "rating": 2.31, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 38, "owned": 1093, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 22, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 52, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JForce Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JForce Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
