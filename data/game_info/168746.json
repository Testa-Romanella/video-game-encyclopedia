This means that Guad can only hold one thing at a time. The art style is designed for clear readability while also just having a bit of a squiggle vision and cute charm.</p>\n<p>All of the programming, art, music and sound effects are by Will Data.</p>\n<p>This game is for Windows.</p>\n<ol><li>Made in Gamemaker Studio 2.</li><li>All art created in Adobe Photoshop.</li><li>Music made in the trial version of FL Studio.</li><li>Sound effects made with samples and BFXR sounds. Mixed in Audacity.</li></ol>\n<p>The font used is Timeburner by NimaVisual.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 1st GMTK GameJam. It was a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy my game!
