Play challenging missions in the Middle \n      East from the ground, Humvee or Blackhawk. You will need a quick \n      trigger-finger to finish extremely dangerous levels. Rise through the \n      military ranks and get additional and more powerful weapons differing in \n      features and controls. Replay the game to improve your best score that \n      can be submitted to the world ranking. Make combos and smash the \n      environment to get more points. You can take out enemies in a \n      single-player mode or with the added firepower of your friend in \n      multi-player mode! The Wii Zapper accessory is supported, but not \n      required.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/817f014e52c9d56f3a560124fc74c14d.jpg", "website": "http://www.heavy-fire.com/wii/home/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Wii", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Teyon"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Mastiff", "Teyon"], "esrb_rating": null}
