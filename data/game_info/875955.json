You are a typical young man of the era; brilliant, well educated, and\u2014completely penniless. For lack of other prospects, you turned to teaching some time ago. Yet when you take a position as a tutor at a place called Tennyson Manor, you soon find that nothing at the manor is as it seems.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nFeaturing Three Romanceable Bachelors!\r\n\r\nRen\u00e9 Tennyson:\u00a0\r\n\n<p>Loves: Opera, playing piano, horse riding\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>His mother hired you to tutor him, but you're actually rather close in age. It's strange, actually, that he should be tutored instead of sent to public school or at university already.\u00a0Still, there's something off about your new pupil, though you can't put a finger on it... He's quiet and reserved, but occasionally as sweet as he is shy. Can you break past his pensive exterior?<br/></p>\r\nWess Tennyson:\r\n\n\n<p>Loves: Gardening, Science, and London\r\n</p>\n<p>Ren\u00e9's elder brother, who has come back to visit alongside his new fianc\u00e9e, Marie. Yet it seems there may be trouble in paradise... Maybe you're the real companion he's been looking for.</p>\r\nHarrison Lorde:\r\n\r\n<p>Likes: Chess, History, Oscar Wilde's works</p>\n<p>He's a bit of a strange case, Mr. Lorde. He's the\u00a0former ward of Madame Tennyson, Wess and Ren\u00e9's mother,\u00a0 and he keeps in touch with the family, though it must have been some time ago when he was their ward. Still, it seems he and Madame Tennyson are great friends, though they're both rather reserved. Can you manage to charm this man of mystery?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While Tennyson Manor does not contain any adult content, or consider itself a horror game, it is still a Gothic romance visual novel, and therefore follows in the Gothic tradition.</p>\n<p>Tennyson Manor may use themes some players find distressing.
