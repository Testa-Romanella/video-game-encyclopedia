{"id": 391271, "slug": "titans-of-fire-and-ice", "name": "Titans of Fire and Ice", "name_original": "Titans of Fire and Ice", "description": "<p>This game was made for our Utah Indie Game Jam\u00a0 in 2014 (Theme was\u00a0 \u00a0Contrast). I love the idea of asymmetrical but balanced play. I came up with a game similar to \"Hidden in Plain Sight\" where you have to discover the other player by their movements, and the other player has to hide from you while changing the NPCs to ice.</p>\n<p>The Fire Titans and Ice Titans are battling for supremacy. Player 1 will be Fire. Player 2 will be Ice. Player 1 plays as a sniper trying to find player 2 hidden among the ice bots. Player 1 only has ten shots in which to hit Player 2 or he will loose. Any shots hitting bots will change them to Fire Titans. Player 2 must hide among the bots and not give himself away. He can change Fire Titans to Ice Titans, however they will still appear as Fire Titans until Player 1's light hit it revealing the truth. If Player 1 changes all the Fire Titans before he can be found, he wins. May the best Titan Win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebd6ae362df01d94fc468ab76abce461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greg Squire"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
