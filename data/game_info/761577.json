Loved the theme this time around, and had to cut so many ideas for this little game that I might add more to it and polish it up a lil bit.<br/>Also at the moment, the HTML version of the game doesn't want to work, I'm working on getting it up but in the meantime the windows download should work.</p>\n<p>The game is simple, all you have to do is keep the arrow tiles from sliding all the way to the left. There are 3 options to do so:</p>\n<p>Shield tiles block arrows until they break</p>\n<p>T tiles push arrows back until they break</p>\n<p>Crystal tiles remove adjacent arrows, until they break.<br/></p>\n<p>If only I had time to put a nicer tutorial in the game but thats how its been every time for me... But hey with the Extra tab maybe I can throw a status update on the jam too.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for giving this lil game a try.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a57b38dc0f94701e215b75ed31d32640.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["MusicBlox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
