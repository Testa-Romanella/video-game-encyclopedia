On this island, life is played by the beat. Llamas only do something on each beat of the music. (They do be groovin tho)\u00a0Earn money every 4 beats that can make the llamas lives a little bit easier! Each island is procedurally generated, so life is a little different each time you play. Have fun watching the llamas!<br/></p>\n<p>My Youtube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4UAbwMZQdi0UyGTORL6zPw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:36:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/2359c8d906b2e5e3b8d6b8939ec42e2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LlamaDev Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
