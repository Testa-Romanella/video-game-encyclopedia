On the run from the king, the player must tackle various missions to earn money, which is spent on upgrades for the plane; these upgrades range from new weapons, power-ups, and increased stats for the plane. These missions pit the player against numerous enemies above and below water for the player; ultimately, the goal is to defeat the King Frond\u2019s massive Man O\u2019 War ship and escape his grasp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aesthetically, the player will be immersed in a world bridging 16th century pirates and modern-day fighter planes resulting in a unique visual style. We want players to be immersed in this world, strategically upgrading their plane to fit their style of play with unlockable weapons and other boosters. By using archaic names for enemies and weapons the player will be brought back to sailing the high seas on a tall ship while piloting an advanced aircraft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The saturated coloring of the player\u2019s craft, and enemies will further enhance the player\u2019s immersion and harken back to older arcade games such as <em>Galaga </em>and <em>Phalanx. </em>Moreover, the games art style draws inspiration from Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s film, <em>Porco Rosso. </em>All in all, the player will be thrust into a rich game world. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f0/4f09ca2dd3506df99f2c5b6082a248ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ahnafnafee"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
