One that takes the genetic material of the corpse within it to produce a special tree.\u00a0 It doesn't take long for cemeteries to no longer be barren.\u00a0In fact, traditional tombstones end up being abandoned altogether. Why wouldn't they?</em></p>\n<p><em>The person's memory is preserved -- and reflected -- in what comes out of the ground. It's all you need.</em></p>\n<p><em>A man visits such a grave -- one belonging to his brother. It's not reminiscing that brings him there.\u00a0 The local priest had filed a complaint in an effort to chop the tree down due to its... abnormal nature.</em></p>\n<p><em>A dead tree.</em></p>\n<p><em>That -- somehow -- still grows.</em><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This is an adaptation of a short story I once wrote for a prompt. Incidentally, the prompt was the idea of the bio-casket, and, as such, I take no credit for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first attempt at making something more ambitious presentation-wise in Twine, and I'm personally quite happy with the results.
