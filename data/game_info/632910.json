It was to feature\u00a0them\u00a0getting into scrapes with its mythical monsters, and getting into arguments about the things that they get into arguments about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I had to give it up as it was really slow going with <em>RPG Maker</em> and I ran out of steam. All I had managed to do was about a third of the planned\u00a0introductory section set in and around\u00a0their home, though it was very polished and very cute.<br/></p>\n<p>This year\u00a0I decided to dig it out of my digital archives, tidy up what I had done, and give it to one of my niblings for their 18th birthday.</p>\n<p>So here it is... about 30 minutes of moderately amusing\u00a0non-violent pixelated shenanigans...
