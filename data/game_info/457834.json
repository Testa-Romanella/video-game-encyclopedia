Again, the elves are on strike so, they are bowling pins. In this newest version, however, you can pick up items that can be dirty tricks or bonuses. Dirty tricks are things like making you opponents ball half size, and less effective, or making the ball go out of control. Bonus items are things like speed boost or removing the gutters. The scoring is, otherwise, standard bowling scoring. Play goes to ten frames with the highest score winning.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-03T16:27:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/22635414109416dd928134d16c698ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hot Lava", "NStorm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["MumboJumbo"], "esrb_rating": null}
