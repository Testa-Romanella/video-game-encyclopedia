{"id": 483303, "slug": "the-wild-jamkay", "name": "The Wild Jamkay", "name_original": "The Wild Jamkay", "description": "<p>In the far far away asteroid of Telem VI lies... a small restaurant. A restaurant managed by wonderful creatures called \"Jamkays\". The Jamkays make the tastiest food on the universe, and so every spaceship flying near the asteroid stops there to take a quick break. It's a pretty busy bussiness, so the poor Jamkays have no other options but to throw the food to the customers! Pretty effective, but if something goes wrong... what a mess! They could lose their restaurant!</p>\n\n<p>This is a recreation and improvement of the minigame \"The Wild Tokay\" from The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, made for the first Miz Jam. Throw the food they want to your customers, while avoiding feeding the rats and crocodiles! If you give someone the wrong food (or nothing) or you feed a monster, your clients will get angry. If the happiness meter falls too low, it's game over!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check the How to Play section at the title screen for more info about gameplay.</p>\n<p>Also, check the Credits section to see who helped to make this possible!</p>\n<p>If you're interested in the game's code, you can check it at Github!</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game jam submission, so it'll be a bit rough around the edges, so any feedback is welcome! Hope you enjoy it, and don't miss on trying the coop mode with a friend!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9812569c859ff7084fa34d30c0c9c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ems_fm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
