Craft a powerful deck that will get you through expansive dungeons filled with enemies and loot. Escape intact and take your riches with you to rebuild a once forgotten town. Dungeonrite is inspired by the classic RPG's of the 90's. Begin with nothing but a deck of cards to defend yourself. Explore long forgotten dungeons with grid based movement. Collect gold and resources to help rebuild the abandoned town of Molden. Along the way, sell, buy, collect, and build your deck. That is, if you make it out of the dungeon alive in the first place.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Deckbuilding: The key to success is crafting a strong deck from 100+ cards to choose from. Start with a deck that can get you by, but when you construct the Card Shop, you'll be able to buy, sell, and manage your deck how you see fit.<br/></li><li> Card Combat: You never know what or who you'll find lurking in the dungeons below. Play your cards carefully in challenging combat that can either end your run or make you rich. <br/></li><li>Card Collector: As you manage your deck, you'll be able to keep the cards you aren't using.
