Just let me hack you and open a little window...</p>\n<p>(*opens https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/)</p>\n<p>... So, the cubes were addition, the lines were multiplications with a learned strength, and when you drew a digit, you saw the detected digit light up at the top, didn\u2019t you?</p>\n<p>Hehe, that\u2019s just how a neural network works. How it learns is a story for another time, but I have consigned some resources on the board in the next room for you, if you are interested (actually they are just above in itch.io)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a7e7214d2fe200099998a6bed2becb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sniapok"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
