Super Mega Baseball is easy to learn, but you'll want to master jumping, diving, wall-catches, power swings/throws and cut-off plays to prevail in season mode versus the CPU, or to dominate your friends in local multiplayer for up to 4 players.<br/><br/><br/>Super Mega Baseball is backed by a solid simulation of the sport with accurate physics, realistic statistical outcomes, and full tracking of batting and pitching statistics across individual games and seasons. Choose your Ego for a fair degree of difficulty regardless of your skill level. Earn Starpoints for your in-game achievements, level-up, and hire the best coaches and trainers to improve your team over the longer term. And of course, fully customize the name and appearance of your squad to your heart's delight with the in-game character editor!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Additional hardware required for Remote Play.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; playstationnetwork.com/privacy-policy). <br/><br/>Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense). <br/><br/>One-time license fee for play on account\u2019s designated primary PS4\u2122 system and other PS4\u2122 systems when signed in with that account.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:03:21", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
