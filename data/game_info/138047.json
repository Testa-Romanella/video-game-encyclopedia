The theme was\u00a0<em>Truth or Dare.</em></p>\n<p>We interpreted this theme by creating a relationship between the two players, requiring them to trust one another and to take chances\u00a0in order to proceed within the game.\r\nBy having the Navigator guide the Controller, it allows the Controller to easily avoid obstacles and reach the goal in the most optimal way. This requires the Controller to have a faith in the Navigator's guidance and by working together to get an accurate representation of the area surrounding the player they can easily make their way to the end of the stage.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>[Controls]</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This game is played on Keyboard!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>As <strong>Controller</strong> (Thumb):</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>W,A,S,D : Movement</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>R: To Restart</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>As <strong>Navigator</strong> (Eyes):</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>1: Restart Current Level\u00a0Navigation</li><li>2: Move To Next Level\u00a0Navigation<strong>\u00a0(Once Level View is done)</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>[Credits]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Unlikely Maintenance</strong></p>\n<p>Matthew Ferreira<br/>Van Tran<br/>Steven Ramos</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to ...</p>\n<p>Elijah Fisch for the sounds (@licoricefish on Twitter)<br/>CodeMan38 for the font</p>\n<p>MoJam : Montreal Game Jam 2018</p>\n<p>And You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d5fd4853e753e6008a736f93596d0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["5TEV3N", "VMan", "KeyItem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
