You are the only person capable of delivering the cure recipe to the CDC and stopping the virus.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n In this game you will encounter random events as you travel, and although some enemies may seem easier than others do not underestimate the power of the Aliens behind the virus. You only have one life, and every run may be very different than the last. You will randomly encounter enemies on your trip to fight the alien masters in a old school RPG style of game play. You will follow a path from the start until you reach the CDC with the cure. The CDC contains not only the man who can make the cure but the aliens who made the cure. And you just might be the one to save the world......<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf enough people play this game I will add steam trading cards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d631527089de741b6a2a955935a4bd07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordan Rott"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jordan Rott"], "esrb_rating": null}
