{"id": 281300, "slug": "boxthetop", "name": "BoxTheTop", "name_original": "BoxTheTop", "description": "BoxTheTop is a geometric intelligence game created by two independent developers.<br/><br/>Players try to estimate the number of boxes falling into an isometric area to increase their points. As certain scores are exceeded, players win different performance badges and the game level becomes more difficult. Each player gets a place in the overall score table according to their performance badges and score.<br/><br/><strong>PERFORMANCE BADGES</strong><br/>The game has 8 performance badges that are earned depending on the score the player has. Each badge game is a bit more difficult and allows the player to earn more points for each question. In this way, players can increase their positions in the rankings more quickly.<br/><br/><strong>LEADERBOARD</strong><br/>The overall score table shows the top 3 players with the most points and the game owner's position in the ranking. Points earned at the end of each game change the player's overall score and position in the rankings.<br/><br/><strong>GAME</strong><br/>When the game time starts, the boxes fall from the top to the platform and are arranged as isometrics. After the boxes are dropped, some boxes will not appear in the player's view, because they can remain behind other boxes, but they can be guessed by looking at the boxes on the bottom and side.<br/><br/>The number of boxes is estimated by pressing the numbers on the side and the user is shown on the screen whether the answer is correct or incorrect.<br/><br/>When the game time is over, the player's score is calculated and added to the total score. If the user does not have a performance badge, the scoring screen will be displayed in front of the player.<br/><br/>Have fun..", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73c/73c0bd636d366a433005028b00be2978.jpg", "website": "https://boxthetop.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Volkan Dagdelen", "Fatih Turan"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OXY GameLab"], "esrb_rating": null}
