The controls are c (left), v (right), and space(jump). The aim of the game is to get to the top of the world and get to the sign (The icon) before the boss (Only had time to make a red bar) Gets to the top. There are only 5 levels but the game is still fast paced and really fun. This is the first game I have ever made using Godot (Except tutorials) and keep in mind at my age its hard to understand everything. Overall i am really happy with this, seeing as i restarted my project on day 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95783b8c9237b5b61f97b25fe53ec74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nex_infinite"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
