The Karma bar under the Yin-Yang shows the level of light as opposed to the level of darkness.</p>\n<p>To balance these forces, you must hit the corrupters (enemies) with the opposing color, you hit a darkness corrupter with yang, and vice versa and the bar will stay constant. However, if the bar does move too much to one side, you can bring it back to it's original state by attacking corrupters of the same color. If corrupters attack the core (circle at the middle of the screen), it throws off more karma than if you were to hit them with the same color, so make sure that doesn't happen.</p>\n\n<p>Both Yin and Yang mirror each other's movements, so think twice before moving!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>LMB - Control Yang (white)</p>\n<p>RMB - Control Yin (black)</p>\n<p>Press one button while the having the other pressed for a nifty little switcheroo!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Credits: Music from OpenGameArt and SFX from Kenny's Assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:50:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9c86835c62fc73a81dafe97bdca249.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zephTheDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
