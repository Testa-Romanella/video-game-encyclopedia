It's fairly simple, and\u00a0a bit rough around the edges, but I think still quite fun to play ! The game features 3 modes :</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Classic</strong> : Very similar to the original Pong, a good warm-up for the other modes</li><li><strong>Double Trouble :\u00a0</strong>Control two paddles at once, either by yourself or with a coop partner. Practice your left/right hand coordination or your social skills !</li><li><strong>Madness :\u00a0</strong>This one is a bit wild. Give it a try if you're looking for a twist on the traditional 1v1 Pong gameplay.</li></ul>\n<strong>Controls :</strong>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>Left and Right arrows</strong> to move the paddle in <em>Classic</em> and <em>Madness</em>, <strong>W and S</strong> to move the secondary paddle in <em>Double Trouble</em>.\u00a0<strong>Mouse clicks</strong>\u00a0in main menu. <strong>Escape\u00a0</strong>to exit a mode and go back to the main menu.</p>\r\nNotes :\r\n<ul><li><strong>Reset :\u00a0</strong>if the ball gets stuck for any reason, just wait a couple of seconds and it will be reset.</li><li><strong>Bonuses in Madness mode</strong> :<ul><li>Size (green): expands the size of your paddle for a few seconds</li><li>Speed (orange) : temporarily makes the ball and your paddle faster\u00a0</li><li>Points (blue) : for the duration,\u00a0each goal scored grants you 2 points instead of 1.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><em>Thank you for playing, and don't hesitate to leave some feedback in the comments\u00a0;)</em></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Learn about the original game:\u00a0https://www.ponggame.org/</p>\n<p>Music purchased from Andrey Sitkov :\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/andrey-sitkov</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efcd6aebb0f29f0b983a7807978fd3d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vincent Reynier"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
