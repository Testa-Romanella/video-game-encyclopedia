Use your trusty swords and explosives to smack down bats and demons while dodging other dangerous traps!</p>\n<p>But be warned... it will not be easy. Hehehe...</p>\n<p>CONTROLS \ud83c\udfae:</p>\n<p>Mouse Cursor: Aim Throwing Swords</p>\n<p>Mouse L-Click: Throw Sword</p>\n<p>Mouse R-Click: Plant/Detonate Bomb</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D: Movement</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>You have two swords at your disposal to launch at enemies. Once a sword is thrown the only way to get it back is to catch it or wait until it strikes an enemy.</p>\n<p>You only have one bomb with a decent radius for rounding up and killing enemies, but be aware that the explosion from it can kill you as well, so keep your distance!</p>\n<p>Avoid other traps and obstacles such as spikes or fire. These can't be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Chests are a risk and reward, either giving you some points or an active bomb.</p>\n<p>Gold Coins will occasionally spawn for brief moments and increase your score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:54:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552cea5e0aea1ca87a836305347faf26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Commander Labs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
