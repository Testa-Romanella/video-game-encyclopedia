Archon of Doom indeed...<br/><br/>A cultist draws a pentagram on the ground, holds the forbidden Nox Codex and reads from one of its red inked pages. The cultist chants the Omnia Infernum, and as the last syllable is spoken, is levitated several feet into the air and begins to scream uncontrollably. The spirit of the speaker is ripped away, hurtling into a chasm of darkness, and the anguished voice now becomes the peal of a deep rumbling laughter and the figure returns to the ground on which the arcane symbol was drawn. <br/><br/>What now stands in the body of the cultist is no longer a human being - but an Archon of Doom - who intends to conquer everything in this realm with the aid of its Celestial Court of worshippers and allies. It turns its attentions to its immediate surroundings and begins to put into action a diabolical plan... There will be blood!<br/><br/>In Archons of Doom, you will take on the role of a powerful and evil being that seeks to conquer universe! You have a host of creatures you can summon from your dark court, all of which serve you until death - and sometimes beyond it as well. You are up against another Archon of Doom in each of these realms that seeks to thwart your will and take over the universe themselves. Both Archons will have to fight any independent creatures - the defenders of their realms. You have to destroy the enemy Archon to win the realm.<br/><br/>The game plays out as a turn based clash of wills, expressed as an exploration into the unknown and featuring hidden movement, line of sight, summoning reinforcements during the game, arming up yourself and your followers and seeking out valuable treasures to gain a tactical advantage. Creatures can fly, return to life when slain, drain the lifeforce from others, charm foes onto your side and even steal the very weapons right from the very hands of your foes! Some creatures can be ridden by others, some are amphibious, some may walk through walls and other solid objects, some divide in two and slowly take over the map, some create more of themselves when they get a kill...<br/><br/>Archons are powerful magic users that can use spells to influence the battle field and destroy their enemies. They can also draw powerful magical circles on the ground and bask units in them to boost their normal powers to greater levels. However, you must always protect your Archon - lose it and all the creatures controlled are instantly, Doomed... costing you the realm.<br/><br/>Only the strong will survive. All else are Doomed...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42c/42cd8bf53e4067e7c351d23a1ed706a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 407, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Third Impression"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Third Impression"], "esrb_rating": null}
