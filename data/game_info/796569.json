The game features a town in the 18th century that's been covered in darkness and shadows. Throughout the story you will unveil a priest's dying wish to reignite its town's light source, to save it from complete darkness. You as a player will campaign through The City of Lights and Bells with the objective to reach the cathedral and ignite the town's heart before it's too late.</p>\n<p>This is a school project made by a team of 12 game developer-students at The Game Assembly, Stockholm, as our 4th project. The game was made in our inhouse engine over the time of 8 weeks, half-time.</p>\n<p><strong>Team: </strong>Light Mode</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong> Kalle Lindberg, Klaudia Milewska, Sean Bolster, Borna Andersson, Arvid Hjorth</p>\n<p><strong>Level Design: </strong>Pontus H\u00e5llberg, Simon Ottosson, Roman Kunteleev</p>\n<p><strong>Programming: </strong>Mathias Boman, Tobias Rasmusson, Martin Nilsson, Viktor Rissanen</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong>\u00a0Kalle Lindberg<br/></p>\n<p><em>External</em></p>\n<p><strong>Voice Acting: </strong>Brandon Au</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong>\u00a0Shahead Mostafafar, artlist.io (level 7-9)</p>\n<p><strong>SFX: </strong>soundsnap.com, zapsplat.com, pixabay.com, fesliyanstudios.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T13:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea467262f1eaefba6a37a77d0cd53e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kung_boman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
