{"id": 652043, "slug": "jumplines", "name": "Jumplines", "name_original": "Jumplines", "description": "<p>This is a short (for now) platformer game with a constantly changing map.</p>\n<p>Movement:\r\n<br/>- You move using awsd or arrows,\r\n<br/>- You need to jump onto latches (these are the circles with green insides). After you touch one, you have a short period of time where you can change directions,\r\n<br/>- After jumping for the first time you are constantly moving.</p>\n<p>What's safe:</p>\n<p>- You can only touch latches and speed changes (and the portals in the playground, more explained in Map), otherwise you'll lose,\r\n<br/>- Speed changes are circles with arrows (blue circle with 1 navy\u00a0arrow, purple circle\u00a0with 2 magenta arrows or pink circle with 3 red arrows)\u00a0inside. As you can guess, it changes how fast you'll move,\r\n<br/>- Everything else is dangerous.\r\n</p>\n<p>Map:\r\n</p>\n<p>- At first you start at playground. Everytime you die you'll be respawned here. It doesn't change at all and you can test the mechanics of this game in it,<br/>- If you go into one of the rotated squares that are placed in each side of the map, you'll be teleported into the main level of this prototype. It presents the changing map mechanics and includes speed changes (they aren't in the playground),\r\n<br/>- The main level only lasts for 6 seconds and then it basically changes into another version of the playground. It contains all of the speed changes and a bit harder \"gameplay\".</p>\n<p>Since it's a prototype it doesn't have music and not much decoration. Also, the levels will be changed with new updates.\u00a0Hope you enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87dddd6add7849303b5e47b90fc1088.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bonsix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
