The theme was \"Signals\".<br/></p>\n<p>Dog Walk is a competitive 2-player game. You are a thought in a dog's brain. Your goal is to navigate through this dog's brain to make the dog walk towards a fire hydrant, surfing along axons and dodging dangerous neurotransmitters along the way. Scramble the rival dog's brain by rewiring its neurons and placing dangerous traps to ensure that your enemy's thoughts never reach their destinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Players alternate between\u00a0creating the most difficult possible levels for each other and trying to beat each other's levels. When creating your level, create and remove connections between neurons to make the path as confusing as possible. Drag traps onto the paths in order to confuse and inhibit your components. Your opponent will then attempt to navigate through this level to reach the destination node in the brain. The less time it takes for your opponent to reach his goal, the more progress his dog will make towards the fire hydrant.</p>\n<p>But don't get too comfortable! After your opponent makes his way through your maze, it will be his turn to make a maze for you! The game ends once a player's dog reaches the hydrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (when editing level)</strong>:<br/>Click on an existing connection to sever it.<br/>Click on a blank pathway to create a new connection.<br/>Drag traps onto connections to add them to your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (when playing the level)</strong>:<br/>Left and Right to change path.<br/>Up to travel along current path.</p>\n<p><strong>Source code</strong>:\u00a0https://github.com/Chaosed0/DogWalk<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Joshua Soldate - 3D Modeling, Animation, Texturing</li><li>Ed Lu - Programming</li><li>Andrew Hung - Programming</li><li>Robert Ackley - Programming</li><li>Edward Yang - 2D Art, UI</li><li>Matt Boerner - Music, SFX</li><li>Dennis Bestafka - Music, SFX</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55a/55aca7ac718f906b6f29bc5e70632296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ArtForger", "chipfunk89", "Robert Ackley"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
