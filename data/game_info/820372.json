Spend tokens to upgrade your weaponry at vending machines (press f to interact). The roll you get determines what type of explosive your dice will use, and higher numbers have more effect. To start with, all your dice numbers will have the same explosion type, but vendors allow you to purchase different types of dice. How long can you survive, pushing your way through blocked doorways, pursued by an ever growing hoard of guards?</p>\n<p>Left click to shoot, WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Our team:</p>\n<p>AXYL - Dev</p>\n<p>Ignavus - Dev/Designer</p>\n<p>Jlor - Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T00:39:08", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AXYLDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
