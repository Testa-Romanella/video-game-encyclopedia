We incorporated two of the theme words, Snail and Crime, into our game, and throughout the game you will solve a case. You should start by going to the park, as this is where the robbery took place. The aesthetics of our game are supposed to give off a city feel, with the streets and buildings nearby. You use the arrow keys to move around and find who you need to talk to to do your detective work. While writing this game, it was a struggle to make the story have layers and multiple locations to go to, and creating a lot of the locations. It was definetly a joy to see it come together though, as we created a small world for our character to explore.</p>\n<p>Game Art source: Snail:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/snail-1\u00a0City:\u00a0https://emily2.itch.io/modern-city-top-down-tileset-16x16\u00a0Background:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-night-city\u00a0Girl hair:\u00a0https://pixy.org/114950/\u00a0Skull:\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skull_%26_Crossbones_BW.png\u00a0Mustache:\u00a0https://pixabay.com/vectors/moustache-handlebar-mustache-male-473661/\u00a0Coin:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/coin-0\u00a0Jail bars:\u00a0https://pixabay.com/illustrations/cage-bars-cell-jail-prison-1161869/\u00a0Music: Menu background:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/tyops/sounds/436413/\u00a0Main theme:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/tyops/sounds/401770/\u00a0Mobile sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/albertofrog/sounds/212675/\u00a0Police car approaching:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/genghis%20attenborough/sounds/69644/\u00a0Boss music:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/zagi2/sounds/502964/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e8f6f10d443824facef6ae23e05ef07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cadecaptain"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
