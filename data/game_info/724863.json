Test your reflexes while trying to avoid obstacles in a foggy environment(spoiler: the speed increases over time). You can also collect the currency of the future while doing all of that for extra points: cryptocurrencies. You can pick up Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, Vertcoin and some more. There is also a special category called \"Did you know?\" dedicated to those currencies if you want to read and find out interesting facts about those. This is version 1.0.0.0. You can expect different improvements, like: a shop where you can use the cryptocurrencies that you have collected for buying different in-game things;multiplayer split screen, acces to some features while they are still in early phase, etc. All of the trademarks and simbols are used with permission(or they were on public domain). Do not under any form use them after changing how they look,etc.(do not be a \"reseller\").</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea8bff134ab47e02009bd0f779a00fa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndreiB368"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
