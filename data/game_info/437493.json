{"id": 437493, "slug": "the-sellery-circus", "name": "The Sellery Circus", "name_original": "The Sellery Circus", "description": "<p><em>The Sellery Circus\u00a0</em>is, currently, a very early-stage prototype of what I hope to develop into a longer visual novel that tells the story of Stick O. Sellery and Tommy A. Toe, two oddball characters whose designs are based on celery and tomatoes.<br/></p>\n<p>I created this prototype for a class, but I had created the characters and basic premise much earlier, and have always wanted to do something with them. My hope is that I'll be able to develop\u00a0<em>The Sellery Circus\u00a0</em>into a much more polished and well-realized\u00a0passion project in the future. For now, I\u00a0hope you enjoy the beginning of the story of Stick O. Sellery and Tommy A. Toe.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p><ul><li>All music is from Miitopia, which is owned and copyrighted by Nintendo.</li><li>\"Button Click 1\" by Mellau on freesound.org</li><li>\"Please write me a song\" font by Vanessa Bays:\u00a0http://bythebutterfly.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:59:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a374d7cacf889a58ed5bc31042644b8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ethan Godwin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
