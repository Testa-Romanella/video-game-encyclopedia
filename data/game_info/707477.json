If it was originally, I created the game imagining what would happen when the things I had seen were not properly visible. And\u00a0Inspired by the submarine's use of sonar in the water.<br/>It is designed to make the player feel unknown fear by using only 'SONAR' equipment that shows only the outline of the surrounding objects in a trapped space where nothing is seen.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>--NOTICE--</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We are not native English speakers.
