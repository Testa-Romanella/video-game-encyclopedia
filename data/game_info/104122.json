Aside from being surrounded by unfamiliar faces and a culture different from her own, her new life promises to be more than just a little exciting when she uncovers a terrible secret. Between spilled blood, sacred gold and a rumored curse, can Lucienne find out who the liars are, and whom she can trust? <br/></p>\n<p>A short visual novel where players will need to put their skills at investigation and deduction to the test. Contains dialogue choices, point and click elements and two different endings.<br/></p>\n<p>~~~<br/></p>\n<p>This is an old project from 2014, before I had an HD screen. As such, the images are optimized for a screen size of 1366 x 756. I may come back to this game at some point and upscale the images for a better experience, but at the moment that is not a priority. Also note, while this prologue is technically completed and fully playable, it does not tell the whole story! You are free to imagine the greater context and who knows, maybe there will be a continuation at some point...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c45f4a8ba4003b64e676e9954041f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["playpeachy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
