This game is\u00a0<strong>WAY MORE SCARIER</strong> than the last game. It will make you go\u00a0<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</strong> so be beware and take caution... And make sure to play the first game first and this second or else Jack, Jerk, and their new friends will hide under your stairs and go\u00a0<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</strong> which makes you go\u00a0<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</strong> on the stairs and\u00a0<strong>DIE!</strong> Additionally, this game is not in 2D, not in 3D, not 4D, not even in 5D. This game is in <strong>6D</strong>!
