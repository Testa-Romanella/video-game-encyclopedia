The concept of this game is for the player to get through all three levels to get the soccer ball inside the goal (in level 3). Different mass, texture, physics materials, gravity, and C# coding has been used to complete this exercise. The first level is simple just navigating through obstacles. The second level requires the player to balance the ball across the\u00a0 bridge and the ramp. The third level requires the player to knock down dominos, balance through a bridge, and navigate around a tight obstacle space to get to the goal.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T10:33:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a4732217c5f1f354283912b1a57875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["junkim20"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
