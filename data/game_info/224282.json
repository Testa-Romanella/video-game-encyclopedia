The main goal is to hold a city while an army of zombies tries to overpower and capture your base. You can try fast expansion, but it could stretch your forces lotto far so you won't be able to defend properly. Alternatively you can try to hold limited territory, but you will be facing a resource shortage in a week or so. All maps have numerous strategic possibilities so you can tailor your tactics. Your play style will be highly dependant on the units you'll have selected. Choose wisely. Will you use artillery to kill enemies at distance? Or, will you stick to close combat using infantry and barricading buildings to win?<br/><br/>The year is 2053. An unknown bio-weapon has been released from top secret laboratories and has now turned 86% of the world\u2019s population into unnatural abominations. Only a secret military group, known as Iron Corps can put an end to this global threat.<br/><br/>NOTE ABOUT IN APP PURCHASES:<br/>The in app purchases are completely optional.
