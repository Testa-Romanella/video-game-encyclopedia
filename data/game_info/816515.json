The two halves would then make contact with Earth, causing Earth to explode. He tried to warn the people, but unfortunately he was ignored by the leaders of the Earth\u2026 until it was too late.\u00a0</p>\n<p>99 years have passed since Trephor made his prediction, and now we can clearly see the comet (codenamed XORF-2261) making its way to the moon and will collide with it in exactly 12 months time.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a last ditch effort, the leaders have sent you to the moon to build a defense station to blow up the comet in its path. If we\u2019re lucky, we may be able to narrowly avoid this disaster and live to tell the tale.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T06:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05aa1857b1805b1bd58e0e658fe3ac5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["whiskeylover"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
