{"id": 3463, "slug": "resogun", "name": "RESOGUN", "name_original": "RESOGUN", "description": "<p>In Resogun, the player pilots a small futuristic airship trying to shoot down wave after wave of airborne enemies. Its graphics are based on voxels (3D pixels), which provide a simple yet colorful visual style reminiscent of Lego constructions or pixel art. All five levels vaguely remind neon-lighted, skyscraper-dominated metropolises at night. They are also based on an unusual cylindrical, ring-shaped design. The levels rotate when the airship moves right or left and scroll when you fly up or down. Each level ends with a boss fight. <br />\nEliminating enemies is the main objective in Resogun, but there\u2019s also an optional objective to save the prisoners from their cages. Rescuing humans earns the player additional points, which is essential to set the high score. There are three modes: the Arcade mode, in which you simply pass through the consecutive levels; the Single Level mode, in which your goal is to obtain the highest score on a certain level; and a cooperative multiplayer for two. The player can select one of three airships that have different characteristics. Difficulty can also be adjusted on a scale from Rookie to Hero.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2013-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-10T18:32:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be0/be0d47d4bcf4e39de33c8d541dce94f8.jpg", "website": "http://us.playstation.com/ps4/games/resogun-ps4.html", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 1488, "beaten": 143, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 150, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 294, "ratings_count": 319, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 319, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Housemarque", "Climax Group", "XDev Studio Europe"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
