In no way actually affiliated with the Fire Emblem franchise. Now that this note is out of the way, onto the meat and bones.<br/><br/>Link Burden follows the journey of fourteen fighters as they rebel against a tyrannical monarchy. \u00a0A short game with a few maps and a variety of weapon types, along with the typical big three seen most often. Each character has their own stat growths, upgraded class as well as skills. Features a weapon rank-lite system, wherein leveling gives access to higher ranked weapons. <br/><br/>If you have any comments, bug reports or if you want to yell at me, comment section is open below for such. Yes, I know what balance is. No, I don't think I will implement it. In the case of bug reports, include <em>some</em> detail, like game version (2.3, 2.2, etc) as well as how you came across it. <br/><br/>Regardless, have fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T17:05:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3bb2d44c36b8f77ce58d69aec8a1f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mysterymage"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
