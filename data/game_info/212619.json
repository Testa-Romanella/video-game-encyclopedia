The objective is to collect tech from around the map and bring it back to the maker boss in the center. Each piece of tech gathered returns some time, and bringing 4 pieces (one from each region) grants a large amount of time returned. Try to get as many points as possible!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6101f94f4379e6d3f61b8019df6f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jacob Galoci"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
