We provide the visual experience of several scene effects in the game, and a survival mode of fighting to mecha \"sky array\".  we have temporarily provided two basic weapons for this game mode!<br/><br/>We will continue to update this visual experience software, and we will provide another game demo version in the future. <br/><br/><br/>With the development and evolution of artificial intelligence technology, in 2033, electronic intelligence gradually got rid of shackles of human beings, realized self-evolution, and became a new intelligent species on the earth. With the rapid development of human science and technology, the use of intelligent prosthetic limbs and artificial organs has gradually matured. The life span of humans undergoing electronic prosthesis transformation is extended to 150 to 200 years old, thus differentiating the new species \"Cyborg\". With independent thinking, infinite life and self-evolution, the electronic intelligence is unwilling to accept human control. Artificial intelligence has completely disappeared, and electronic intelligence has built its own social civilization system. The low fertility rate and the disparity between the rich and the poor have highlighted the disadvantages of the human governments. They have to retreat from the political standpoint and recognize the existence of electronic lives. As time goes by, the contradictions gradually deepened. In 2037, the united front of the human government and the Cyborgs launched a clean-up campaign for electronic lives which triggered the First Quantum War.<br/><br/>In 2052, Humans, Cyborgs and Robots has reached an armistice through diplomatic means to divide the control of the earth. The war lasted for fifteen years and left earth in ruins, Humans and Cyborgs lost 35% of their population. The number of Robots has accelerated to multiply doubled compared to before the war. In the postwar years, different life form groups no longer followed the social rules established on the basis of human beings. The era of human domination is completely over, and an earth society controlled by multiple life forms was born.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c187d2f5cde23f49af3e63e88836a3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeiJing FlyDream Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BeiJing FlyDream Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
