I'm the creator of this game, and I want to tell you a little bit about the project. When I was a child, I was fond of a game titled \"Starcraft Attack.\" It was played on a small handheld console called the \"VG Pocked Max.\" The graphics were crude, and the game was simple, but I always felt a sense of happiness when I played it. <br/><br/>It was my goal to recreate that feeling of joy in Text Tatakai. The game, titled \"Text Battle,\" imitates early '80s arcade games by utilizing nostalgic art, sounds, and challenges. However, the project goes beyond mere entertainment; the game incorporates educational elements by improving the player's typing proficiency as well. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I did creating it. Thank you.<br/><br/>- Balaji</em></p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://github.com/bveeramani/fbla-2017</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use arrow keys and the return key to navigate the menu.
