It often starts with a little too much momentum into the wrong direction and before you know it, your stuck in that routine. Getting out is really hard but the best thing to do is just to steer clear once the momentum starts building up.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You task is simple. Don\u2019t build up too much momentum into the wrong direction (right) and always keep track if good financial goals. Also don\u2019t forget to stop and smell the roses (I put in a few inscriptions to lighten the mood).</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>\u201cA\u201d and \u201cD\u201d to move left and right</p>\n<p>\u201cSpace\u201d to jump</p>\r\nFrom the creator\r\n<p>As I stared at the theme I only saw three words: your, life, and currency. I guess it\u2019s mainly due to the big steps I recently took in life and it started when I quit my job.</p>\n<p>From that first day I started looking at things differently. Mainly realizing what was important to me and what wasn\u2019t\u2026 Forgotten friends resurfaced. Bad habits become nonsensical. Shallow relationships grew sour. Expensive restaurants were boring.</p>\n<p>Three years later, I\u2019m in different country (ZA-&gt;CA), different career (webdev-&gt;gamedev), different outlook (materialistic-&gt;frugal), and happier than ever. Enjoy my game.
