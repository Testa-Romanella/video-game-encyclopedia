There are no weapons available to you, the only tools are thrusters to maneuver your ship slow or fast, a space warping throttle to move forwards through the obstacles as fast as you can keep up, and a ship phase out button to temporarily pass through obstacles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMissions can be completed as fast or as slow as you can handle so challenge yourself to reach the fastest times and the highest score for bragging rights as the fastest space captain around.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMissions are generally static levels so you can memorise the basic layout, however some obstacles have an aspect of randomness or timed events to make every run different.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck, Captain.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T02:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fab4bdaaa68830e2aaf1fac9d09f93b.jpg", "website": "https://tinyurl.com/y9663uev", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raithen"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fiery Phoenix"], "esrb_rating": null}
