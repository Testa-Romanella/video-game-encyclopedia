It's based on a traveling circus's arena and the player must control the trampoline and assist the AcroGirls get from one platform to another. <br/>Game's mode: The feel of the game is very different and amazing because it's made as a silent movie, just like the first movies in 1920's. It\u2019s in black and white and the only sounds you will hear are of a hand cranked camera and of rack time music.<br/>This game has two modes: classic high score, and arcade. Also it consists of 4 different power ups and many other goods for buying in store section.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e6b79bf86a8f394f355f61c192e99f3_hsWM7QN.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mehdi Karimi"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Mehdi Karimi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
