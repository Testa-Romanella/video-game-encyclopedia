The game jam submission has an unfortunate texture bug so if this description intrigues you I urge you to play this most updated version of the game!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A (hold)\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0build</p>\n<p>B(hold)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0set direction/charge shot</p>\n<p>A(press)\u00a0 -Interact</p>\n<p>B(press)\u00a0\u00a0-Attack</p>\n<p>A+B\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Pick up</p>\n<p>Select\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Inventory</p>\n<p>A+Dpad -PUSH</p>\n<p>INVENTORY CONTROLS</p>\n<p>B+DOWN\u00a0 \u00a0 - exit</p>\n<p>B+LEFT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- previous page</p>\n<p>B+RIGHT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- next page</p>\n\n<p>Progression:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press A on trees to get seeds</p>\n<p>Plant seeds during the day by equipping seeds in the inventory, holding A to build in the overworld, then pressing A again to plant.</p>\n<p>Pickup items by going up to them and holding B then Press A</p>\n<p>Gather wood by equipping the shovel provided as a weapon and pressing B on the tree (any item recognized as a short range weapon will work at the moment)</p>\n<p>Dig out the ground by holding B with the shovel equipped then hold A to dig</p>\n<p>Dig for rocks to build a crafting table</p>\n<p>Build a crafting table by placing down a log of wood then placing a rock on top!</p>\n\n<p>Mining: To place a mine first craft a hut using roughly 7 wood, then dig a hole and hold A to place the hut on top of the hole!
