It's a big buggy mess, the scope was a bit too big, and the build worked almost completely different to the game in unity. The section of someone talking for some reason got completely cut out, I am completely fed up with it, I think that no one is gonna like it, it's barely even a 10 minute game\u00a0(and I was working on it for 20 days), I could go on. Just try to enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T07:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ba/1ba4091ed979e43f2f33b2811c7998b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrazyGamingGuy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
