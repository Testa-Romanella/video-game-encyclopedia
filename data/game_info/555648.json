Some say you may need the mouse as well.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>This game is largely unfinished. There's no sounds, no music, no in-game menu. There's a general lack of polish and detail. As usual, I\u00a0overestimate how much I\u00a0can get done in a short number of days, especially as an amateur solo developer.\u00a0However, it was a good learning experience for more demanding animations, as well as more finicky coding. Sticking objects to curves took a long time to figure out and, even though the code is... crude at best, it is fundamentally something I can re-use for later experimentation.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:24:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2c25cc9f6689989db5b7f5023854bad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bearhunter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
