{"id": 247287, "slug": "paint-conquer", "name": "Paint & Conquer", "name_original": "Paint & Conquer", "description": "Easy to learn but difficult to master!<br/><br/>Paint&amp;Conquer is a turn based, chain reaction, strategy game that challenges players to fill a grid of 16, 25, or 36 paint cans with their own color paint.<br/><br/>A pot fills by 1/3 each time it is touched. Players can touch only one empty, neutral, or matching colored pot per turn. When a pot is filled and touched again, it overflows, sending 1/3 of a can of paint into the neighbor cans, filling them all with the own color. This way opposing pots can be conquered.<br/><br/>Played against the machine or handed back and forth between two players, the game seems simple until a single move causes a chain reaction of overflows. So suddenly an overwhelming lead can turn into a hopelessly lost position. <br/><br/>PAINT&amp;CONQUER is a fun game, it is filled with surprises, amusing sound effects and lovely animations of splashing paint. It successfully realizes a simple premise, making it an \u201ceasy to learn but difficult to master\u201d pastime.<br/>Paint&amp;Conquer is a captivating game because, akin to checkers or draughts, it contains subtle complexities and can be played casually, seriously, or at competition levels.<br/><br/>\"Paint&amp;Conquer has some similarities to the hit game Bubble Blast, because they both feature chain reactions that spread in four directions, but Paint&amp;Conquer is not a series of puzzles with unique solutions. It is an unpredictable, two-player game with an unlimited number of variations and possibilities for gameplay.\"<br/><br/>Feature Highlights:<br/>* Score 1 point for each 1/3 of a pot of paint that goes into any pot during the player's turn<br/>* Winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game<br/>* Game ends when one player has no possible play (all pots are the same color)<br/>* Paint cans or pots fill 1/3 at a time and then overflow in four directions<br/>* Play by turns<br/>* Single player game against the machine (Easy, Medium, Hard)<br/>* Two-player game, where players pass the device back and forth<br/>* Start with 16, 25, or 36 fields<br/>* Create a chain reaction when a full pot overflows and hits another full pot<br/>* Random prefill options", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c63/c63077fa8bd92ad128521d407a864319.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["COBBLECROWD"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Martin Leidel"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
