This short rythm game stars two young women, who convert an abandoned platform into a lunch spot catering to salvage divers. The selection of drinks and snacks available make the most of various canned goods, some of which undoubtedly predate the flood. Shinkai-ya's simplicity belies its humble origins as a hobby effort, but the realtime lighting pushes the classic console to its very limit. HAKONIWAworks is proud to re-publish this experimental game, as ported to this dimension's personal computers.</p>\n\n<p><em>Use the mouse to interact with the buttons, and the following keys for the rhythm segment.<br/></em><em>Arrow Keys: Direction Arrows<br/>Z: A Button<br/>X: B Button<br/><br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T04:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/925/925bfbca2e579a4ae619734d7559d10b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HAKONIWAworks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
