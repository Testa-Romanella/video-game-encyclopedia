{"id": 56844, "slug": "the-thompson-twins-adventure", "name": "The Thompson Twins Adventure", "name_original": "The Thompson Twins Adventure", "description": "<p>The Thompson Twins Adventure is a 1984 graphic adventure game that was distributed by Computer and Video Games magazine as a promotional 7\" flexi disc \"freebie\" along with its October 1984 issue (Issue 36). The game is based on the Thompson Twins' single \"Doctor! Doctor!\", and features the Thompson Twins band members as the protagonists. The unusual storage format of the game showcases an experimental technique pioneered by the London-based Flexi Records label, and places the game alongside a small handful of other games distributed on grooved disks. This format never became established and The Thompson Twins Adventure is today valued more for its nostalgic and artifactual value than for its ludological aspects which have been uniformly panned by critics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd57b63c215e9fe19397a89f48333a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Quicksilva"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Computer and Video Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
