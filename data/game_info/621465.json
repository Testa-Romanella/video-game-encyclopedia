For example, one section of the game has you talk about your life. The options you choose for your character get saved and are combined to form a complete short story at the end.</p>\n<p>If you like reading, then this is for you! There are no pictures, nor visual thrills, nor any visual variety. Just white text on a black background (the Twine 2 default).<br/></p>\n<p>This for those of you hardcore enough to be satisfied with good words arranged creatively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e118bbae235138aedce4a9733fda2d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phillingtime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
