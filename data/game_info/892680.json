A new color is announced\u00a0at the start of each round. If you don't get to the right color before a timer runs out,\u00a0you will fall off the map and be eliminated. Every other round the time decreases and the game gets more difficult.\u00a0The last player remaining is the winner.</p>\n<p>Choose either Easy Mode, Hard Mode or Survivor Mode. In Easy and Hard mode you will dance against 7 other AI players, and their skill level is based on the difficulty you have chosen. Survivor\u00a0Mode is the regular game but without the AI players.</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD / Arrow Keys - Move</li><li>Spacebar - Select / Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/ddeb333c6753ca4efc269409b071b5b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jokairo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
