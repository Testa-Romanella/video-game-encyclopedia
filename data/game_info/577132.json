So this game is for 2 players, one playing on WASD + QE keys and other on IJKL+ UO keys. WASD stands for movement of red player and IJKL for movement of blue player. Q and U are used to \"throw\" items to other player, if they have nothing in their inventory. E and O are for interaction. You can interact with for example fridge or vending machine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cooking burger:</strong></p>\n<p>As cook you can make 2 types of food. One is burger and other one is fries. You can make burger by going in front of white fridge and pressing E (you get raw meat) next you have to put it on the stove. So you just go few steps right and then you press E again. After waiting for 10 seconds it's cooked and if you have nothing in your inventory you will get it in there. Then you just have to go behind or in front of table with buns. Then you press E again and there you have it! Just wait for blue to clear his inventory and you can throw it to his inventory and he can serve it to customers that want it with O.</p>\n<p><strong>Frying fries:</strong></p>\n<p>I will short this. You just get raw fries from red fridge then you add them to fryer and after 10 seconds you grab it and there you have it!</p>\n<p><strong>Making drinks:</strong></p>\n<p>By going in front of vending machine as blue character and then pressing E you will get drink in your inventory!</p>\n<p><strong>Ordering buns:</strong></p>\n<p>On your table you can have only 5 buns. When needed go as blue character to that \"tunnel\" looking thing and press O. You will order package with buns. After it arrives you have to pick it up and throw it to your partner.</p>\n<p><strong>Throwing things in the trash</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can walk up in front of trash bin and press interaction button to clear your inventory!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Mechanics of game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>One thing might not be sure. Highscore = the most money you earned in past and turned off game with ESCAPE - that means it saved game and closed it. To see that\u00a0you will need to restart game propably, cause at first run or after resseting score it's not visible.</p>\n<p>And of course you can turn off that insanely annoying music :)</p>\n<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>\n<p>You can display or hide console by pressing TAB. Commands you can use (and what they do):</p>\n<p>/del highscore(Deletes your highscore)</p>\n<p>/del score(Deletes your current money)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a7e3a82915076fc246567f7d955ed55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidCitron"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
