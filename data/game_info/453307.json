Our\r\ncommunication skills were used to create clarity throughout the\r\ndesigns of the characters and the background, so everything reads\r\nwell. The NES vst was used for every single sound effect in the game,\r\nand using the noise with different notes contributed well to the\r\noverall sound. We also had to utilize shader graphs in order to\r\nimplement the core feature of returning color to the game.</p>\n<p>              This game is heavily\r\ninspired by Legend of Zelda and art supplies. The character went\r\nthrough a rigorous redesign process as seen here. Obtaining a working\r\nkeyboard was the hardest part for sound, as well as learning an\r\nentirely new audio program. Using Unity Collaborate allowed the\r\nprogrammers to more consistently keep up with each others\u2019 work,\r\nand improved communication and efficiency in the game-making process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2ddc18e0ab11036b1343201e0537f21f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wanicdigipen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
