He looks at his hands, trying to understand what's happening. In that one moment he hears a sweet melodic voice calling out to him, he at once knows it's his wife. She calls him towards their picnic spot, to lie down and just be with each other. But as he inches closer, he sees a figure coming towards them. As it inches closer mark sees what it is, a set of lungs on 2 legs, its emanating black smoke from itself and its creeping towards mark and his wife. Mark's wife says, we rarely ever have this moment mark, make good use of it, you need to fight your demons, you have to win. At that moment mark realizes, he is in his own dreamscape, and he can control a part of the situation. Seizing the moment, he imagines a suit upon him and to further aid him, his wife presents to him Shirudo, a levitating being providing him with protection. Now fully equipped, mark braces to battle the horde of black lung monsters.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Concept generation: Rohan Deb, Vijoy Philips</p>\n<p>In game mechanics,coding,rigging,ambience,envronment: Rohan Deb</p>\n<p>Concept art, story boarding, character design: Vijoy Philips</p>\n<p>Music and ambient sound fx by Dominik Giesriegi.</p>\n\n<p>Contact details:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instagram pages:</p>\n<p>Rohan Deb: @rohan_202_</p>\n<p>Vijoy Philip: @elfoil02</p>\n<p>Gmail accounts:</p>\n<p>Rohan Deb: rohandeb53@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Vijoy Philips: elfoil2002@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:16:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a617f262280c86318247bf1ee8e64cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lavritox204@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
