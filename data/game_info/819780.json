You do this by deciding where the room you died will show up again during your next run. So be strategic about which one goes where, as each room drops a unique ability that can be used in your next room.\u00a0And in some\u00a0rooms this ability might be useless, in others, it might just be absolutely broken.<br/></p>\n<p>Your goal is to ensure no enemies are left, meaning completing an entire run. Once all slots are filled, meaning you died 6 times, it's over!\u00a0Good luck out there ... you'll need it.</p>\n<p>PS.
