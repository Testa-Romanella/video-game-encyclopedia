All original story but with all the beats a classic RE would have. It has also been a self-set challenge on what one can do on this coding platform. Enter the mansion full of shambling undead to find what you need to make a cure. Solve riddles to advance to new areas, find secret items and weaponry to survive. Including combat against different types of enemy that may require different tactics as well as an inventory system. Enjoy the adventure!</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not own the rights to any other zombie-game properties, obviously. Also, for some reason, embedeed play on Itch isn't working in Firefox so you'll have to download the game and play it from your browser locally.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:29:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b1e57333c14dc7cf5778a2dd8f3515.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MadZab"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
