In Games 25-30 hit toy planes with <br/>packing items to wreck them and earn points.\u00a0 Planes turn red when they are <br/>almost destroyed.\u00a0 Movers shake the truck in game 30.</p>\n<p>Points are scored for every packing item that is behind (or mostly behind) the packing line.\u00a0 Additional points are scored for tightly packing items (packing items that touch each other).\u00a0 In general, the bigger the packing item, the more points that are scored for packing it.\u00a0 Balls, capsules, and cylinders are worth a bit more than other <br/>objects of the same size, because they tend to be harder to keep packed.<br/>Destroyed planes are worth as much as or more than the largest packing item.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f278c4d8d09ea2631abfbbb39eea96b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ricklev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
