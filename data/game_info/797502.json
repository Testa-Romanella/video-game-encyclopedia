The world is once again a safe place to go out and you have found a partly pre-made shelter that has the chance of becoming a nice underground settlement for your family and some others.</p>\n<p>Invite or decline other survivors into your shelter but always keep searching for a forever above the surface settlement location where you could rebuild and bring new hope for the future.</p>\n<p>Each turn you will have a set amount of tasks per civilian present in your settlement, you will need to gather metal, wood, tech, and food just to keep alive and upgrade rooms. You will need to send out expedition teams to scout for items and to look for your goal of a new settlement. beware at the end of the turn your settlement will get attacked and you might lose a survivour.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Music by a friend XaVioN\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T21:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5a/d5a6dac591e1bb9e773c507630ddc1a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Gamez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
