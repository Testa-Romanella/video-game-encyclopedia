The choices you make are vital to the success of the interplanetary excursion, as letting on demons in disguise (as evident by certain characteristics such as abnormal height, satanic tattoos [etc]) or 'negative assets' (those who are unemployed, convicted criminals, medically dependent [etc]) could prove fatal to your end goal.</p>\n<p>-=+=- INFO -=+=-\u00a0</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints we were not able to fully explain the character's profile however characteristics of a demon; Unusual height, Severely under weight, no family, tattoo(s) and no disabilities or injuries. What the character looks like should not be used to judge them since its just random.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0For the final stats:</p>\n<p>Total Demon - amount of demons you accepted.</p>\n<p>Total Skill Points - This is contributed to by the profession of the character; Janitor &lt; Astronaut. Disabilities or injuries give a skill point\u00a0penalty. This is also effected by languages spoken.</p>\n<p>Total Morality - Affected by conviction status and tattoo(s).</p>\n<p>Total Capacity - The total amount of people accepted (15) plus their total family members.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4c/e4c4a375ed5d9bc3297f426aa99ea528.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["joshuaemq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
