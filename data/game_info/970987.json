The program is used in many schools to learn the principles of electronic devices, processors and programming languages.  No prior knowledge of any IT issues is required - we start with simple tasks and step by step learn the basics of computer programming.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Lesson 1: Basic Logic - You learn the basic logical operations.<br/></li><li> Lesson 2: Gates And &amp; Or - You build a machine controlled by electronic gates.<br/></li><li> Lesson 3: Exercises with Gates -  You learn about more complex integrated circuits.<br/></li><li> Lesson 4: Binary Numbers<br/></li><li> Lesson 5: Single-bit Processor - You write the first programs - lighting the lights in the machine.<br/></li><li> Lesson 6: Programming Microprocessor - Assembler - This is the first difficult, complex lesson: you write assembler programs in machine language. You'll see how the processor executes the commands, how the data is kept in memory, you will learn the basic instructions of the processor.<br/></li><li> Lesson 7: C Programming Language - You write simple programs and see how high-level programs are translated into the language of the processor instructions.<br/></li><li> Lesson 8: Objective Programming Basics - You program a robot that has to traverse the board with traps.<br/></li><li> Lesson 9: Computer Graphics Basics - You learn how images are stored, write pixel drawing programs, simple charts, test colors, and compress the image.<br/></li><li> Lesson 10: Hardware - Just a basic information.<br/></li><li> Lesson 11: Linux Operating System - You learn the basic shell commands, combine them into simple scripts.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T01:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/085b5c591296a3af32c9cd5260e2b919.jpg", "website": "https://adventure-sity.blogspot.com/2020/02/informatyka-zrozum-i-zaprogramuj.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wydawnictwo Dagiel"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Adventuresity"], "esrb_rating": null}
