In this game you get to play chess expanded across 3 dimensions.</p>\n<p>All the pieces can move in according the normal rules of chess. However, they now have access to move along the vertical axis in rules based on their 2 dimensional movement. Currently there is no AI therefore it is recommended you play alongside a friend or try it by yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the rules for moving \u00a0up and down on the y-axis however I do recommend playing for yourself to see how each piece moves:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Pawn - the pawn may move 2 space upward on its initial move after which it can only move one square at a time. When taking \u00a0a piece it can take any piece that is above it by 1 space and offset by one of the horizontal axes by 1 space (diagonally).</p>\n<p>2. Rook- the rook can move anywhere 1 dimension at a time (x, y or z).</p>\n<p>3. Knight - in each axis (x,y,z) the knight can moves 2 spaces (forward or backward) along one axis and then move 1 space along one of the other axes.<br/></p>\n<p>4. Bishop - the bishop can move anywhere 2 dimensions at a time (x+z, x+y or y+z).</p>\n<p>5. Queen - the queen's movements are effectively the movement of the rook and bishop joined together. This means it can move in 1 or 2 of the 3 dimensions at a time.<br/></p>\n<p>6. King - the king can move \u00a0in both 1 or 2 dimensions at a time. However, it can only move 1 space in a turn.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Right mouse button to rotate view</p>\n<p>- WASD/arrows to move horizontally</p>\n<p>- Space/shift to move vertically<br/></p>\n<p>- Click on a piece to see where you can move it</p>\n<p>- Click on the boxes that appear to make your move<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T13:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78f087f45ddee0aaf234276ee0f326c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpaceFire"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
