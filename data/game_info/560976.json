Normal Asteroids do nothing to the firing rate, giving 15 points. Shooting the aliens is worth 20 points.</p>\n<p>Click the download button and enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T04:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92d4169563bda38ccc75793bfd527d9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamingMan215"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
