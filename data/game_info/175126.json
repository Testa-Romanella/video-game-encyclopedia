There is no goal except have fun an make the best high score ! :D<br/>It's very simple, you play with arrow keys, and the space ship will shoot\u00a0automatically.</p>\n<p>During the conception of this game, my two main inspiration were the very famous Flappy Bird and Space Invaders. So Shoot The Aliens is\u00a0like the meeting between these two fantastic games. It's my first game so it was important for me to make a game with very simple mechanics but a lot of fun. I have done code, music, graphics, sounds and everything myself just with C++, SFML, a\u00a0graphic editing software\u00a0and an MAO software.</p>\n<p>This game is in beta for the moment, so there are perhaps some bugs.\u00a0If you find one of them, you're welcome to report it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c56/c5632c6376821959fd08ab2416b846ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paul Laffitte"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
