I worked alone on this project to\u00a0combine the classic arcade game Snake with minor RPG elements. Use arrow keys or WASD to control your Guild to move up, down, left, and right. Try to collect as many of your Guild's adventurers as you can.</p>\n<p>The game alternates between two phases:\u00a01) collect a new adventurer and 2) defeat the enemies on screen. Collide with the adventurer to collect them, but you need to come up alongside an enemy unit to defeat them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T11:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a12ea0bf1985f71f36e3c43b39c4ca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ginger Gamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
