The game is a pretty basic proc-gen dungeon crawler. You travel through floors fighting flower blobs, and you go until you die.</p><p>Along the way blobs will drop new loot for you as well as potions to keep you alive. The deeper you go, the stronger they will get so be careful!</p><p>In order to get around you can cut your way through the walls to reach new rooms.</p><p>There are DEFINITELY some bugs with this one, but it's playable enough :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab4/ab4d626e6fd9edf6a666b6cce3535d64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["threesided"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
