I mean, a drop in the ocean won't make too much difference, so here I am with another of these programs.</p>\n<p>This program has\u00a0 modern UI and controls. Hope you'll like it. Actually, the main auto-clicker program is just a console application. And the GUI application can be used to set the setting for the auto-clicker. You'll know what I mean after you run the program.</p>\n<p>You can experience app crashes. Sorry for that. Actually, I made this app on a different technology, just to realize that it was a bad idea. But at the end of the day, it is what it is!</p>\n<p>- Realinspirer</p>\n<p>P.S. - I want a girlfriend. And it sucks to not have one rn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0700d5ce20304260e0d7d9dce8c9d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Realinspirer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
