The game follows a nameable main character as they work at <em>The Red Herring</em>, a tavern-inn combo seemingly in the middle of nowhere, building friendships with a colorful cast of characters and engaging in wacky hijinks.</p>\n<p>The game at its core is a coming-of-age story for not only the main character, but for the people around them as well. While the main character is working at the inn, raising money for the next caravan to take them across the mountains, they will have the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with those around them. Together, they will grow as people and learn more about each other as well as themselves.</p>\n<p><em>The Inn Crowd</em> will feature...</p>\n<ul><li>The ability to name your character and choose their pronouns.\r\n</li><li>An engaging character-driven story with impactful choices, each with consequences.\r\n</li><li>A wide range of characters of different personalities, backgrounds, and identities.\r\n</li><li>The opportunity for a romantic relationship with 7 different characters. <strong>Romance is not mandatory</strong>.\r\n</li><li>3 unique and engaging food service mini-games.</li></ul>\n<p>This demo was made using Ren'Py, but the final product will be created with Unity.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Team<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Jamie</em>\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0lead\u00a0designer,\u00a0programmer,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0co-writer.</p>\n<p><em>Zack</em> is the artist, and a co-writer.</p>\n<p>Music: \"The Nightingale Sings\" By Robert Shaw.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>\n<p><em>Email:</em> goldenapplegames.dev@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Website | Instagram | Twitter | Patreon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T06:07:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9cc9262fec5602e05144e721d5eb7f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Golden Apple Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
