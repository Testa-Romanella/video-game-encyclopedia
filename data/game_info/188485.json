Of course, you do! Take part in StufCo's Accelerated Management Training (SAcMaT) today!</p>\n<p>BossMan is a 2D, top-down management survival simulation. You're the boss, and it is your job to make money by motivating unpaid interns to make widgets. Your form of motivation is a baseball bat. The interns will shank you. Failure to make widgets will result in termination by gassing. Survive for 28 days, and you might just find yourself with a more permanent position at the finest manufacturer of handmade knick-knacks in all the land.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 0.6.56: Now with more futile options! I've tried to do a better job of indicating controls and such. I've come up with a solution to a funky collision that's been bugging things for a while. I've also added a volume control function, so you can play on silent. The sound design still needs a lot of work, as do any other things. Feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1abd07615391e8cc9136e2c46f90e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamblefoot"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
