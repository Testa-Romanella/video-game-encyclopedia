Attend to your domain, border to border, or venture into the wild to discover its wonders and its threats. Master the land, build your defenses, and when the darkness comes, stand with your people, crown on your head, until the very end.</p>\n<p><em>Gameplay</em></p>\n<p>Kingdom is a 2D sidescrolling strategy/resource management hybrid with a minimalist feel wrapped in a beautiful, modern pixel art aesthetic. Play the role of a king or queen atop their horse and enter a procedurally generated realm primed to sustain a kingdom, then toss gold to peasants and turn them into your loyal subjects in order to make your kingdom flourish. Protect your domain at night from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown, and explore the nearby, mysterious forests to discover curious and cryptic artifacts to aid your kingdom.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-15T17:34:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e40/e40cc9d1957b0a0ed7e389834457b524.jpg", "website": "https://www.kingdomthegame.com/kingdom-classic/", "rating": 3.39, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 367, "owned": 5173, "beaten": 187, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 227, "playing": 14}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 559, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 559, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Noio", "Licorice"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raw Fury"], "esrb_rating": null}
