The theme for the jam was \"Locked.\"\u00a0 My idea for this game is that you are locked in a simulation of a security system testings its abilities. At the end of each level, you select an upgrade for the system.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the Jam was to learn something new in game development.\u00a0 My goal was to figure out a simple system of random level generation.\u00a0 While what I end up with wasn't my goal, but what is implemented works...I'll take it for now.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong> - A, D to move, Space to jump, Left click to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>A message from the creator\u00a0 - As with all my projects there are plans to improve and add more content. Please leave a comment or suggestion.\u00a0 There may be bugs, please let me know. As right now I know there is an issue with not going to the \"end scene\" up completion and character death.\u00a0</p><p>*Update Jan24th, 21* Fixed few know bugs related to above.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a28/a2829a92b3b0603dead24c2759833391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
