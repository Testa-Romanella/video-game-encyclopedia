Sadly we did not have enough time\u00a0to fully optimize the game for the webplayer. Lags should get better the longer you play.</strong></p>\n<p>Follovers combines the best mechanics of Frogger and Snake. How many follovers can you attract and how long can you keep them alive?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Controls</strong>:</strong><br/>Use W/A/S/D or the arrow keys to move.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong>\n<br/>- Go near idle follovers to collect them.<br/>- Your follovers are your lifes. When you die\u00a0the next follover in line replaces you.\r\n<br/>- You gain points each time you advance a row, depending on how many follovers you have and how high the row is.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerups:</strong><br/>Step on a powerup to activate it:<br/><em>Ghost</em> - The Ghost costume makes you invisible for a short time. Cars cant hit you. How spooky!<em>\n<br/>Savety Vest</em> - When you wear the Savety Vest cars will stop for you. How nice of them!</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong>\n<br/>- Johannes Kutsch (Ruhken)<br/>- Marcus Meiburg (Jar)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe6b87f055f68ee916d661f68bb1a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["_Jar", "Ruhken"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
