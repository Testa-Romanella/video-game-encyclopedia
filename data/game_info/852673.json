(Sorry for my English).\u00a0 This game is a simple puzzle with a lot of various levels. There are different locations and unique mechanics.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can solve it in 30 seconds.\u00a0Some doors switch when you look/don't look at a special block. Some doors are opened with breaking crystals. There are also usual buttons and blocks you need to move on them...\u00a0 Nevertheless, you need\u00a0 to collect all the coins from secret blocks and get to finish only. (But secret block may contain something that doesn't look like a coin)</p>\n<p>What about liminal spaces and really hard patterns?</p>\n<p>Also there will be convinient level editor. (Tutorial is on my YouTube channel)</p>\n<p>Isn't hard 2 is absolutely free. Everyone will be able to whatch it's code and make own version!</p>\n<p>P.S. There is a lot of bugs, because this project is too young.
