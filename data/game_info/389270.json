Hire and train fighters to defeat Kombat gym leaders and fend off the invading insurgent crocodile forces.</p>\n<p>In Kombat Club you start off by hiring the fighters you want to fight for you. From there, you will begin challenging the local Kombat Gyms to progress forward in the game. As of this release, there are 14 characters available to play and fight against but expect more to appear in the future.<br/><br/><br/>As many of you may know Kombat Club has been a passion project of mine for the better part of a year now. Like most young game developers, I did not expect to spend this long making this game. That being said, I hope you enjoy Kombat Club and be sure to leave me feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/1226ac8fb85939d0fbb91cb945ef137c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ant3ney"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
