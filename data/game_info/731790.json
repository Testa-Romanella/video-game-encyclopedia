(just remember to put down concrete slab foundations before placing your buildings, to avoid damage).</p>\n\n<p>Wind Traps generate electricity to power your buildings. Refinery's take raw Spice (mined by Harvesters), which are converted into credits, to allow you to build more! Take your units and explore your new terrain.</p>\n<p>But watch out, as you are not alone. There are two other foreign factions that will fight you for control of Dune. Not to mention the native lifeforms - such as Sandworms, which can swallow units whole!</p>\n<p>Units can be instructed to attack enemy units and may automatically retreat when outnumbered. Harvesters will automatically try to find the closest spice, but can also be told where to mine - they'll also automatically return to base for unloading when full.</p>\n<p>Grow your base, expand your building options as you go (more will unlock at later levels). Preserve your Construction Yard at all costs - you can't build another one!*<br/>*(unless you have\u00a0an MCV...)</p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/>(+feel free to share any cool pics/vids using #UnDUNE2 hashtag)</p>\r\nTIPS\r\n<ul><li>Improve radar quality by building a Radar Outpost<br/>(ensure sufficient power levels are maintained to keep operational)</li><li>Certain buildings require other buildings to be built before they will be available.</li><li>Other buildings and units will unlock at the later levels.</li><li>If you need credits\u00a0fast, you can send a\u00a0Harvester back to Refinery early.<br/>\n</li><li>Some units are only available to certain factions - such as\u00a0Harkonnen Devastator, Ordos Deviator, Atreides Sonic Tank.</li><li>Build a Repair Centre and units will\u00a0try to go directly to them get fixed without you having to tell them.</li><li>Build base foundations quickly by placing 4x4 Concrete Slabs (even if on uneven terrain)</li><li>Build a Carryall as soon as you can (via Hi-Tech Factory) - as they will pick-up/drop-off units (such as Harvesters and retreating units) MUCH faster.\u00a0</li><li>Trikes are fast and inexpensive - use them to scout enemy bases\u00a0<br/>(just make sure you're prepared for a fight once they know where you are!)\u00a0</li><li>Sandworms can't \"eat\" units if they are on land.</li><li>Spice Blooms (mounds) can be shot to release payloads of spice.</li></ul>\r\nCREDITS &amp;\u00a0THANKS\r\n<p>\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Code, PixelArt:\u00a0<br/><strong>- Paul Nicholas</strong>\u00a0- (@Liquidream) -\u00a0www.liquidream.co.uk</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfb6 Music &amp;\u00a0SFX:<br/><strong>- Chris Donnelly</strong>\u00a0- (@Gruber_Music) -\u00a0www.grubermusic.com</p>\r\nAdditionally:\r\n<ul><li>\ufe0f\ufe0f\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u00a0\"Dune Nights\" Cover Art by\u00a0<strong>Ahmad Alromeadheen</strong> (@AAlromeadheen)</li><li>\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Playtesting by <strong>Chris Donnelly</strong>, <strong>Dylan Bennett</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Maxwel</strong></li></ul>\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n<ul><li>Rotate Sprite\u00a0and Raycast 3D Title snippets\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Frederic Souchu</strong></li><li>PX9 Data Compression\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Zep</strong><br/>\n</li><li><strong>G</strong>ood\u00a0<strong>E</strong>nough Minifier\u00a0for Pico-8\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Paul Hammond</strong><br/>\n</li><li>picotool (luamin) by Dan Sanderson</li><li>Retrospecs\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>John Parker</strong></li><li>A*\u00a0Pathfinder by\u00a0<strong>Morgan McGuire</strong></li><li>Bitmasking example by<strong> Bigaston</strong></li><li>Dialog Text Flow w/ Coroutines by <strong>Dylan Bennett</strong></li><li>Palette-Maker by <strong>2DArray</strong></li><li>\"<em>UnDUNE II:\u00a0The Demaking of a Dynasty</em>\" name suggestion by <strong>Tom Hall</strong></li><li><strong>Westwood Studios</strong> for creating such an inspiring\u00a0classic game.</li></ul>\r\nCurrent Supporter Thanks:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><em>ThatTomHall,\u00a0Vitorio Miliano,\u00a0\u00a0Andrew Dicker,\u00a0 Kurt Klemm,\u00a0 Qristy Overton,\u00a0 Tobias V.
