{"id": 979056, "slug": "the-last-stop-2", "name": "The Last Stop", "name_original": "The Last Stop", "description": "\"The Last Stop\" is an immersive video game centered around a unique and suspenseful concept. In this game, players find themselves trapped in a single subway car, unable to leave. The gameplay revolves around the player's journey to reach the final stop as their only means of escape. However, the challenge lies in the fact that players can only see their surroundings when the train is moving between stations. Once the train stops, everything plunges into darkness, and upon the resumption of movement, players find themselves back in the same subway car. This cycle of visibility and darkness adds a mysterious and claustrophobic element to the game, where players must rely on memory, strategy, and quick decision-making to navigate through the unknown and reach their ultimate goal - The Last Stop.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T06:13:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b55dd47e6f4f278e894f07d6f5545e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeadArrow"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HeadArrow"], "esrb_rating": null}
