After that point, this project will cease getting regular updates and early access on the new project will begin prior to initial launch.</p>\n<p>You can read more about this reasoning about splitting the project into a prototype project and an official release project on my patreon post or my last Itch.io devlog entry.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae608e199b8805d6e362e7d9ac45eb7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Integer Man"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
