The theme of the jam was \"Stuck in the loop\", which I honestly disliked. However, after a while of brainstorming, I came up with a simple thought: \"What if the goal is\u00a0<em>not to get out of the loop</em>, but rather\u00a0<em>get stuck in it instead?</em>\"<br/>And so, the premise of a loopy town that has robots functioning as blood in it was born. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse clicks to choose and place buildings in the vicinity of any road.</p>\n<p>The robots will take care of the rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>The year is 2127.</p>\n<p>Facing a severe lack of resources, Humanity sends a remote excavation mission to a distant world filled with minerals. Since it's extremely hard to support an actual human, the autonomous robots are going to do all the work instead.</p>\n<p>There's only one issue - the droids have to keep moving. All. The. Time. Otherwise, they will die and the circuit will break. Which leads to a very special kind of cyclic structure for the cities those robots will build.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>So, guess what's the good news here?</p>\n<p>You are assigned to be the Architect, the scheming leader of the droids in question! Congrats!</p>\n<p>Will they be able to handle it or will they all perish into oblivion getting stuck in the loop? It's only yours to decide!</p>\n<p>The fate of all humans is in your hands!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9ad68faa5a6765d260d09616d783a15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Nebulate.me"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
