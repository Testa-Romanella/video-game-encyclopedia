This game is a deep commentary on social media. Single-player or local couch co-op, up to 4 players.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Made in &lt;24 hours for #1ClassJam, a game jam in which all the game code must be contained in 1 class (no structs or subclasses). So the code for this is gonna be ugly: here. The performance of this game may be dependent on your machine's CPU/GPU as there is plenty of physics going on.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Collect the most hearts. Stay on top of the crowd. Don't fall onto the ground for too long - you'll die and then respawn in a few seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> You control the left and right wings of your bird. Flap one wing to rotate. Flap both wings together to push forward. The more rapidly you flap, the more rapidly you move.<br/></p>\r\nActionCommandPlayer 1 Keys<br/>Left Arrow and Right Arrow<br/>Player 2 Keys<br/>A and D keys<br/>Player 3 Keys<br/>N and M keys<br/>Player 4 Keys<br/>9 and 0 keys<br/>QuitEscape key<br/>\n<p><strong>Tip 1:\u00a0</strong>Go to the edge the crowd to steer it in that direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> If you fall off the crowd, flap like crazy to try to get back onto it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>: Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, Audacity<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Attributions:</strong><br/>Music: Tafi Maradi no voice by Kevin Macleod (Incompetech.com) (CC-BY).
