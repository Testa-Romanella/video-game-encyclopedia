{"id": 459000, "slug": "home-movie", "name": "Home Movie", "name_original": "Home Movie", "description": "<p>Home Movie is an interactive new media documentary that uses 3D animation, documentary film, as well as real-time game mechanics to rebuild and explore disappearing neighborhoods from my home in the westside of Detroit. The project draws on collective memory (i.e., interviews, dialogues with family and other members of my close community, as well as personal and archival footage) to rebuild my forgotten neighborhoods within Detroit.</p>\n<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>\n<p>This game\u00a0offers a sort of classic controller system similar to most computer games!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here we use the keyboard and mouse to move, as well as look around each space. Move the mouse/trackpad to look in any direction - left, right, up, or down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the up and down arrow keys or the W and S keys to move forward or backward - the left and right arrow to rotate/strafe - or A and D keys to rotate/strafe</p>\n<p>When wandering around each neighborhood you\u2019ll probably notice pillars of light. They usually represent a memory! It's helpful to collect them in order to move forward, and on to another neighborhood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time you collect a memory they are stored, and archived in the player menu. Here you can review, and most importantly remember each space by pressing \"esc\" on your keyboard!</p>\n<p>Enjoy, and I hope to see you around!</p>\n<p>Please watch for addition game directions and information!</p>\n<p><strong>Fundraiser\u00a0Information:</strong></p>\n<p>All\u00a0purchases of <em>Home Movie</em>\u00a0will go to BLM Chicago, Chicago Community Bond Fund, ChiCAT, and Brave Space Alliance.
