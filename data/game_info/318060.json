{"id": 318060, "slug": "blastopia-deluxe", "name": "Blastopia DeluXe", "name_original": "Blastopia DeluXe", "description": "<p>Back in the autumn of 2018. Blastopia was born. It was a fast-paced horizontal scrolling blaster, which accompanied the Assemble It machine code tutorial, based on scrolling.<br/><br/>A few months later, BLASTOPIA is back. A horizontal scrolling blaster, featuring fresh new levels, new enemies, stunning graphics, and most importantly of them all - FITS THE 16KB CARTRIDGE. The game was transformed to fit the category, in order to compete for the RGCD 16KB cartridge compo.</p>\n<p>It is the year 2092. Sightings of an alien ship was discovered. Scientists set their communication satellites to welcome the alien kind and offered to trade with the aliens. Unfortunately,\u00a0 humans and aliens didn't understand each other, so the aliens hovered down and captured camels from zoos and farms around the world. Then they fled into different planets. Luckily, scientists were watching. Unfortunately, you have been chosen by the Inter Space Rescue (ISR) authority to set off into deep space and enter each of the 8 alien planets on a rescue and destroy mission.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Your mission is to send your mega power blaster ship, Blaastopia and try to destroy the planets. I order to do this, you must battle against a complete fleet of assorted aliens. Each alien can be destroyed with one hit of your lasers. The faster aliens shot will result in more points for you.\u00a0 For every complete fleet of aliens hit, a camel will appear and start falling. Pick the camel up, and you will add one camel to the quota. If you fail rescue it,\u00a0 you still can keep on shooting the fleet of aliens. <br/></p>\n<p>Once you have rescued all of the camels you required, you will be prompted to make a safe landing. After you successfully land on to the landing pad,. You will\u00a0 destroy the alien world and then be awarded a bonus, according to your shield count. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Do not crash into any aliens or scrolling background - otherwise you could end up draining your shield quickly. Once the shield is zeroed, your ship will self-destruct. You will only have 3 lives. Bonus lives will be awarded for every level that has been completed. You will need those, as each stage will eventually become more tougher and possibly insane.</p>\n<p>Can you rescue enough camels, land safely and destroy all of the alien planets or will death become a fate for you?</p>\n<p><strong>*** CREDITS ***<br/></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Programming, sound effects and music by<br/><strong>RICHARD BAYLISS<br/><br/></strong>Exomizer level de-compression source by<br/><strong>MAGNUS LIND<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Graphics and design by <br/><strong>SAUL CROSS<br/><br/></strong>16KB cartridge Framework by<br/></p>\n<p><strong>(Screen shots on this page are the original Blastopia - New screen shots will appear once ready and implemented into the game).<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc6/bc658ad53348cfded9efcc854a93830f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
