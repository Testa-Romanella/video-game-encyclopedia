{"id": 673905, "slug": "martian-crasher", "name": "Martian Crasher", "name_original": "Martian Crasher", "description": "<p>You've seen Lunar Landers before, but have you ever borne witness to a Martian Crasher?<br/><br/>Your challenge is to descend to the Martian surface- in one piece if possible. But beware, you only have <strong><em>20 seconds</em></strong> of fuel in the tank! If you run out, you'll be <strong><em>out of control</em></strong>, and have to sit back and watch the disaster play out on its own!<br/><br/>The controls, like any good lander simulation, are made to be as difficult to master as possible. You can trigger maneuvering thrusters, and you can trigger elevator thrusters. Once triggered, it will take a moment for them to reach full thrust, and while they are thrusting they are turning fuel into momentum. They also take a moment to shut off, so be careful with where you're spending your limited fuel!</p>\n<p>It is possible to land safely! The details have been tweaked to make it difficult but not impossible. It is also not required of you to land safely, feel free to play to the title of the game ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T09:51:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95a7eefa89c6afb642b9755f786f3440.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ferociousfeind"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
