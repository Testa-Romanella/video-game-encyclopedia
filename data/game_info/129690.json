The events come in one of four different types, Off-Road Races, Road Races, Collector Races (where all the competitors try to locate and collect the most randomly placed icons scattered around the map), and Jam Races (where opposing vehicles rush against each other to randomly appearing checkpoint gates). Winning or placing in these events earns the player money which can then be spent on entry fees to other events and also can be used to purchase new vehicles.There are several vehicles to choose from such as the Land Raider and Wrecker and each vehicle comes with four different paint jobs options, Completing events in the Career Mode unlocks vehicles, map terrain types, and race types for use in Quick Race mode. In Quick Race mode, players are free to pick a map, race type, and vehicle of their choosing. It also introduces a Free Roam mode where the player can just drive around in a non competitive format.</p>\n<p>SEE LESS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83f1890301fa908ae8ca827b075c4aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["dubodelov"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
