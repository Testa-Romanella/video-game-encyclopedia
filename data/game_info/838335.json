However, in Kredon, there\u2019s only one thing everyone talks about: ETERNUM\u2014the virtual, hyper-reality MMORPG game released a few years ago that revolutionized the world of technology.<br />\nWith a neural implant that recreates the five senses, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.<br />\nThousands of servers form the network of Eternum: from colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds to foggy sci-fi cities, no world is beyond reach.<br />\nNevertheless, looking beyond the surface, there&#39;s a darker side to this pretty facade: black markets, torture, rape, illegal content trafficking, unlawful assemblies, data theft\u2026 Eternum follows the rules of no man.<br />\nFor some reason, governments turn a blind eye to this; there\u2019s no regulation and no control. Some say it\u2019s because the game is highly addictive, some say it\u2019s because the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power have been bribed, and others say\u2026 there\u2019s something else going on.<br />\nAnd you? What\u2019s your role in this story?<br />\nWell... That\u2019s up to you now.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-26T23:04:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/20320f29f6c8cb51b24355b1a38ecc46.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/onceinalifetime", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
