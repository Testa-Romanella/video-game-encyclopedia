I have implemented some major and some minor changes, Hope you like it !!!</p>\n<p>Major changes:</p>\n<p>1. Added 2 new engaging levels, one of which (level 3) has a different playstyle compared to the previous ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Added a cutscene between levels 2 and 3, which explains the lore behind the change in playstyle. It is made using the animator and timeline tools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Added a new script that inherits from the pickup script and adds an additional 10 points to the score instead of 1. I added this script to a new sprite (provided in the assets)\u00a0and made it into a prefab.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Minor changes:</p>\n<p>1. Changed the font of the whole project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Changed the levels page in the main menu\u00a0to reflect changes to the levels and added content to the instructions and credits pages.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Daksh Mehta</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005da54e4370ae607387e67c71a61682.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["mehtadak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
