The object is for Agenesia, who you play, to make it to work and not get fired. As you will soon see, it's... more complicated than that.</p><p>It's a point and click adventure combining multiple graphics styles and storytelling elements.</p><p>I will be expanding this game with more music, quest arcs and endings over the next few weeks, and will then make the game available for download. If you have input into things you'd like to see happen in the game, please feel free to suggest in the comments (while also being courteous about spoilers, of course).</p><p>This project was financed by the Interactive Fiction Fund July 2015 (http://iffund.net/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/69300469a64f88e0139ee5298fadc4fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rani Baker"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
