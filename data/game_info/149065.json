This page exists so that those people can still manually snag a copy of the latest builds so they don't miss out!</p>\n<p>Here's what's in this month's package:</p>\n<li><strong>Solar Scope 0.1.3</strong></li><li><strong>Tale of Rin 0.1.0</strong></li><li><strong>Tiki Cave Adventure 1.0.0</strong></li><p>Also check out my website Lombergames.com for more info!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/001fac67ab51e9e295e2dcc12773d567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DizzyDize"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
