The map UI for the controller isn't tuned properly, end game conditions aren't implemented,\u00a0and monster spawning is questionable.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:</p>\n<p>\u00a0In an abandoned laboratory, you find yourself stranded with a friend. Your communication is limited to walkie talkies and a shitty intercom. Unfortunately, the laboratory is less abandoned than initially anticipated.</p>\n<p>The game features two roles:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The\u00a0Controller: has access to a map and must help the explorer navigate the lab</p>\n<p>The Explorer:\u00a0\u00a0must navigate the lab in search of the exit, while avoiding some...unfinished lab experiments...that may or may not want your company...</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Controller: Click the live map to open an enlarged display that highlights certain locations on the map when living objects occupy them.</p>\n<p>Explorer: Use w, a, s, d (I believe the arrow keys work too but that hasn't been tested) to navigate the scene. The compass rose shows your orientation.</p>\n<p>Hold v to use a walkie talkie. This has a\u00a0limited use time.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Calvin Nguyen - Design, Level Art</p>\n<p>Caleb Kim - UI\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kenzie MacDougal - Monster Art &amp; Programming</p>\n<p>Ming Zhu - Network\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yun Tsai - Level Design &amp; Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T04:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/382/382405f25671d1970d42864bc7b7b125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Do3naut", "Kenzie MacDougal"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
