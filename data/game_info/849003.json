Basically, you control two characters at once, which are on both sides of the screen. Each side is a little different, however the main goal is to get to the end of the level, by entering the hovering portal with the character on the left.</p>\n<p>The game is just a small project, although i may turn it into a full comercial release if many people will be interested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I really seek feedback more than donations, ore anything else! Please tell me what do you think about the game and the concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T01:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e93ec81cfd28f4a1b43aaf6096d94d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emmet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
