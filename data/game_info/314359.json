Close your door, lock your latch, lest your life and soul he will snatch.<br/></p>\n<p>YOU are the Kindercatch and your life comes at a cost\u2026 the cost of innocence. In order to keep the bargain for your dark soul, you must catch and dispatch as many little souls as possible. However, it may not be as easy as you would think, they can be\u2026 sneaky.</p>\n<p>How To Play: A/D or Arrow Keys to move left/right, W or Up Arrow to float, and Space to Slash.
