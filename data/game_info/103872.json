Or at least that's what her parents claim. Really the school's a bit on the shady side. The dress code requires everyone, even the teachers, to wear a mask at all times. All the people seem to be cheery enough, but it's almost as though they're afraid to feel any other way... Nonetheless, Sakura's got to at least make it through a month of independence, so she might as well make some friends while she's at it.</p><p>\"The game contains 190 dialogue blocks, containing 3,872 words and 20,698</p><p>characters, for an average of 20.4 words and 109 characters per block.</p><p>The game contains 11 menus, 16 images, and 12 screens.\"</p><p>and, in case you were wondering, 6 different endings.</p><p>Currently made with creative commons backgrounds and creative commons sprites for one of the character (there's a text doc in the file if you'd like to know from hence they came), I would hopefully like to redo this game in the future with the other paths I planned and my own artwork (hopefully better than what I have for Umeko).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/152d65656940b9fb354be6ec0e12d167.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["PsychopathiCat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
