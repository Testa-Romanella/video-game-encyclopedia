You select an Atom with space-bar and move it with the Cursor keys. But if you move an Atom it moves so long until it hit another tile or the wall. So you must wait, you need a real strategy.</p>\n<p>In this Version is no time-limit, you have endless time to think.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also great Music by Boris Grabule.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/109/1094850b8b090d7c26ea662dc7415d41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bardon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
