The course *should* only take 10 minutes to beat, but I feel like it might take a bit longer than that...</p>\r\nA test of perseverance\u00a0\r\n<p>The game has NO checkpoints, so if you fall down, there's no easy way to get back up! The player has very low friction and no air control, so make sure to calculate your jumps. I do recommend taking regular breaks however, I don't want any smashed keyboards on my hands!</p>\r\nShow off your skills!\r\n<p>I'd love to see your reactions to the game! Record and upload your playthroughs and times, I'll be very proud of anyone who can beat the game!</p>\r\nExtra content?\r\n<p>If the game becomes popular, I'll consider a steam release with extra content!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T14:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c8801704182e6450fce523eace5f267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spacepiano Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
