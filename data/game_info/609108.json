Next to all the A-listers in Smash, he's an absolute nobody! This is true\u00a0until he discovers a time travel weapon which allow him to conquer the gaming world one console generation at a time.</p>\n<p>Find yourself rolling in nine different levels where you go head to head with\u00a0some of gaming's largest icons, attempting to tarnish their likeness.</p>\n<p>King K Roller 2 is primarily a 3D platformer, sprinkled with several aspects from the collect-a-thon and puzzle genres too.</p>\n<p>The game offers over 20 hours of content for new players, as it is extremely hard, but ultimately very satisfying to complete. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/6193fcf0f3aa4e7c2347bd8b271a0aea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["booll5"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
