Like the previously endorsed game, European Club Soccer focus on European competitions, but with only on the European Champions Cup, which can be explained by the lower capacity of the console and the lack of differences between competitions other than the number of teams. If the player won the Champions Cup, the ending credits will only appear if the player beats a South American team in the Intercontinental Cup. The game was a bestseller in the UK charts for three months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:35:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c27d9a3ac2c04c6af6e9910a224ac425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Krisalis Software", "GAME ARTS"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Games", "Shogakukan"], "esrb_rating": null}
