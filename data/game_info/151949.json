The second was transforming the cameras to project a true\u00a0view of the portal exit for all relevant directions that portal may face (see the portal screenshots.)\u00a0Finally, Adaszewski's work was expanded to support up to 4 simultaneous portal pairs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14a3f4771c58f481622648d0d7422849.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonapulse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
