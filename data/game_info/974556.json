{"id": 974556, "slug": "lighark", "name": "Lighark", "name_original": "Lighark", "description": "<strong>Lighark</strong> is a top-down action-adventure game. The secluded protagonist  and their family are brutally murdered, but a man known as the  \"Scavenger\" clones the protagonist's body and resurrects him. In order  to seek revenge, the protagonist embarks on an adventure, piloting a  spaceship and traveling between various wondrous planets. He collect  the most important Yin and Yang crystals in the galaxy to strengthen his own body, all in order to slay the Emperor of the Holy Light  Empire, who massacred their entire family. Little do they know, they are actually getting entangled in a larger conspiracy.<h3>Multiple Attack Methods</h3><br/>The protagonist's unique physique allows him to merge Yin and Yang  energies to create a new golden energy. This golden energy can further  transform into various elements with different functions. By combining  these elements and energy projection methods, the protagonist can obtain different attack methods.<br/><h3>Balancing between multiple factions</h3><br/>In this galaxy, there are three major factions: local creatures, the  Holy Light Empire, and the Shadow Alliance. The protagonist does not  belong to any of these factions, and different factions can attack each other. Cleverly utilizing the conflicts between factions can enhance the protagonist's survival capabilities on various planets.<h3>Mental control enemies</h3><br/>When the protagonist is injured, the golden  energy dropped will be mistakenly absorbed by other creatures as  Yin-Yang energy. When the golden energy exceeds the creature's own  energy, it will be controlled. Controlling a group of creatures to fight together can increase the protagonist's survival rate.<h3>Diverse Planets</h3><br/>The galaxy contains over 20 explorable planets, roughly divided into  the galaxy's edge, the Holy Light Empire-controlled area, the Shadow  Empire-controlled area, and the war zone. The difficulty varies  significantly in different regions. Each planet has its own  characteristics, such as different local creatures, terrains, and  special natural phenomena.<br/><h3>Rich Upgrade Options</h3><br/>Attack methods and various parameters of the character can be  upgraded using Yin and Yang crystals obtained in levels. These upgrades  include movement speed, HP, damage, range, cooldown, bullet quantity, revenge rate, and more, providing a wide range of possibilities. Players can choose their own direction of enhancement.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T04:46:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd8d672b3106a3749ae2f0128ef51dd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cc indie game"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["cc indie game"], "esrb_rating": null}
