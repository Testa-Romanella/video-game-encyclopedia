One day, he awoke in a peculiar world of paper, cardboard lining the walls and strange flowers sprouting from its grain. In front of him lurked a long path down into darkness. It was there he found himself applying his practiced locksmithing skills as he found strange locks scattered throughout the chambers. Except, he quickly realized that these were no ordinary locks. These were locks of the Dungeon of Paper.</p>\n<p>Here's our submission to Ludum Dare 48! It was created in Unity and all models, sprites, animations, and set design were created by me (Wintergatn)! DrWatts worked on the programming end to implement the main mechanic of the game where you move boxes that correspond with locks. As for the gameplay, what we have created is more of a proof of concept than fully-developed levels, as we would have liked to create more interesting objects with properties that would allow for more complex puzzles. (Note:\u00a0we took out the doors for the second two puzzles because they were not finished in time! Feel free to just walk through!) We hope you enjoy, thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b436496dff078cd40656a340ce60a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wintergatn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
