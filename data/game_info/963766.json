Sharing the same apartment, though destined never to meet, they must work together to uncover the mystery shrouding both their existences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Frank is the super of a run-down apartment block in Oriole City, worried he is losing his mind and what little remains of his connection to the world around him. Drake is allergic to sunlight and operates by night. Their split existence means they must communicate via sticky notes left around the apartment. Despite this separation, they must forge a relationship, uncover the truth and survive.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is set in Oriole City, a richly detailed and beautifully illustrated setting, with remarkable characters, and secrets to unearth. Frank and Drake must explore these surroundings, solve puzzles and discover clues that will help them find the answers they desperately seek, to their respective troubled pasts. Though they must work separately, their fates are intertwined and depend on the trust and friendship they forge together. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The mystery unfolds via a branching narrative, where the choices you make will have a profound impact on the events both protagonists experience. Multiple playthroughs will be rewarded with the discovery of new perspectives on the story, as well as unique puzzles and mini-games. Which path will you choose? Will you discover all the secrets hidden in the world?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Frank and Drake employs a beautiful graphical style that represents the unnerving and dreamlike existence that both characters feel with the world around them. The rotoscoping style is a painstaking process of hand drawing frames over filmed footage. The uncanny result reflects Frank and Drake\u2019s realities: two extraordinary characters trying to blend into an ordinary world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T06:37:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf0bc9d9121aa6b3d1df92da05281e1c.jpg", "website": "https://chorusworldwide.com/frank-and-drake/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Appnormals Team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chorus Worldwide Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
