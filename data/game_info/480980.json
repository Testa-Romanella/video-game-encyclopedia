{"id": 480980, "slug": "zena", "name": "Zena", "name_original": "Zena", "description": "<p>My entry to LOWREZJAM 2020.</p>\n<p>In a post apocalyptic world, Zena must venture into the old mines to recover a new energy source - the \"crystals\". The mines are still inhabited by the machines that once worked to harness the energy but now remain as protcetors of a lost world.</p>\n<p>Zena must collect 5 crystals and return to the entrance by ecxploring 16 flip-screen style areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Keyboard - arrow keys to move left/right/look up/down. Z shoot, X jump.</li><li>Onscreen - left side of screen to move/look up/down, top right shoot, bottom right jump.</li></ol>\n<p>Zena has 3 lives and 3 arrows - both can be replenished through pickups.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to do so much more for this game but simply ran out of time. I wanted more of a metroidy exploration feel, along with powerups. I was going to go with 64 screens and 12 crystals to pickup - each set of 4 enabling a powerup and allowing different weapons - lasers, bombs etc. Also wanted to add secret areas, different enemies, savepoints and a proper narrative. After the jam I'll be looking at doing this as an update or maybe a HD remake.</p>\n<p>A few things\u00a0I couldn't work out in time:</p>\n<ul><li>This will look blurry on Microsoft browsers (maybe not Edgium or whatever it is) - I've given up on them...</li><li>No fullscreen - my mobile controls seem to borg keyboards on linux with fullscreen. Probably my fault and probably fixable but for now just removed.</li></ul>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Phaser JS (https://phaser.io/)</li><li>Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org/)</li><li>Pixaki (https://rizer.co/pixaki/)</li><li>Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/)</li><li>Manjaro (https://manjaro.org/)</li><li>VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)</li><li>Pocket Operator - PO-20 Arcade (https://teenage.engineering/products/po)</li><li>Nipple JS for the onscreen controls (https://yoannmoi.net/nipplejs/)</li><li>DB32 palette (https://lospec.com/palette-list/dawnbringer-32)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee7b20377b6794cf29c93aaf3a0eb8fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dancramp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
