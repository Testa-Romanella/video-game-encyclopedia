You pass the ball to each other as the ball takes the color of the curve it touches when a goal is scored the point is given according to the ball's color. So if a goal is scored with the ball being blue you get a point but if the goal is scored with the ball being green enemy gets the point...<br/><br/>Well, we also have SUPERPOWERS to help you (or your enemy) out:<br/><br/>1-Slow: Slows down the player who touched the ball last.<br/>2-Speed: It's like slow, but much quicker.<br/>3-Reverse: This superpower effects all two players, when a player touches the ball it takes the color of its opponent. (Can be VERY confusing)<br/>4-Frozen: When this \"superpower\" is taken the player who took it is trapped in a parallel universe for some time... (so player's puck cannot move) (yes it affects the one who took it)<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>-Complete unique achievements gain more XP and level up on Google Play!<br/>-Compete for becoming the BEST in the world with your scores.<br/>-Benefit \"Wheelie\" in order to beat any kind of bot!\u00a0<br/>-Try with your friends, play MULTIPLAYER!<br/><br/>Update Notes:<br/>-Debugs<br/>-The \"Wheelie\"<br/>-Credits?<br/>-Achievements<br/><br/>Don't forget to send your feedback!<br/>Support us, e-mail us :)<br/><br/><br/>Programmed by: Deniz Karakay<br/>Visualized &amp; Designed by: Bora Akdo\u011fan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703575beab8de26dc830e6b41d7da770.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeKAL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
