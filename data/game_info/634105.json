It was made within one week for the Game Dev Unlocked's 2nd game jam with the theme \"Lost &amp; Found\".</p>\n<p>Play as Gary who is looking for his lost daughter Meryl in Noisy Town.<br/></p>\n<p>It's an homage to one of the pillars of survival horror. I will keep working on the game after the jam to give it some mechanics and learn more about Unity.</p>\n<p>There's no sound at the very beginning of the game. So don't worry or mess with your volume. Also, you need to hit ALT+F4 to quit the game once you found Meryl, since there's no end screen triggered, yet.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Right now there are no interactions, just walking.<br/></p>\n<p>WASD for movement<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse for camera</p>\n<p>Better only try W for forward and camera with mouse<br/></p>\n<p>ALT+F4 to get the fuck out again when you've found Meryl<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/127ff6d07f77f171f083ed237067f4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MrSupertash"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
