In order to recreate the experience, we incorporated the Doppelg\u00e4nger theme by showcasing how people's mental states can alter their perceptions of reality. The player goes through the anxiety-inducing lifestyle of having daily intrusive thoughts which are represented through aggravating sounds. The only way to relieve such thoughts is to arrange objects in a neat manner. Each correctly placed item gradually reduces the noise giving the player enough relief to leave the house for the day and sleep for the night.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>CONTROLS:</em></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>E - Arrange</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9abb2a9bc560d419fc402ad8817733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Say.say9", "michablue", "Lex Fezler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
