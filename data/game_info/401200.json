Now with <strong>NO ads</strong> and<strong> NO microtransactions</strong>!! Buy once and play all content forever, including new expansions as they get added.<br/><br/>An incremental game where you place cards strategically on a grid to generate resources, and you spend those resources to purchase booster packs containing new cards.<br/><br/>Once you have enough resources, unlock the next expansion. Each expansion is its own little idle game that adds new mechanics and new cards to the mix, ensuring the game never gets stale. Later expansions change the formula even more, featuring RPG-like battle mechanics.<br/><br/>You can carry your progress over to this version from the Kongregate version by clicking the gear icon in the top-right corner of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T03:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969db577cd99237d27c433b0f7fb8dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fordesoft"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
