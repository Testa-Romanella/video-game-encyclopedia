The game revolves around a candleholder\u00a0which needs to escape the dungeon while keeping it's candle burning. This is my first attempt on developing a puzzle game, so forgive me if the levels\u00a0lack depth or are too simple.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022<strong>How is it \"less or more\"?</strong>\u2022<br/>The less candle wax you have, the more obstacle\u00a0 is present.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022<strong>\u00a0Credits \u2022<br/></strong>Everything is made by me.\u00a0<br/>Here are the tools that I used:<br/>Art - <strong>Aseprite<br/></strong>\u00a0Game\u00a0Engine -<strong> Unity 3D<br/></strong>\u00a0Sound Effects - <strong>BFXR<br/></strong>\u00a0Music -<strong>\u00a0BoscaCeoil</strong></p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to create more levels. To combat this, I decided to make the final level have 2 endings. One for casual play and another for extra challenge. The easy one can be accessed by just hitting all the switches/pressure plates. The harder one can only be accessed by covering the entire level with wax.</p>\r\nThank you for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:26:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/4434643e8bde398614d277bd60ba70bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["daniekkkk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
