But when circumstances get grim, tough decisions have to be made! Can you keep the fragile bonds of friendship in tact and hold on to those you need to survive?<br/></p><p><strong>The Monster in Me</strong> is a choice-consequence game set in a post-apocalyptic world. It explores the relationship between three friends as they are thrown into stressful situations that test their friendship. As well as branching content the game remembers each decision you make and has multiple endings based on them.
