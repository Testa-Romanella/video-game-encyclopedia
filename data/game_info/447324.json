I thought it was a dream, but everything was so</p>\n<p>\u00a0real that I had goosebumps. I decided to look around but there was darkness around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0After about 20 minutes, I saw something that looked like a tower or a large rectangular stone, I tried to jump on it, and a miracle happened!\u00a0 I jumped very high, like as high as the moon, and moved on...</p>\n<p>\u00a0Some kind of demon is running at me, very bright!\u00a0 He blinded me in this darkness, but I pulled out a sword and stuck it right in its head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Then I met a couple more of these creatures as well as a sorcerer!</p>\n<p>\u00a0He created some sort of fireball, and it flew right at me, I had no choice but to beat them back with a sword!\u00a0 And it worked... The ball flew into the sorcerer</p>\n<p>\u00a0and it exploded!</p>\n<p>\u00a02 weeks have passed...</p>\n<p>\u00a0I am very scared and cold, but I will not stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a03 weeks passed ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0Flying creatures attacked me!\u00a0 One bit me, but the wound is almost healed, I must go further.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/017921603b1ae5f6d2486b3199ab32a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["David Tsarskykh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
