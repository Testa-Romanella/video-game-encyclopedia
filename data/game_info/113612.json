As part of the company's standard training for new hires, you'll be getting acquainted with our proprietary circuit prototyping software through a series of challenging exercises.<br/></p>\n<p>To create circuits with the software, click and drag parts from the shelf on the right side of the screen onto the grid. Drag a part outside of the grid to remove it. Create wires by clicking and dragging anywhere on the grid. Remove wires with right-click.</p>\n<p>The Parts Manual has information on every part available to you. You can open it by clicking the \"Manual\" button in the corner. If you're unsure what something does, consult the Manual.</p>\n<p>For information on the current puzzle, consult the Problem Specification. You can open it at any time by clicking the \"Spec\" button.</p>\n<p>When you think you've solved a puzzle, click the \"Test\" button to continue on the the next problem.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. testing the circuit saves your progress. If you're paranoid about save states like I am, this should put your mind at ease.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/5265f695566f856101bef5a0417d2503.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["stuntddude"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
