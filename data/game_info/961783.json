Once you were unlucky enough to fall from your reality into their otherworldly world. Such accidents sometimes happen and now it has happened to you. From now on you have only one job - to survive and find your way out! Remember, each level of Backrooms is dangerous in its own way and you will constantly have to adapt to new conditions. <br/><br/><strong>This game is a classic first-person indie horror game.</strong> In the menu you can choose from eight available levels. On each level you have only one goal: to find a way out. You have no weapons, you are always defenseless against the inhabitants of Backrooms and if you encounter them, escape is your only chance to survive. As you explore the different levels, you will encounter different dangers. For example, the level \"The Lobby\" is a big labyrinth in which it is easy to get lost, and the level \"Habitable Zone\" is inhabited by an entity that is a threat and appears only in the dark.<br/><br/>List of levels:<br/>Explore hallways and rooms of the most incredible shapes and sizes. You will be able to visit 8 levels of Backrooms, including: The Lobby, Habitable Zone, Pipe Dreams, Fun, Sublimity, The Windows, Level !, The End.
