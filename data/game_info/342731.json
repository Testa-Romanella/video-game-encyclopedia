It's to be an in and out job. Leave\u00a0no evidence, which means no killing, but feel free to stun guards to your heart's content. Also the guards seem to be aliens?!\u00a0Avoid raising the alarm but if you do slip up then zap the security monitors to quiet things down again. If things get too hot, we'll pull you out. Any questions? Good luck agent Spark.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys</p>\n<p>z to jump</p>\n<p>x to zap</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa1/fa1ff52606fdb95a471dda23b5de15f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Introspection Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
