Players need twitch reflexes and precise aiming skills, but Grabity also rewards tactical thinkers who can outmaneuver and outwit opponents in this intense, chaotic tango of death. Jostling for position in a contest of aerial agility, players must turn gravity to their advantage, predicting the trajectories of both projectiles and rival players to secure a brutal hit while snatching their next crate in midair: lobbing objects while blocking attacks, m\u00eal\u00e9e ebbing and flowing in an elastic \u2018footsie battle\u2019 style.<br/><br/>It all makes for a frenetic, fast-paced game in which the arena evolves kinetically as players smash, grab and loot their surroundings \u2013 dashing for pickups, hovering momentarily to nail the perfect trajectory and squabbling over the last of the environmental ammo. Intuitive twin-stick controls provide a fluid experience that\u2019s simple to learn but hard to master.Features<br/><ul><li><strong>2-4 person local multiplayer</strong> for maximum couch trash-talk<br/></li><li><strong>Intuitive twin-stick controls</strong> for a fluid play experience that\u2019s simple to learn but hard to master<br/></li><li><strong>Side-on 2.5D gameplay</strong>, fully rendered in 3D with real-time lighting and physics<br/></li><li><strong>Special items and pickups</strong> such as explosive canisters and EMP grenades add spice to the core gameplay<br/></li><li><strong>Custom game modes</strong> such as Low Gravity, King of the Crate and Juggernaut<br/></li><li><strong>Choose from several Arenas</strong>, each hosting a unique set of tactical choices</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19a9235037868890cbb3e45398892bdd.jpg", "website": "https://www.teamninjathumbs.com/grabity/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 99}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Ninja Thumbs"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Ninja Thumbs"], "esrb_rating": null}
