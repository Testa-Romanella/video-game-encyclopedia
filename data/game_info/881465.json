Blast the zoids, cleanse the Tau. <br/></p>\n<p>For one or two players on Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi and, ugh, web browser.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Play with keyboard or game controller. Most game controllers should work, even in the browser version.\u00a0 Use your game controller's D-pad rather than the joystick.</p>\n\n<p>Two game controllers are a must for two player mode. Toggle two-player mode at the title screen by hitting any button on controller 2.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tau 0 introduces you to the controls. Until you  beat Tau 2, Tau 0 is mandatory. Return to Tau 0 at any time by selecting \"Practice\" difficulty. <br/></p>\n<p>In the browser version above, treat yourself to fullscreen (button at the bottom right of the embed).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>Like any good arcade game, Zaag forces you to dodge and shoot your way out of each level. But be careful, your gun has an initial charge time and your teleporter needs to recharge after use.<br/></p>\n<p>Extra lives have been replaced with \"spares.\" Each level refreshes your spares count, so you always have the same number of tries to complete a level. Never give up just because you've had a bad start!<br/></p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Zaag is created by designer Casey Labrack, influenced by <em>Omega Zone</em>, <em>Geometry Wars</em>, and, of course, <em>Asteroids.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0658963ec79293629296de9f5a1c13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux"], "developers": ["Casey Labrack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
