Blast away at enemy ships and try to save the planet.<br/><br/>VectorWars - How We Got Here<br/>It has been over 800 years since we left the planet earth behind.  Isolated, and lost, we've clustered around our space stations like insects.<br/><br/>In 2842, it finally happened.  Aliens attacked, and we were forced to defend ourselves.<br/><br/>In this space shooter, you play as Andy, a reluctant asteroid miner that must defend humanity against the alien invasion!  Relying on advice from your sidekick, and orders from your commander, it is up to you to tackle the aliens head on!<br/><br/>History of the Game<br/>VectorWars was a low definition, old school arcade game we created for mobile many years ago.  During our live coding streams, we showed how you can rework and recreate old mobile games for high definition, modern VR systems!  We recreated and restructured our game to take full advantage of everything VR!<br/><br/>Check out the discussions for more information on our mobile journey into VectorWars, and to find information on our live coding sessions (where we did a series of live sessions to create this game in VR!).<br/><br/><ul><li> 11 Achievements<br/></li><li> 22 Upgrades<br/></li><li> Tons of enemies<br/></li><li> Multiple ships to choose from<br/></li><li> 1 snarky sidekick</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cd9ef1f476653038bbebe68044a7fc6.jpg", "website": "http://www.redironlabs.com/vectorwars", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Iron Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Iron Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
