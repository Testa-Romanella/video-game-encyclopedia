{"id": 452502, "slug": "twin-sticks", "name": "Twin Sticks", "name_original": "Twin Sticks", "description": "<p>Small arcade musical game based on your music. You goal is to destroy notes that appear on each side of the screen using the sticks of the controller and the buttons/triggers.</p>\n<p>You can customize your music difficulty with 4 options for spawn rate and note speed and you also have access to 3 different modifers that affect the notes and the game difficulty overall. Each option will increase your score with a multiplier (x1/x2/x3/x4).</p>\n<p>This isn't really a rhythm game as the music don't affect the game itself but I would like to implement something to spawn notes with the music bpm. This isn't currently the case due to lack of time and skills to properly implement\u00a0a system like this but if you are interested in this project, feel free to contact me on discord (TASSE#7239) or by email (corentin.pacaudboehm@gmail.com).</p>\n<p>This is my second \"big\" unity project. I still have some ideas for this game (difficulty sliders, more modifiers, new note types, ...) but i've decided to stop spending time on this one and switch to another one. I'll maybe update the game with Dualshock controller support if I find someone to help me try things out or if the game has some interest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:32:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dd/5dd0c5b852e63075095d7bb21e3db92b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corentin PB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
