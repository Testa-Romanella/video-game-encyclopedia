It was written by Paul Allen Edelstein as the follow-up to his 1983 game, Wayout, which featured similar maze-based gameplay for one player. Along with its predecessor, Capture the Flag was among the first 3D maze games to offer the player full 360 degree movement, and one of the earliest multiplayer games from a first-person perspective within a 3D rendered environment. A VIC-20 version was also released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/7563ab2199daf05ffa83186e308f392b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit"], "developers": ["Sirius Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sirius Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
