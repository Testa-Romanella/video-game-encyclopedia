While everyone in my family was safe and we thankfully didn't face financial insecurity, the quarantine caught us at a time when we were all separate. Thus the beginning of 2020 was lonely and I felt myself getting into a monotonous routine of locking myself in my room to be \"productive\" and to get schoolwork done, when in reality I just idled by and stressed over my twitter TL. When I realized this, I felt that I had no way to really express this routine, so I made this in hopes that someone gets what I'm saying.</p>\n<p>This also was a test project to learn how to use Godot, which so far I like working in.</p>\n<p>By Jorge Antonio Velasquez Belmonte</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b4/4b4a4e406edda7b33b41a7ed5130364b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gorka_Man"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
