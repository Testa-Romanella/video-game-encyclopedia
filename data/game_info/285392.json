Explore the dream-based worlds and solve light puzzles to help the creatures you meet! The game is heavily inspired by RPG Maker titles like Yume Nikki, except it's set in first person. Please note that I don't own any audio, all sounds come from sites like Looperman and Freesound, just slightly edited.</p>\n<p>Big chunk of content remained in private BabylonJS build but I'm doing my best to convert and improve it. Can't guarantee a complete build though, college takes so much time and I'm still dealing with my motivation. Anyway, hope you enjoy the beta!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f38b45f06517be9018b6bfbfa2e545b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DiV4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
