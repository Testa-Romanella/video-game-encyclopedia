It took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 on both sides of the upper reaches of the Somme, a river in France. The battle was intended to hasten a victory for the Allies. More than three million men fought in the battle and one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the deadliest battles in human history. (wikipedia.org)</p>\n<p>The real battle was the first use of the tank in warfare, however these proved unreliable. In this alternate history it wasn't tanks that the allies introduced, but giant armoured mech's marching across the battlefield destroying all in their way.</p>\n<p>You must take control of your mech and navigate your way across no-mans land, avoiding obstacles and whatever else the enemy throws at you. When you reach the enemy lines you must eliminate any resistance and break through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my submission to the MechJam\u00a0II game jam, built over two weeks in September and October 2021.</p>\n<ul><li>Background music from PlayOnLoop.com,\u00a0Licensed under\u00a0Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0</li><li>Sound effects from FreeSound.org.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to look</li><li>Hold the right mouse button to aim, use the left mouse button to fire</li><li>Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move</li><li>Escape pauses the game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:27:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9dbb05c5598ba736ff409f8c8ff1feea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curious Dog Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
