With obstacles in the way such as pits and debris, Shane can utilise his magical chain to traverse the temple however he seems fit.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was developed in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2021, where this year's theme was Joined Together.</p>\n\n<p>Word of caution! The game utilises poor physics implementation and thusly can act a little bit weird sometimes!
