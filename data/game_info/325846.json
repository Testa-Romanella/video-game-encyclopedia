Its sort of funny, actually, that we can use the very drones sent to kill us to build the giant electromagnetic disruptors that we can use to defend ourselves. The disruptors let us down the drones without destroying their valuable electromagnetic cores. Too bad these defensive towers require so much energy to power.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The last wave destroyed all but our power base. Hopefully we have time to build out enough power nodes and defensive towers to fend off the next wave, and survive another day... or even another hour.</p>\n<p>Our scientists think if we can surround the portals with the disruptors we may be able to close them... lets hope.<br/></p>\n<p>Created for Extra Credits Game Jam 4</p>\n<p>Extra Open - Source code (MIT license):\u00a0https://gitlab.com/youreperfectstudio/ec-jam-4<br/>Extra\u00a0Monochromatic - Hue = 203</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/813/81375628d77749f986e8180c68d2e140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["You're Perfect Studio", "868games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
