The game is inspired by the prototype Banaland Chase, made by Steven Yang. Our game follows in its footsteps, but improves upon it by going more in depth with our level design, art, and multiplayer mechanics. We expanded on Banaland Chase\u2019s level design by adding slippery terrain, more grassy and fenced off areas, and new obstacles that players can hide behind. We expanded artistically by giving the game a new cartoony, hand-drawn, vivid art style, with simple but endearing animations. This aesthetic is reinforced by the game\u2019s silly sound effects and upbeat music, creating a casual and playful atmosphere. Lastly, we expanded the game\u2019s multiplayer capabilities, by designing the game for 2-4 players instead of just 2. To complement the game\u2019s multiplayer capabilities, we have added other gameplay elements, such as the ability to throw each other around, and kick a soccer ball at each other. These mechanics were chosen to promote the game\u2019s playful atmosphere, while simultaneously keeping the game simple and easy to learn.</p>\r\nGame instructions\r\n<p>To start the game, select how many players are playing using the keyboard.
