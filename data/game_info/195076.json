It has a 2 player cooperative mode and goal net physics :D<br/><br/>You can play with your friend/sibling/relative on shared screen or solo! Second player is auto spawned but will not move or impact gameplay if not controled.\u00a0<br/>There are 20 balls (shots) and you have to try to score as many goals as possible. You gain a ball back if you scored. Me and my girlfriend love it so I decide to share it hh.<br/><br/><strong>Player_1 controls ( Shooter )</strong> ;\u00a0<br/>- Mouse movement for angle adjustment<br/>- LMB for shot power<br/>- RMB for shot reset if you see shot is bad<br/>- ARROW KEYS for all kinds of curves on the ball ( Watch the red point on the ball )<br/><br/><strong>Player_2 controls ( Teammate )</strong>;<br/>A - walk left<br/>D - walk right<br/>Shift + A ( or D ) - running mode<br/>R - jump ( hold for more bounce then release ) * Player can rotate in air to adjust his angle with A or D!*<br/>F - volley shot ( hold for power and release )<br/>V - sliding shot ( hold for power and release )<br/><br/>Hope you will like it.
