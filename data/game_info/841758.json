Worse yet, as soon as Ringo has gathered the ingredients, a legion of fairies arrive and steal away all of the jelly.\r\n</li><li>\u00a0Ringo, being downtrodden that all of her days of effort have been undone, is in no mindset to act. It's up to Seiran to grab her mallet and reclaim their lost jelly. </li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Defeat fairies and clear stages by attacking a ball of mochi with Seiran's mallet. Sending the mochi towards cards and fairies will clear them off the screen. Clear every item off the screen to progress. Be careful as being struck by the mochi while it is bouncing outside of your control (indicated by not having a red or green aura) will kill Seiran.</li></ul>\n<p>Seiran can collect money from gold cards that can be used to purchase items from a shop between stages.<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nControlsKeyboardController (Xbox)<br/>MovementArrow Keys<br/>Joystick or DPad<br/>JumpZX or Y<br/>AttackX A<br/>BuntCBPauseEscStart\r\n<p>* You can aim your attacks by holding up or down</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Programming: EasternMouse\r\n<br/>Composition: Eulogous\r\n<br/>Director: Einhope\r\n<br/>Writing and dialogue: Einhope\r\n<br/>Spriting: Rioku, Eulogous\r\n<br/>Animation: Rioku\r\n<br/>Portrait art: Einhope<br/>CG art: Einhope, Aqwa\r\n<br/>BG art: Rioku, Karine, Einhope<br/>Level design: EasternMouse\u00a0<br/>UI design: Easternmouse, Karine, Eulogous\r\n</p>\n<p>Aqwa: Twitter<br/>EasternMouse: Twitter|Itch<br/>Einhope:Twitter<br/>Eulogous: Twitter<br/>Rioku: Twitter| Itch<br/>Karine: Twitter<br/><br/><br/><em>This is a Touhou Project fan work.
