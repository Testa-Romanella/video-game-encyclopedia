(chapter I)", "description": "This is an experimental game in which nobody knows what comes next, not even us. <br/>It is all up to the players who will leave feedback and suggestions after completing each chapter.<br/><br/><br/>We will use the feedback from players to shape the direction of the next chapter. We hope that this unique approach will provide an engaging and thought-provoking experience for all participants, as everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the game. <strong>You can come up with your own character, your own riddle, put something of your own into the game!</strong><br/><br/><br/>Immerse yourself in the mystical atmosphere of an eternal summer evening, with a nostalgic nod to the 80s and 90s Eastern Europe. Our inspiration comes from real objects found in our grandfathers' homes, which we have carefully recreated to transport you back in time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We will curate a selection of player-generated ideas to feature in the upcoming chapter. Moving forward, only paid subscribers will have the opportunity to contribute story influences and suggestions. <br/><br/>However, for the first chapter, all those who have purchased it will be able to participate in this exciting creative endeavour by submitting their own photos or items or ideas for consideration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Our indie game was created by just three of us, and we took on the challenge of developing it in two languages. Our goal was to create puzzles that were out-of-the-box and a plot that was strong enough to keep players hooked. The plot is rich with details and hooks, and each player will have their own interpretation of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The protagonist of our story receives a letter from an old friend, inviting him to visit. Upon arrival at the familiar apartment, he realizes that everything has changed and time seems to have stopped there. As he explores the space, unable to find his friend, he begins to question whether he truly knows this place.<br/><br/>With each new discovery, strange occurrences begin to unfold. This first-person game is set in Eastern Europe at the end of the last century, immersing players in its mysterious atmosphere and evoking nostalgic memories for some.<br/><br/>This linear quest is filled with numerous mysteries that each player will interpret differently. After completing the first chapter, we invite every player to fill out a form describing their vision of the game and submitting options for further plots. Get ready for a journey into the unknown!<br/><br/><br/>The game<strong> supports Xbox gamepad</strong>.<br/>The game has an <strong>autosave system</strong>. In the pause menu we can see where you are now and some hints.<br/><br/>We thank everyone who helped us. And also the guys who sold us the assets. We thank EpicGames, RBL labs and our parents of course!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T05:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/0419677a7cb1559bc58ddbd3de119f15.jpg", "website": "https://www.rbllabs.com/iktp", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SameFrame", "RBL LABS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RBL LABS"], "esrb_rating": null}
