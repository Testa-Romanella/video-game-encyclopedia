The Goal is to survive as long as possible on an unstable platform you must balance by moving explosive\u00a0crates and rocks either left or right. Rocks will be falling from the ceiling as the platform ventures further into a cave. If a rocks falls onto another rock, both break. If it falls onto a crate, it explodes, leading to your death.<br/>Every asset or piece or code used was made by me during the Jam.</p>\n<p> Any Feedback is appreciated !</p>\n<p>Controls :\r\nWASD - Move\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Lift / Release</p>\n<p>R - Reset (In case of death or softlock, I haven't managed to make a Game Over screen ^^\")</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:20:53", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zeelyrules"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
