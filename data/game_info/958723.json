The game\u00a0starts at floor 0, and then in each floor, enemies are there to be fought and rewards to be taken using a team of characters that can be upgraded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fights between the player team and enemy team will be AI controlled based.</p>\n<p>Everything is random, from the first character to the items that are given as a reward. The player will have the ability to choose from a set of random chars and items and then buy new items and abilities for each character</p>\n<p>The idea is still in progress so everything can change and be upgraded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like the mini mini prototype, feel free to subscribe to my itch, and give new ideas to create a good roguelike game.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb6/eb643c4dcd4dbd35ee909fbef94bf432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FH_Creator"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
