{"id": 624967, "slug": "orb-arena", "name": "Orb Arena", "name_original": "Orb Arena", "description": "<p>This cursed gargoyle statue attacks anyone who dare approach it. Click to use your magical shield to reflect its attacks back at it. Whoever is stuck first by the other's attack will perish!<br/></p>\n<p>Given that this was made in 3 hours, I of course didn't get to finish nearly everything I wanted to (I was hoping to give the gargoyle a Breakout-style barrier for protection), but it's still playable. It's super easy if you just reflect the very first orb back at the gargoyle before it launches the second orb. For a challenge, wait for it to launch its first few orbs before attempting to fight back.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that your shield doesn't bounce orbs in the direction you click - where you click just determines what side of your character is being shielded. The orbs bounce off your shield as they would bounce off a circle surrounding your player. This behavior felt unintuitive in playtesting, and if\u00a0I were to expand the game, I'd likely change it so clicking in a given direction indeed bounces orbs in that direction.<br/></p>\n<p>Art used:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>5 direction witch walking sprite by Spring</li><li>Gargoyle by dr_corchit</li><li>A cute dungeon by Buch</li><li>Modified Pixel Orbs by Flowly</li></ul>\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Most Stereotypical Boss Theme Ever\" by Spring</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T05:12:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ae/7aea924decf2dcd89e1b4eb407634e6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Birdwards"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
