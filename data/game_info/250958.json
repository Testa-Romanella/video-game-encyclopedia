You still start from level 1, which is really very easy, then, as you go on with strokes, difficulty level will go up and it will be very hard to get out of ghosts, blades and skulls to reach the last level! If you get there alive, be sure that you will not hold fast for a long time.<br/><br/>Game rules are very simple: you need to make groups of at least 3 equal pieces to make strokes and gain game space. You just need to play once to understand. From next game, you will be ready to the challenge to get to the prohibitive level: level 9. At first sight, it does not look so hard, but to get to the last level you need to be rather crafty, then, after getting skilful, you will use game tactics that are more and more effective to break records.\u00a0<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9deae0165916ceadb5f941c6d06a196.jpg", "website": "http://www.arcastudio.it/apps/ToTrisHalloween.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Arcastudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Arcastudio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
