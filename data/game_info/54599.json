{"id": 54599, "slug": "4x4-evo", "name": "4x4 Evo", "name_original": "4x4 Evo", "description": "<p>4x4 Evo (also re-released as 4x4 Evolution) is a video game developed by Terminal Reality for the Windows, Macintosh, PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast platforms. It is one of the first console games to have cross-platform online play where Dreamcast, Macintosh and Windows versions of the game appear online at the same time. The game can use maps created by users to download onto a hard drive, as well as a Dreamcast VMU. All versions of the game are similar in quality and gameplay, although the online systems feature a mode to customize the players' own truck and use it online. The game is still online-capable on all systems except for PlayStation 2. This was Terminal Reality's only video game to be released for the Dreamcast.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-17T21:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf9b237c372cebc097670128486bc9fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.04, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 10, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 20}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 26, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 26, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "Classic Macintosh", "PlayStation 2", "PC"], "developers": ["Terminal Reality"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Gathering of Developers"], "esrb_rating": null}
