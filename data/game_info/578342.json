However, members of the Hands of Shadows soon realized what happened and were in hot pursuit of GHOST and her friend. The friend was hunted down, but GHOST was able to escape to the monster realm. Will she be able to stay safe in the monster realm? Can she successfully lose her pursuers and start a new life?...</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by platformers from the past and the present, codename:GHOST will feel right at home for fans of platformers. Shoot, jump, and dash your way through the first\u00a0two levels in this demo, and make the realm of monsters your home.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: This is a short demo of the game. This game is still in development, and will hopefully be released sometime this year.\u00a0There is no definitive release date yet, but the goal is to get it out the door this year. Since this is a demo, things are subject to change. Your feedback is heavily appreciated, as it helps me make the game better and better.
