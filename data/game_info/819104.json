Each turn, click on your die to get a random number of moves. Move that many squares and try to land on top of an enemy piece. Next is the enemies' turn - if they land on you, you lose! When moving your die, be mindful of where you'll end up and whether you will be vulnerable to enemy attack.<br/></p>\n<p><em>I recommend starting with the 8 handcrafted levels, and then moving on to ENDLESS for unlimited fun!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>ENDLESS Mode can be unstable - if the page freezes after clicking the button, please refresh the page and try again.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Enemies include:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Pawn - Looks like a dot, can move one space in any direction.</p>\n<p>Rook - Looks like a cross or plus, can move three spaces horizontally or vertically.</p>\n<p>Bishop - Looks like an X, can move two spaces diagonally.</p>\n<p>Queen - Looks like a gear with a dot, can move to any of the immediate 8 spaces and one space further horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Do be aware that enemies can jump over other enemies and gaps, as long as the final position is valid!</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Attributions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Title screen was photographed and edited by me.
