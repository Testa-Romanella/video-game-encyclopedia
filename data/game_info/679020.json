The answer is Laser Ball! A fast-paced game where you protect your goal from an onslaught of balls. Use your powers to your advantage, extending your paddle, or shortening your opponent's paddle! Fire lasers that bounce the balls away from you! Can you defeat the computer opponent?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is an\u00a0old project that I decided to revisit. Upon looking at the code,\u00a0I decided to rewrite most of it, which took something like ten hours over the course of two days.\u00a0The old version had some code for a mobile version and a two-player side-by-side mode. If you like the idea of either of those ideas, let me know! As always, feedback and criticism is welcome.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b61/b61d4d1d1c9b0b3ae98f2fb628962830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheSyXan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
