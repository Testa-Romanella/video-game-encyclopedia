You'll have to deal with these souls, and make sure you can still guide them all to the afterlife.</p>\n<p>This was made for the 2020 GMTK game jam in collaboration with IDislikeNames. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Move Soul</p>\n<p>Tab/Numbers/Scroll: Switch Active Soul (you can also click a soul)<br/></p>\n<p>Enter/Click: Advance Text</p>\n<p>WASD: Move Camera</p>\n<p>Space: Reset Camera</p>\n<p>Escape: Exit Game</p><p>Click the reset button in the top right to reset a level.
