The problem is that it seems like everything is trying to break you! <br/><br/>The gameplay is as simple as it is satisfying. The Ball can only jump, and perform an air dash in one of 4 directions. Upon colliding with an object that doesn't break you, you are free to dash again. Use this to navigate a variety of challenges and hazards, including spikes, cannons and even giant monsters. <br/><br/>It's featuring challenging but fair difficulty, the skill lies in your timing, and ability to react.  <br/><br/>Features <br/><br/>- Simple, accessible controls. Simple taps and swipes are all you need to play<br/>- Tough but fair difficulty <br/>- So many levels to challenge and conquer <br/>- Multiple leaderboards to challenge your friends!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1420eddcf2a9d525d4d2a1fa9cd4b06b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kelly Kim"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kelly Kim"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
