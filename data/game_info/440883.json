Not only does this simulator do A* with the 3 key, it also does two different pathfinding algorithms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keypad 1: First bot, algorithm created to pick a possible cardinal position and move to it.</p>\n<p>Keypad 2: Second bot, algorithm created to walk until a wall it hit, then decides to pick a new cardinal position and rinse/repeat.</p>\n<p>Keypad 3: Third bot: algorithm created to pick the most efficient path via A*</p>\n<p>This assignment taught me about the importance of knowing how to program and the best way of doing so via O.O.P. Furthermore, it has shown me the way of creating an algorithm by using what I've learned in data structures and that in itself is powerful.</p>\n<p>I specifically choose this topic because I felt proud that after three long days, I've got an algorithm working and debugging by using primitives. These primitives are particularly strong because it shows exactly where the bot tried to go and how it's backtracking! I absolutely love it in all honestly.</p>\n<p>The usefulness of this is far too great. The main lessons learned include basic things like: come up with a class diagram before tackling a difficult algorithm and create more class utilities such that the code becomes shorter. A* happens to be one of the most difficult algorithms to study and I've tackled this problem myself with my own code that I could easily place into a library--with my name on it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T05:45:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/872/872bead1dc3f81bec3f16806c3397cf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Derreck O'Neil"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
