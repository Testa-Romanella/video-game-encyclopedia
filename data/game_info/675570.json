One terminal.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>This is BRUTEFORCE. A thrilling, sandbox, terminal-based mystery.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is 1996. Early morning. The player, a hacker, suddenly receives word of an attack on the ceasefire negotiations.\r\n</p>\n<p>Something has got to be done. And you are the one with the skillset to do it.\r\n</p>\n<p>A contact offers you four suspects. An investigation is necessary. Perhaps one that goes beyond that which the law can condone.\r\n</p>\n<p>The hacker\u2019s only tool is a old computer that is suffering from heat issues.\r\n</p>\n<p>We recommend fetching a pen and a piece of paper for this one. Strange, I know, but you might need it for the investigation.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Developer\u2019s note: All characters and locations depicted are entirely fictional.
