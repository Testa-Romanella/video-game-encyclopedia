The game borrows ideas from Camus's famous paper \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" and looks at how Sisyphus might make his torment more bearable. By compartmentalizing different portions of his climb into levels and setting small goals Sisyphus takes control of his repetitive existence. Elements of pool and mini-golf find their way into the game and are combined with interesting and challenging level design, slow motion, and of course, existential dread.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb63d10e7dfe20254e2b26c90419301.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AustinCaskie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
