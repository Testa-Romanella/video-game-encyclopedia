Players can control the direction of the aircraft flight only by controlling the direction keys on the keyboard, and the infinite bullets are automatically fired. In each level, there will be various monsters flying randomly from all directions to the aircraft and releasing attack bullets. With the difficulty of the level upgrading, the number of monsters is increasing, and the survival space of the aircraft is getting narrower. How can we escape the siege of monsters and survive? The test is the player's spatial imagination and logical thinking. The beautiful CG can be unlocked after successfully passing the test, which is a reward for players!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T06:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f5687b925e82439878874ca87ecf27f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BBQ Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["BBQ Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
