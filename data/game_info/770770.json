Hoping to add Meta Avatar support and cooler beaches in later versions.</p>\n<p>Note: I'm currently only using the free version of a networking software which supports up to 30 people at a time. If this gets popular I'll pay the $50 a month for unlimited users, but I can't afford it right now. I don't think it will get that popular anyway, but please let me know if you run into any issues!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f8517637ce5525bb9e04fd85b58a9c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["cazforshort"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
