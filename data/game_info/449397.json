It's also my first game and it\u00a0was made with Godot Engine.\u00a0You are just a point who lives his life of point, and collects other points to take part in\u00a0its kingdom. Once it's done, prepare to FIGHT other kingdoms\u00a0 via very unrealistic besieges.</p>\n<p>Controls : This game is only playing with the mouse. To besiege the cities (which are just other points, the graphist was sick), click and drag following the lines.</p>\n<p>I find my game very easy, I will nerf the score system soon. The second part of the game is impossible in hardcore mode though, but you'll easily reach 1kk points even with that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T03:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72cb61fdef2592b4e3951f2731c7d9f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sagititi 34"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
