(Tip: Put the other player in a tough spot! Their turn will begin right after.)<br/>3: Wonky aim - When shooting the ball, you won't be going exactly where you were aiming!<br/>4: Spin - The ball gets spun wildly!<br/>5: Colorblind - You can't differentiate the balls!<br/>6: Weak shot - You can't shoot the ball as hard as normal!</p>\n<p>Tip: You can press escape to go back to the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T02:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdb3e135d03889e0772a9770a0252577.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CenTdemeern1", "Team CrystalHail"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
