{"id": 16355, "slug": "evolve-stage-2", "name": "Evolve Stage 2", "name_original": "Evolve Stage 2", "description": "<p>Evolve Stage 2 is a free-to-play team-based FPS developed by Turtle Rock Studios.</p>\n<p>Set in the distant future, where the humans are able to colonize other planets. On a distant planet known as Shear, the humans are met with heavy alien resistance. William Cabot gets out of retirement to evacuate the colonists and assembles a team of Hunters in order to assist him in this.</p>\n<p>Evolve Stage 2 is focused on asymmetric co-operative and competitive multiplayer. There are 5 players in a match, 4 of which are the Hunters. The Hunters have limited time to find the Monster, while the latter has to evolve and grow stronger. The Monster is given a 30-second advantage over the Hunters in order to escape and hide somewhere on the map. </p>\n<p>Evolve Stage 2 features a class system with 4 classes present in the game. It is not possible for multiple players to use the same class in the match. Classes differ in their abilities and weapons. The same goes for the Monsters as there are five Monsters featured in the game. In contrast to the Hunters which are controlled from a first-person perspective, the game switches to a third-person camera while playing as a Monster.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2015-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/28a/28a895c2e05e508dca8fd73c51492d59.jpg", "website": "http://www.evolveupdates.com/stage2/", "rating": 2.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 113, "owned": 3410, "beaten": 75, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 340, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 447, "suggestions_count": 677, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 447, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Turtle Rock Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["2K Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
