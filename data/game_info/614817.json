Lucky him, there's a cool looking wand in the room he fell into.</p>\n<p>Shoot stuff, run around, do whatever (It's a top-down shooter).\u00a0Your enemies will try to get you down by trying to impose rules on you; just shoot 'em. Shoot the chains to break the rules. Sometimes those you think are your greatest enemies aren't all that bad\u00a0so just try to be nice. We're all a scared little kobold in a cool hat sometimes.</p>\n<p>Made most stuff myself\u00a0with Unity, Blender, Paint.net, Bfxr, Audacity.\u00a0The pathfinding was Unity. Not my fault. So if the enemies are\u00a0really jittery, blame it on Unity, not me. I think it's still my fault with the way I'm having pathing fighting with the physics.</p>\n<p>Code if you want:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/RunnerWizard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c39eff6f261f130ccf99ca92b0328c81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Solrun"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
