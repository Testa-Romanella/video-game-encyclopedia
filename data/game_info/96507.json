Create a deck of various abilities, then put it to the test in a procedurally generated death labyrinth! Cards are activated by spending Energy, which is earned by killing enemies. Yay, feedback loops!</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tRogue Android is still very early in development, so much of what you see now will likely change. I certainly plan on adding many new rooms, enemies, cards, bosses, and extra features into the mix! On that note, I'd love to hear any and all constructive feedback you have on the game thus far. I want Rogue Android to be the best game it can be, and getting its players' opinions is my top priority.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tInterested in getting updates on the project?
