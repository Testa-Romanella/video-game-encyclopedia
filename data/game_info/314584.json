Luckily, you're a cat and therefore got 7 of them. Even luckier: you can steal the other cat's lifes by shooting them with your big-ass gun.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The first upgrades come cheap. But watch out, the really good upgrades, that make you a flying bulletstorm of pain and agony for everyone around you, cost up to 5 lifes and even a badass life-stealer like you, can never hold more than 7.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So power up your boots, distribute aerial-style headshots like a croupier of death and become the ultimate killing-machine.\u00a0<br/>Only after you took all lifes of your enemies, you will be victorious.</p>\n<p>But wait, there is more: To spice things up, you can just start again in a brand new, one of a kind arena, you have never seen before.</p>\n<p>PS.
