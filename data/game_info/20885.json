Use your remorseless katana skills to find each level's Demon Heart and then cut into its flesh to advance to the next level! Will you slay all the Demon Hearts? Will you slay them faster than your friends? Will you become the ultimate Demon Heart slayer?<br/>Music by Phat Boi J: http://phatboij.newgrounds.com/<br/>Download the Soundtrack on http://demonhearts.com<br/><strong>* 50+ Levels<br/>* Unlockable Characters<br/>* Timed Levels For Speed Running Fun!<br/>* Bumpin Trance Soundtrack<br/>* Steam Achievements<br/>* Steam Trading Cards<br/>* Drippy Pink Blood<br/>* Active Developer Support</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c1dc01367ef4e501c36e860cfa1a32.jpg", "website": "http://www.demonhearts.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 72}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jon Harwood Creations"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jon Harwood Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
