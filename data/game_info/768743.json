{"id": 768743, "slug": "fru-trap", "name": "Fru-trap", "name_original": "Fru-trap", "description": "<p>This is the game I made for the respawn game jam 2022.</p>\n<p>In the game you play as a wizard who is stuck inside a maze with a door on the other side as the only way out. However, to open the door you need 5 keys , which you need to find in the maze. But the catch is - just finding the way won't solve the problem , as the keys are guarded by zombies. The wizard however , can use his magical powers to make traps to kill the zombies. He gets this ability by eating fruits lying around inside the maze.</p>\n<p>Instructions to play the game :</p>\n<p>1. Main objective is to open the door on the other side of the maze.</p>\n<p>2. To open it, firstly you have to collect all 5 keys (walk over the keys to collect them) , once collected , go to the door and press 'E' on the keyboard to open and finish the game.<br/></p>\n<p>3. You will find fruits lying around ; eating them gives you ability to make 2 traps of the same colour. These traps in turn kill zombies of the same colour if they step on it (Traps don't affect the wizard). Basically, the colour you eat is the colour you make.\u00a0 (What you eat is what you make ).</p>\n<p>The colour scheme is as follows :\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. use 'W' , 'S' , 'A' , 'D' , to move.</p>\n<p>5. To eat a fruit , go near it and press 'E'. ( also press 'E' to open door)</p>\n<p>6. \u00a0To lay traps press 'Q' . Traps are placed at the current\u00a0position of\u00a0the wizard.</p>\n<p>7. Press 'Esc' key to pause the game.</p>\n\n<p>8. Even if you are eaten by the zombies one time don't worry , for every new game you have a second chance , indicated by the heart on the top left corner of the screen. You will be respawned to the location of the last key you had collected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>9. The instructions are available on the tutorial/help screen.</p>\n<p>Hints :</p>\n<p>1. You need not kill all the zombies to get to the keys , use the maze to your advantage.</p>\n<p>2. Zombies like to stay near the keys , so if there is a zombie there is a key nearby.</p>\n<p>Known glitches :</p>\n<p>The 'next' and 'back' button on the tutorial screen need to be pressed two times. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be9/be9db57e0491de6224dd953f8e837c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xepektov"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
