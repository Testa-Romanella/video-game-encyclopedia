Several decades of tranquility have passed since the threat of The Immortui was ended and The Necromancer was imprisoned within the orb. But always danger is lurking and a new threat has emerged. One by one, with a peculiar red gleam in their eyes, the people have begun to fall into darkness. Lying, stealing, ranting, harming... even doing murder; 'The Madness' spreads fear and doubt like a magical plague. Deemed by those skilled in leechcraft to be some sort of mystical prion of the soul, your party of adventurers must set out to discover the source of this infection and to find a remedy if they are able. The unexplained coma-like slumber of a young girl named Sparrow is your only clue. Massive exploration, puzzling enigmas, countless in-depth conversations, lost secrets, and harrowing combat in a vast open world await you and your party as you seek answers. But will you prevail in time? <br/></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Character creation with modifiable skills and attributes.</li><li>'Paper Doll' style character representation.</li><li>Hundreds of items including\u00a0 clothing, musical instruments, custom forged weapons and armor and various other loot.</li><li>Dozens of magical spells and songs.</li><li>Party of up to 5 interchangeable characters.</li><li>Drop off or pick up PCs during quest at adventurer guilds in towns.</li><li>Tactical turn-based combat.</li><li>Vast 900 x 900 tile over-world map.</li><li>Expansive multi-layer underworld and structure interiors maps.</li><li>Over 500 individually hand-drawn tiles create a diverse and stunning world.</li><li>Beautiful and unique retro pixel art style.</li><li>Nonlinear story progression with completely open world exploration.</li><li>Hundreds of NPCs with extensive keyword-parsed conversations.</li><li>50+ monsters with unique skills, attacks, and behaviors.</li><li>Plenty of noncritical secrets and hidden areas to find and explore.</li><li>Engaging original musical score.</li><li>In-game mapping function.</li><li>40-60+ hours of play to complete.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>OKLABSOFT Website</strong><strong>:</strong> OKLABSOFT<br/></p><p><strong>OKLABSOFT Discord:</strong> DISCORD<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Download Lurking I for FREE now on Itch.io:</strong> Lurking I <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b0136c64e3f42fe6c88c63a3018429.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oklabsoft"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
