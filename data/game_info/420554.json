In this arena, you can show your skills of annihilating various enemies! The more rounds you survive, the better mage you are.<br/></p>\n<p>You have four spells to do your job:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Fireball</strong>. A good old classic, it has a tremendous high cast speed. However, it deals small damage.</li><li><strong>Icicles</strong>. You cast a cone of icicles, which are incredibly deadly on short distances, but they tend to melt pretty quickly.</li><li><strong>Meteor</strong>. Big and exploding piece of rock, it's great to blow up a crowd of demons, but it moves slow.</li><li><strong>Arcane spear</strong>. The choice of the most skilful mages. It penetrates all the enemies but requires charging and good aim, but on a maximum charge, it destroys everything.</li></ol>\n<p>However, there is the icing on the cake - ULTIMATE!</p>\n<p>Kill your enemies, pick up ultimate mana, and activate this ability to annihilate the world\u00a0your enemies!</p>\r\nGAME CONTROLS\r\n<strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Xbox (PS4) game pad</strong><strong>Action</strong>W, A, S, DLeft StickMoveSpaceA (X)DashMouseRight StickAimLMBRT (R2)Shoot1, 2, 3, 4 or ScrollD-pad left/rightSwitch WeaponsQB (O)Activate ultimateEscapeStartPause\r\nMENU CONTROLS\r\n<strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Game pad</strong>\n<strong>Action</strong>W, A, S, DLeft StickSelect menu itemEnterA (X)Accept\r\nABOUT THE GAME\r\n<p>This game I've developed for 1.5 months with Game Maker 2. I had started it on GGJ 2020, but something went wrong. I've made 4 overhauls of main combat systems to make them better. Hope, you'll enjoy Cast-n-Blast.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Code and design by\u00a0<strong>me</strong>.</p>\n<p>Art by\u00a0<strong>0x72</strong>, you can download it\u00a0<strong>here</strong>.</p>\n<p>Logo by\u00a0<strong>@homyashas</strong></p>\n<p>Contains music \u00a92019 <strong>Joshua McLean</strong> (<strong>mrjoshuamclean.com</strong>)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</p>\n<p>Special thanks for everyone, who helped me during this endeavour by play testing and giving valuable feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:26:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/13780a903bf3925e033773e0b3f8d69f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tricky_Fat_Cat"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
