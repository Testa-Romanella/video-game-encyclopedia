Hourray ! I was a pleasure to make Bonfire. Great idea, some fancy music experience ( yeah testing Computer/Ai generated music was something ), good visuals, and burning (lot of) trees has something oddly satisfying. I\u2019m fine with the result, it exceed my expectations !</li>\n<li><strong>Colin Bellino</strong>:\u00a0This was felt good from the beginning. I had fun with the theme and the art and we had time for a polish phase at the end because the gameplay loop was so simple. I wish we had time to make more levels though :o</li></ul>\r\nTools used\r\n<ul><li>Unity (game engine):\u00a0https://unity3d.com/</li><li>Aseprite (pixel art):\u00a0https://www.aseprite.org/</li><li>Streamlab (streaming):\u00a0https://streamlabs.com/</li><li>SFRX (sound effects generator):\u00a0http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html</li><li>Odin inpector (inspector tool for unity):\u00a0https://odininspector.com/</li><li>Stateless (state machine c#):\u00a0https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless</li><li>Wolfram (music):\u00a0http://tones.wolfram.com</li><li>BitPotion (font):\u00a0https://joebrogers.itch.io/bitpotion</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29a/29a56ef6165c888936be0f9fa99582d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Colin Bellino", "AtomH"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
