You also must make it to the end of the level without running out of gas. There is a gas can pick-up that refuels your gas tank giving you more time to exit. If you crash the level resets and you have to try again. Use WASD to move.\u00a0 This is my first game so I hope you have a fun time playing and that there aren't that many bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T10:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05b/05b176714b011ce881b1bfa50ed39978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrandonCort"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
