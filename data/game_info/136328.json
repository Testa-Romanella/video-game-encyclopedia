With limitless power and possibilities, what would you do? How far would you go? These are the questions explored in \"Yes, Master\"; the story of one man's transformation from standard NPC to video game hero, or something else entirely.</p><p>\"Yes, Master\" explores the ideas of control and unspoken desires of gamers everywhere. Video games are about controlling an avatar, a car, pieces of a puzzle, etc. Players do this to have fun and experience things that simply don't occur in everyday life, be it flying with a jet pack or engaging in a rage-fueled firefight through city streets. But maybe there a cost to violence for the sake of fun, even when simulated within the confines of a video game world.</p><p>Concept, Code, Art and Sound Design by Andrew Benson, Laurenz Rau &amp; Le\u00f4nidas Pereira</p><p>Soundtrack by Alex Scisse &amp; Alex Talarico</p><p>Voice Over by Alex Scisse</p><p>Built in Unity 4, written in C Sharp</p><p>(2014)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf44c3f49e3496a48de675824ede0ae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Andrew Benson"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
