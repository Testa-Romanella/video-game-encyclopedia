Your parents are out of town,\u00a0you're home alone and now\u00a0in charge to take care of the house and your four-legged Friend!</p>\n<p>However, as the child of an Escape-Room fanatic those tasks become increasingly harder than one might think. Solve the puzzles your Father has prepared for you and make your way through his task list!</p>\n<p>But... somehow, this uneasy feeling can't be helped that maybe you're not as alone as initially thought.</p>\r\nStruggling with the puzzles?\r\n<p>Though the Puzzles themselves are not super complex, they could be tricky for some. Therefore I provided a guide\u00a0 containing\u00a0the\u00a0codes and explanations on <strong>how </strong>the puzzles are solved!\u00a0(you can find it in the .txt document\u00a0in the downloadable file)</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nDeveloper Note\r\n<p>This game was done for my 4th semester of game development. The task was to make a puzzle game to which I decided to add horror elements. It is a solo project and is the first game I made towards the horror genre.
