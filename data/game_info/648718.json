This is because I needed a simple game to make to be sure to learn how to use Godot more than how to make a game. I don't know if it makes sense, but I get what I wanted. I'm now ready to make the \"bigger game\" I mentioned in the little webcomic. I really want to do a <em>real</em> game for once.</p>\n<p>Musics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level 1: Sylvain Adas</li>\n<li>Approximative dash: Nathan Bottet</li>\n<li>Titlescreen, Spooky beat, Stressed bits and Grand finale: Mathieu Casubolo</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T08:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bae/bae42f0e0c5e538555d56968621e1652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Scrolling Bird"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
