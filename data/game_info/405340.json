Oh no! The jump is stuck! You must try to beat the levels while using this 'bug' to your advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Developer's note:</p>\n<p>This was created for 'Wowie Jam 2.0', and the theme was 'intentional bugs'. My interpretation of this was\u00a0to intentionally break the jump, so that you must find a way to beat the (5) levels by using this 'bug' to your advantage. Also, in the final level the enemies jitter around randomly, so be careful! Controls are 'A' and 'D' for left and right movement and 'Space' to jump.</p>\n<p>This was made over the past couple of days in my free time. It isn't my best work so far\u00a0 but I tried my best to get something out, because there is nothing more that I dislike than missing deadlines.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>-Caleb (LebbyFoxx).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:15:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a98/a98e14df44ab72660f5befaa6c10ed83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
