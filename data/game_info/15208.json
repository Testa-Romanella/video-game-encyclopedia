No doubt, this game is no exception.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSecret Santa is a pixel art 2D arcade stealth game featuring Santa doing what most would consider illegal and sneaking through people's house at night. Your job is simple. Guide Santa to the Christmas tree of every house and drop presents off without being detected, shot, chopped, or blown up in the process. Enjoy 30 stages of Santa working his way through the nice and naughty list, only to face the real challenges ahead with 3 more difficult lists on his belt to overcome.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dcb560e4192365aba33bc911d8601f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 121}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Jonathan Bourke"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
