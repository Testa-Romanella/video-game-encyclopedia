This time you\u2019re going to have to move all over the map, hammer away to upgrade your towers, throw over-powered chanclas recklessly and shoot electric beams from weaponized pizza at your enemies. Fight from the front lines!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Not the hero we wanted, but the one we got stuck with:</strong> <br/>After the whole squad sent by the World Treaty for Freedom (WTF) got fried by a burrito-related explosion, it\u2019s on Elliott Salazar, the cartoon-obsessed facility technician and the only survivor, to save Earth. There\u2019s a new captain onboard: Captain ToonHead!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Take control of your towers: </strong><br/>Take manual control of a tower to project lethal beams of hot sauce from your hands, ignite infinite heat-seeking fireworks, irresponsibly spray a snowball machine gun, shoot rays from electrified pizza slices or unleash a pi\u00f1ata blitz over your enemies.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Balance action and strategy: </strong><br/>You're going to do a lot of shooting, that\u2019s for sure, but shooting alone will not defeat the waves of Cyberchickens, punks and Terra-sharks. You\u2019re going to have to combine those Pi\u00f1ata towers and chancla throws in a very strategic way if you want to save more Enercubes and destroy the EarthRadicator-1000.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T02:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e8bf7ef8bf649ce154e6a7f17c4bfff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teravision Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Teravision Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
