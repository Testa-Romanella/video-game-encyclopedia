It was a mixture between platform and exploration game with wonderful graphics and atmosphere, but with a lack of interaction (with the inhabitants of Knytt&#39;s world) and action. All in all more a piece of art than a real game.</p>\n<p>Now Nifflas has released a sequel called &quot;Knytt Stories&quot; (which takes place in the same world as &quot;Knytt&quot;) and the game is beautiful as well, but much more challenging than original &quot;Knytt&quot;. There are more monsters and a whole bunch of special abilities (upgrades) to be found now and there are three difficulty modes.</p>\n<p>The basic game consists of a tutorial and one adventure (&quot;The Machine&quot;), but there are several new adventures (made by Nifflas himself or by fans) you can download from this place, on Nifflas homepage or in his forum.</p>\n<p>And best is: &quot;Knytt Stories&quot; comes along with an easy to use editor. So if you still think the game is to easy then you can start to create your own adventures.</p>\n<p>P.S.: Please look at the installation process. I haven&#39;t seen something that cute and funny for a very long time... </p>\n<p>A more modern retake of Knnyt Stories, Knytt Stories+, is also available at http://egomassive.com/ks/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-09T12:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/636713990c1dfc18b26479c7e41ea5d5.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/Knytt_Stories", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicklas Nygren"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Nicklas Nygren"], "esrb_rating": null}
