(Bounce Back Games)", "description": "Don't Get Caught!\r\n<p><strong><em>Don't Get Caught!</em>\u00a0</strong> is a very basic and fun game where the player must rush to the end of the level without getting caught by the ever-following <strong><em>red hunter</em></strong>.\u00a0 Many obstacles lay in our player's way, such as harmless <em><strong>blue players</strong> </em>who can get in the player's way, <strong><em>mucky patches</em> </strong>which slow the player down, <strong><em>moving obstacles</em> </strong>and sometimes even other dreaded<strong> </strong><em><strong>red hunters</strong></em>.<br/></p>\n<p>However, to make the player's life easier, they may come across two <em>power-ups</em>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Phase Pill</strong> - A pill which allows the player to temporarily phase through walls, and even other players</li><li><strong>Force Field Orb</strong> - An orb which\u00a0will give the player a temporary force field that pushes the pesky blue players out of the way with ease</li></ul>\n<p>The player may also cross<strong> </strong><em><strong>ice patches</strong></em> which will give the player a quick little boost in speed.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>This is best played with a controller, but also should be fine for people used to using the keyboard. The controls are very simple:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Movement -\u00a0</strong>WASD/Arrow keys or\u00a0Left-Stick</li><li><strong>Select </strong>- ENTER key or A button</li><li><strong>Pause/Back</strong> - ESC key or B button</li><li><strong>Phase Power</strong> - SPACE key or A button</li></ul>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Don't Get Caught! is my first entry into the game development world. I am very much a beginner and this game is a learning experience for me. I have resisted the constant urge to improve and add to the game, instead I have followed some great advice I've heard from more experienced developers: <em>keep it simple,\u00a0finish the game and move on!</em> As a result, this game is extremely basic and ugly. I stuck to basic shapes, colors, even fonts, doing the bare minimum to implement my ideas.<br/></p>\n<p>I am very proud of what I have created here, but completely understand how others will look at this and think it's complete sh*te! That's okay. But I still think there is some fun to be had here and this is certainly a concept I will return to in the future when I have (hopefully) the experience and ability to expand on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T15:41:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f28396709670ba9b8f7df973a7482f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Bounce Back Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
