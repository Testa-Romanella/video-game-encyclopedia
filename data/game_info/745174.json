There are opportunities for quests immediately available in the starting town and some quests will show up only after the early quests are completed. Dialog with various NPCs will change depending on quests the party has completed. Some of the NPCs drop various hints about places to go and things to see as well as hints to the plot for the end game.</p>\n<p>Currently Windows only. Controls are mouse and keyboard and can be configured from the main menu in the game.</p>\n<p>Still in active development with new features and, of course, bug fixes as time permits. Currently have roughly 4 hours of playable content with enough variety you can play a number of times trying different ways of doing things. You can freely travel between maps giving sort of an open world feel although there is some guidance to prompt you into the main storyline but you can ignore it and freely explore if you wish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T11:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/1372a567ae8abb0240f4bbb1535e6451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zzmmorgan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
