Jumping on cute enemies, collecting coins, and all that. But sometimes, you want something more, like taking a boat to the city of the dead or explore a fallen spaceship or just ride on an angry cloud. Then it's a game for you! Explore an island full of wonderful creatures that want you dead, find powerful artifacts or apples, they are good too. So let's go to the numbers:\u00a0 50+ levels, 20+bosses, and 2 player mode.</p>\n<p>The story is short: There are 5 princesses, they were captured, save them. It's enough motivation to start crushing everything, but is it? So start your own adventure!</p>\n<p>(Game is free until 01.03.21)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/942/9421a3165d0ca214a39ff16a1407864d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxmanta"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
