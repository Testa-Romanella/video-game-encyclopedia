I was the designer and he was the code-master. So yeah this is our first time doing a game. Took us a time for a gameplay of 5 minutes, but I will say, that I'm so happy that I did my first ever game + points for myself for doing all the animations, environment and so on. I had a ton of fun learning new stuff and seeing the process of making a game. My friend had 'fun' too in Unity.</p>\n<p>Story: You are Kevin, a home alone boy where it has go to school but it will be stopped by none other than the worst enemy of the nature. TRASHCANS. Oh yeah, there is a potato too, say hi to John.</p>\n<p>WASD- TO MOVE</p>\n<p>LEFT CLICK- SHOOT</p>\n<p>Hope you like those 2 min epic gameplay, and I wonder if someone will pass 8k points. I've only done 7.8k in my playthroughs.<br/>Edit: nvm i did 7.9k</p>\n<p>Oh yeah there is power-ups that totally were told what they are doing. But if you still don't know what does each other.
