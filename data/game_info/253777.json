Space 2048 moves the old 2048 game into outer space with great visuals, animations and the entire universe as background. Move entire planets to get to your score, surrounded by galaxies, suns and asteroids.<br/><br/>For an engulfing game experience Space 2048 includes a soundtrack and great sound effects. You can quit the game at any time and continue exactly where you left off later. There is an undo for any mistakes you might make and you always have a history of your last 8 scores available.<br/><br/>The rules for the Space 2048 game are very simple. There are only four game moves. Use the arrow buttons to move to the left, the right, the top or the bottom. All planets will then move into that direction as far as they can. Planets of the same kind will merge into a new planet with their combined value and your score is updated. You win once you have one planet with the value of 2048. And that is much easier said then done.<br/><br/>Visuals are a big part of the gaming experience and to match the overall theme all interface elements like the triple setting sound switch for example (full sound with background music, effects only or sound off) rotate floating in space. And while the true stars - pun intended - of Space 2048 are the planets with their magnificent slow rotation, they are more than matched in grandiosity by those fascinating backdrops. The latter are images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope with titles like \"Antennae Galaxies\" or \"Ring Nebula\". <br/><br/>Space 2048 makes for ideal casual entertainment. The galactic backgrounds become more dramatic the further along you get in your game and you keep adding new planets. The soundtrack specifically written for Space 2048 enhances the overall atmosphere as soft background component. And then most importantly there still is the goal - to get to the magic number - 2048. So this truly is - the most fun you ever had in outer space.<br/><br/>Features<br/>\u2022 Fully animated with superb visuals<br/>\u2022 Great soundtrack and effects<br/>\u2022 History of played games<br/>\u2022 Undo and Resume functionality<br/>\u2022 Supports arrow keys and WASD input<br/>\u2022 Complete game - no add-ons needed<br/> <br/>For more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78e/78ea979c010b802bfff0675be0bf53c2_DBQprEF.jpg", "website": "https://www.rogame.com/space2048.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["RoGame Software"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Arthur Roolfs"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
