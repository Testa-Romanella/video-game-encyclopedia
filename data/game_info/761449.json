Everything happens in real time so you need to help your avatar by using your cards before he gets crushed by the relentless attacks of the spirit.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-<strong>Manage your character appropriately:</strong> Act fast but not too hastily, the intensity of the fights will keep increasing so you need to optimize your character's boosts properly if you want to stand a chance. Since stats boosts you give your character persist between encounters, you may want to think about what would be the most useful things to increase from the start.<br/><br/>-<strong>Build your deck:</strong> According to your play-style and the dangers to come, you may choose different kinds of cards to take with you on your journey. You'll have to make a choice, and this choice will determine what options will be available to you when the time to fight comes.<br/><br/><br/>-<strong>Gather new praying cards:</strong> Explore various areas to find powerful cards that will help you on your journey.
