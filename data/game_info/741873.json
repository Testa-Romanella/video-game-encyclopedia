Being my first project in GDevelop\u00a0(well actually second, I did make a game 6 years ago\u00a0using this engine!) I had to learn the quirks of the\u00a0engine pretty much on the spot. Even tho most of the\u00a0\"game\" got scrapped, with lots of bugs present, I did\u00a0have alot of fun playing around with the engine!\u00a0GDevelop has alot of potential and I cannot wait to see\u00a0what's coming next!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e515bb650c5dd08aec2abeb2336c2a63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wheezy.Media"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
