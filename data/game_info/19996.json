Plan for the destruction of all things that aren't awesome.</strong><br/><br/>I, Nika Allen, 7 years old, am sick to death of this world. My parents don't care about me. My brother never takes any notice of me. At school I never get taught anything useful. There are loads of things that shouldn't exist. It's for these reasons that I've decided to destroy everything that isn't cool. With MechaNika I will destroy and eliminate the things and the people that I don't like. I'll start at home. Then school. This city. The entire world. I'll get rid of everything that's boring and pointless, and this world will be better for it. <br/><br/><strong>If it's not cool, it will disappear. If you're not cool, hide. MechaNika is here.</strong><strong>THE GAME</strong><br/>Meet Nika, an intelligent girl that doesn\u2019t fit the world in which she lives. Perhaps it\u2019s the chocolate shake with a shot of cognac which she carries in her backpack which makes her different. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that at 7 years old her favourite things are the transfer of energy, magnetic fields and electrical engineering! But being the odd one out doesn\u2019t matter to Nika. Not anymore. She has a plan to solve everything. A really\u2026 odd plan. You read the MechaNika manifesto, right?<strong>THE PSYCHOTIC ADVENTURES</strong><br/>As you help Nika in her mission to build a rusty weapon of mass destruction to destroy her world you will meet many unique characters.
