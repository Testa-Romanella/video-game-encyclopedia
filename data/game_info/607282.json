When I first came up with the concept of this game, I wasn\u2019t too sure exactly what direction it would take. I knew I wanted something similar to a simulation, but my main focus was to make music heavily incorporated into the work. So, a simulation game of a struggling music undergrad game to be! I obviously took inspiration from my own experience so far as a music major (being a double major probably doesn\u2019t help much, making the struggle a bit more intense than others may understand), but I didn\u2019t mean to take <em>that much</em> inspiration from myself. I guess it just came naturally haha.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But seriously, anyone who plays an instrument knows that it isn\u2019t easy, and being a music major <em>definitely</em> is a struggle, no matter how passionate we are about music. I am absolutely not looking for personal pity due to the themes of this game, just for people to understand that pursuing music is not an \u201ceasy way out.\u201d It has its own challenges, ones you will not understand unless you experience it for yourself. Which now, I guess you can.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Please enjoy! And remember, the harder you are on yourself in this game, the more interesting (and realistic) the story will be!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Brooklyn.\u00a0\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>-</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Concept, Themes, Creation, Editing</em></strong><em>:</em> Brooklyn Boulay.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Music</em></strong><em>:</em> <em>Tundra</em>, Composed by Ola Gjeilo, Played by Brooklyn Boulay.\u00a0\r\n<strong><em>Playtesters</em></strong><em>:</em> My wonderful family :) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T11:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a26af622d678092c74b8c81c3bff92da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bbmarie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
