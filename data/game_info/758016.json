Saying this, the current state of the game is very rough and has been designed to test the core game mechanics of \"buildable maps\" where players have the ability to create their own \"worlds\" which are used in a number of mini-games.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>THIS GAME IS MULTIPLAYER AND REQUIRES TWO PLAYERS ON THE SAME NETWORK TO PLAY!</strong></p>\n<p>Once you and a friend have downloaded the game files, open the .exe file. <br/>Either you or your friend needs to host the game by pressing the\u00a0\"Host\" button.\u00a0\u00a0<em>(You have to Tab to use these buttons :( sorry).</em>\u00a0Then the other party will join via the \"Connect\" button after they have\u00a0entered in the IPv4 Address of the host's network. You can find this address by typing in <strong><em>ipconfig </em></strong>to the Command Prompt on Windows</p>\n<p>Once the game begins, you will have 60 seconds to build your base. Pressing \"F\" will put you in build mode. Pressing \"1\" - \"3\" will change the building blocks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the build timer has run out...\u00a0GAME ON! Shoot the other player before they shoot you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:00:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c16833af0e6153d4feed049ecbc501.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olliechap"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
