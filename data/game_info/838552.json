The art is more functional than pretty, but it does get the point across. I also feel like the game is quite hard until you understand the right actions to perform. Do let me know how you enjoy it and any points of criticism are welcome. Hope you enjoy it!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>You play as a human sent to help out some robotic friends that have got themselves into a bit of trouble.

You can also build upgrades for yourself and your friends to achieve your goal quicker.</p>\n<p>Upon getting the required materials, get to a factory quick to build that rocket and blast off outta there!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>W/A/S/D</em> - Move<br/><em>Left Mouse</em> - Shoot / Mine<br/><em>Scroll </em>- Zoom In / Out<br/><em>Q </em>- Switch between shooting and mining<br/><em>E </em>- Interact when near a factory<br/><em>H</em> -<em> </em>Show Help<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Music: http://rolemusic.sawsquarenoise.com/p/license.html<br/></em>Everything else: JustDevDan (me :P)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:59:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd68b9359c5f2bef3371ab9a8f6e3919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["JustDevDan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
