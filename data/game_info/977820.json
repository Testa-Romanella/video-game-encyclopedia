I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many cats and wool as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 50 art pieces to choose from, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h3>Controls:</h3>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a cat or wool, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h3>Difficulty:</h3>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h3>Get immersed:</h3>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h3>Replayable:</h3>You can restore a small (or a large) number of hidden objects back randomly into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left. You can also use up to 6 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T13:02:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d47d5761daeb690d1a9d07d143e564c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Follow The Fun"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Follow The Fun"], "esrb_rating": null}
