This is far from finished and is not much of a game right now, but I'm submitting it anyway since it's at least not as unplayable as some of my other unfinished projects.</p><p>Had a web build, but it freezes my browser, so I guess that's a no-go! :( I know at least the Windows build works for me. Let me know if I broke anything else.<br/></p><p>===============<br/></p><p>Smash some buggers, see them driven from their hiding places, and mop up their corpses.</p><p>There is currently no winning or losing. Bring the bugger counter down to 0 if you want, but nothing will happen.</p><p>===CONTROLS===</p><p>WASD - Move<br/>Left click - Attack<br/>Left click+hold - Mop<br/>Right click+hold - Lift object (must be within range to do so)<br/>Q/E - Move camera left/right</p><p>===TIPS===</p><p>Buggers take 2 hits to kill.<br/>Once a bugger has been hit once, it will move faster.<br/>Mopping up a dead bugger will bring the bugger counter down by 1.<br/>You can still move around while mopping/attacking.</p><p>Right now I just have it so a random number of buggers (between 5 and 500) will spawn whenever you relaunch the game. Did not have time for proper game states. Regrets. :( Also, 500 may be a bit laggy, but I also found that I enjoyed something about just sitting back and watching the crawling chaos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/420f4c8de6c72f874ad5a6f2655c2322.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jelinib"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
