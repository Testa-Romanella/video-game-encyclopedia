Arena is a fun game for two players on the one computer. If your brother or friend likes to argue with you, it's a good opportunity to find out who is right this time. I mean that better to play game and not to shout each other. Furthermore, the game will take a couple of minutes.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are five rounds in the game. The bombs and medicine kits are being appearing in the random points of the round. You must avoid bombs (also you can push them) and try to catch the medicine kits if you need. If you don't need medicine\r\n\t kits you can destroy them. Each players have five lives and a snow weapon. Someone consider that the weapon in the game is too similar to a laser, but it's really a snow weapon xD\r\n</p>\r\n== Movement settings ======================\r\n<p>\n<strong>1st player: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A</strong> - left; <br/>\n<strong>D</strong> - right; <br/>\n<strong>W</strong> - jump;<br/>\n<strong>F</strong> - fire;\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2nd player: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keypad 4</strong> - left; <br/>\n<strong>Keypad 6</strong> - right;\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Keypad 8</strong> - jump; \r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Keypad 5</strong> - fire;\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/981/981260dc97fccbf731a87265c515a667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ingvar Maltsev"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
