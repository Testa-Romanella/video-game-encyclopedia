{"id": 54090, "slug": "tecmo-nba-basketball", "name": "Tecmo NBA Basketball", "name_original": "Tecmo NBA Basketball", "description": "<p>Tecmo NBA Basketball is a basketball video game that was released by Tecmo for the Nintendo Entertainment System.<br />\nLike Tecmo Super Bowl before it, the game features cinema-style cutscenes during gameplay. There is an option to play an all-star game, but unlike with Tecmo Super Bowl, there is no option to select the players on the All-Star teams. Tecmo also released a version of the game for the Super NES and Genesis, titled Tecmo Super NBA Basketball. This is the first basketball video game to feature an official license from both the NBA and the NBPA players union (however, it was not the first basketball video game to have a license from the NBA; that distinction went to Intellivision&#39;s NBA Basketball in 1980).<br />\nThe game features an appearance from Michael Jordan and all current NBA teams and players from the 1991\u201392 NBA season. The Los Angeles Lakers team features Magic Johnson despite his not actually playing in the NBA during that season.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-25T17:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a1/4a1d750bd6256a65d1fc013e2b2d2f91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["NES", "SEGA Master System"], "developers": ["Sculptured Software", "Tecmo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Tecmo"], "esrb_rating": null}
