This included systems controlling the player, the weapons, the enemies, an objectives system, etc. using advanced Unity features such as the UnityEvent. We thought this would save a lot of time on implementing features, but we likely ended up spending more time wrestling with FPS Microgame\u2019s code, than we would have spent building it from scratch. FPS Microgame was not built for some of the features we wanted to create, so we had to hack a lot of the systems together, working around the limitations of the template. Our code is really a mess, and it would be very difficult to expand the game in the future. We would rather just start again from scratch, without using FPS Microgame.</p>\n<p>We used Discord to communicate, and coordinate our work. We met up over voice chat as necessary, especially after class and on weekend evenings, where we discussed design, programming, tasks, and deadlines. This worked really well, considering we only duplicated efforts once, on the tutorial system, when we hadn\u2019t met over Discord for several days. If we were to do this project all over again, we would still use Discord.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the single greatest factor that affected development is quarantine. Many of us suffered from an occasionally changing situation, which could pause one\u2019s efforts on the game for a few days to a week, and all of us suffered from low motivation and morale. Considering this and the scope of the project, development probably went as well as it could have been expected to. We implemented most of the features described by the design document, but we had to throw out a few of the more difficult systems, such as a system that allows you to modify the stats and effects of your weapons, using different combinations of fertilizers. However, the game is still playable and complete, and we find it fun.</p>\n<p>We used Unity Collab to share our codebase. It was very buggy, and caused us to have to restart Unity often, but we are unsure of whether it would have been less of a hassle if we had used GitHub, or some other source control software.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/628/628b0cdfa098729efb396bd0aa787443.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dwarfmoss"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
