However, this monastery has disappeared for mysterious reasons. Sister Tabitha has to find it and, moreover, save the members of the crew. There is an encircling meta-story. Two reviewers called Shovelware Queens picked up the game&#39;s cart and give it a shot. As the player completes levels, they react to it. They appear at the beginning of the game, and you see them a couple of times during it.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>There are four levels to complete. The gameplay is quite mixed, so it consists of the different genres. In the beginning, it is a top-down shooter. You have to shoot meteorites and also dodge them. Sometimes they drop to you Bible verses, which you can collect to raise the faith meter. There are two meters beside the faith: ammo and fuel. The ammo meter can be decreased by shooting, and you lose fuel while moving. Fighting foes decreases the player&#39;s faith meter. In a case of any meter&#39;s depleting you lose. The next level is a side-scrolling shooter, aimed at fighting enemies and killing the boss. As for the enemies, there are gnarled trees, mechs and spinning crosses. The last genre is a platformer. The player has to jump around to find Bible verses. You do not have to kill enemies, and there is no possibility to die. Although the sections are short, you cannot save or load at any time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/778/778fb5b47d9ef274a8b3c6906c856892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.68, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 894, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 38, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rail Slave Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
