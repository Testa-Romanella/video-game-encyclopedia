LUDO", "description": "Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht! is among the 100 best known brands in Germany (according to Deutsche Standards). Many companies have used the Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht! brand to convey their standards. Its positive image has helped airlines who don't want their passengers to be annoyed by delays and car rental companies looking to smooth over customer irritation.<br/><br/>In the 1950s classic film \"Wonderful Times\", actor Heinz R\u00fchmann described Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht! as a wise and educational game, which teaches players how to be good losers.\" And he was right. In 1987, the Spiegel news magazine declared it \"the nation's most popular game\", which was easy to believe given its sales of over 100 million copies. For over 100 years the dice game has been a source of fun and annoyance for players across Germany. And it is this very combination that has made Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht!

With its rules that allow for getting ahead, blocking opponents and mercilessly casting their counters off the board, the game quickly became source of fun family entertainment up and down the country.<br/><br/>This was all much to the joy of Josef Friedrich Schmidt, who was becoming the highly regarded owner of a small games company. Just two years after the end of World War I, the somewhat sullen looking man was staring into the living rooms of Germans from more than a million red game boxes. To date, the company has sold over 100 million copies of what for many is the ultimate board game, and so often an addictive introduction into the pleasurable world of game playing.<br/><br/>You will find more information here: http://b-interaktive.com<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T03:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ca/9caed6068538fe19770e6f29edc44616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["b-interaktive"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
