{"id": 13498, "slug": "eve-online", "name": "EVE Online", "name_original": "EVE Online", "description": "<p>Eve Online is a massively multiplayer role-playing game and space simulator. The games initially required the monthly subscription but later got the limited free-to-play version. EVE Online is set in an expansive sci-fi world. The player controls starship and has the freedom to explore the in-game world at his own pace. There are many diffident activities for players ranging from quiet trading, mining, and manufacturing to full-on real-time space battles that can last for many hours and include hundreds of players.  <br />\nOne of the game\u2019s main features is freedom of player interaction. Many aspects of the game such as economics can be described as player-driven. Players can form corporations and alliances that can conquer some of the game\u2019s 7800+ star systems. This leads to a lot of unique and unscripted situations affecting in-game politics and economics. Another notable part of the game is that real-world money can be used to buy different items that sometimes can cost hundreds of dollars.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2003-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T02:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/82b/82be203e68d737762846203811165933.jpg", "website": "http://www.eveonline.com", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 140, "owned": 3083, "beaten": 30, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 255, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 356, "suggestions_count": 415, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 357, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["CCP"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["CCP"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
