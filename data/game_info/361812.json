{"id": 361812, "slug": "twisty-chess", "name": "Twisty Chess", "name_original": "Twisty Chess", "description": "<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2019, with the theme being \"Only One\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>It plays like chess, only every couple of turns you can change one of your\u00a0piece's type (for example, change a pawn into a bishop). To make you lean towards more strategic choices with your switching (and so that you don't just switch everything into queens), the time until your next switch is dictated by how much you were benefited by the change. Also, as the game progresses, switches happen more often, pushing the game towards a quick and more decisive victory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly I couldn't use, because of the rules of the jam, a chess AI someone else wrote, and of course it wasn't realistic to write one myself in the scope of the game jam, so until I make a post-game-jam version of this game, it is strictly \u00a0multiplayer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyways, this game has:</p>\n<p>ONLY ONE screen,</p>\n<p>ONLY ONE board,</p>\n<p>ONLY ONE objective,</p>\n<p>ONLY ONE button,</p>\n<p>and it was made in ONLY ONE day, since I can't work on Saturdays.</p>\n<p>Will you enjoy playing this game? There is ONLY ONE way to find out.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming - Nitai99</p>\n<p>Art - Pixel Chess Asset Pack by DevilsWork.shop</p>\n<p>Sound - Moving sound by zippi1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d8a723cdbfe6d2d7804d7c4aeb42580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nitai99"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
