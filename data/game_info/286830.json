Fossil fuels have long since disappeared, as have Uranium and other nuclear resources. Solar, wind and hydraulic power have failed to keep up with the demands of an ever-growing population of 20 Billion. A quarter of the world\u2019s populations have reverted to medieval times, with no electricity or running water. Anarchy and starvation are everywhere.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>In the midst of this chaos</em></strong>, a miracle has taken place.\u00a0 An energy source has been discovered that is several thousand times more powerful than Uranium. A single pound of this energy source can create 10 Billion Mega Watts... enough to power a continent for a year.\u00a0 As we speak, facilities are being built all over the world in anticipation of its retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong><em>There is a catch...</em></strong>\u00a0\u00a0The only known location of the energy source is in an asteroid field in a galaxy millions of light years away.\u00a0 At the core of each asteroid the energy source is hidden.\u00a0 Recent discoveries in wormhole technology have made it possible for a portal to be opened directly into this location.</p>\n<p><strong><em>There is another catch...</em></strong> we are not alone.\u00a0\u00a0Scouting drones have detected a yet unknown alien species that are assumed to be also in pursuit of the energy source.\u00a0 You must use your laser cannons should you need to defend yourself and your cargo.\u00a0 It is imperative that the alien race does not escape with the energy source.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your mission... </em></strong>should you choose to accept it...\u00a0\u00a0Travel to the remote Galaxy and locate the energy source.\u00a0 You must destroy the asteroids completely to reveal the energy source.\u00a0 Once they are exposed, retrieve them and bring them back through the portal.\u00a0\u00a0This is a dangerous voyage.\u00a0 \u00a0Many have tried and many have failed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Good luck Commander.</em></strong>\u00a0 The Earth will be forever in your debt.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/1344a31a5a65c26a6c0f194ddd4b7f8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["smatthews1999"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
