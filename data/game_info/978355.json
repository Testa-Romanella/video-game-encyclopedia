In the game, the player will be able to jog, sprint, jump, wall jump, and die.... a lot. The current obstacles the player must avoid include circular saw blades, Pendulum styled swinging axes and spikes scattered around the courses. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile the casual player can play just for fun to avoid obstacles, more competitive players have the ability to speed run through the levels and gain a ranking on global leaderboards in an attempt to have the fastest times per course. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player is also able to customize their character to give a more personalized feeling when playing the game. Camera settings allow the player to adjust their view to better suit their preferred playstyle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T16:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87b/87b772cc847ad5b7561c95eff438659a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Travis Bragg"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Travis Bragg"], "esrb_rating": null}
