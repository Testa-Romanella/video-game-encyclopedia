Fly in on your helicopter, fight the monsters, and save the princess of Atrius from the evil scientist Dral.<h3>Challenging AI</h3>The monsters in Atrius Star are built upon a concept called \"orthogonal unit differentiation\".  This means each unit operates in a unique way causing you to make meaningful decisions to defeat each one.<h3>Fun Weapons</h3>The weapons in Atrius Star include a chainsaw, rifle, shotgun, SMG, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher.  Each weapon has its own strength, weakness, and cool down mechanic causing you to regularly switch between weapons to survive.<h3>Monster Infighting</h3>If enough chaos ensues or monsters are manipulated just right, they will start to fight each other.  It's a truly satisfying event that creates laughs and saves you ammo.<h3>Speed Running</h3>With each game timed, you can get endless replayability by trying to beat your all-time best.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T02:42:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67ced2f8539360f30e74251831f5d80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atomic-lollypop", "Atomic Lollypop"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atomic Lollypop"], "esrb_rating": null}
