I loved it!</p>\n<br/>\n<p>I've had an idea to do a cruise ship game for a couple of months now, ever since we had to postpone a vacation due to 2020's global pandemic. I wanted to have a real time clock that simulated the schedule of fun activities on a cruise ship so you could pop in to this wholesome little world and escape from reality for awhile.</p>\n<p>When\u00a0I figured out how to get PICO-8 to read the current time on your computer, I decided to make this my CREDITSJAM project! This is a scoped down version of what the full game would be if I finish it. You can only visit one location per hour</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: Use the arrow keys to move your shark around the ship!</strong></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Leaving your room brings you to a cruise ship location based on what time it is (8 locations in total!)</li><li>If you hang around until the hour changes, you'll\u00a0 be brought back to your room</li><li>Walking over the numbered tiles will display the game credits at the bottom</li></ul>\n<p>If you want to use PICO-8 too, you can buy it at:\u00a0https://lexaloffle.itch.io/pico-8</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/864/864fb55003e286ab474f9e75682d9f6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["prettysmart"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
