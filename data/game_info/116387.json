Due to the makeup of the demo, I couldn't cut this out unfortunately, I won't link the store or anything because that's not the point of this demo. It's also a bit outdated compared to the full game. </p><p>The demo is just a single quickplay raid locked at normal level, with a limited amount of items, weapons, clothing and skills.</p><p>Thank you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e4881a87a3f7765747d4046fdc8bed58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Untouch"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
