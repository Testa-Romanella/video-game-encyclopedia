The idea for this game is that you are a person stuck at the top of an office building trying to escape the building before it is demolished. It does have a scoring system, highscore system, game over screen ect, but they are all filled with bugs and glitches. We will definitly continue development on this game and smoothout all of those things but for now it is just a 2 floor demonstration without the rest of the game.</p><p>All of the amazing\u00a0sprites and artwork were made by lil_bean and the incredible music was made by Isaiah Ebert. : )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:17:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a5719e9862b58be1d73e761fd4e1b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["~/\\bstract~"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
