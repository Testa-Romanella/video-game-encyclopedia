It takes the wildly simple premise of &amp;quot;What if everything takes place on a line?&amp;quot; and rockets it into outer space. <br/><br/>Each mechanic is immediately understandable, then gradually combined with familiar elements, leading to an exponentially large array bursting with puzzles, each with a one-of-a-kind solution. <br/><br/>There\u2019s no jump button. There\u2019s no shoot button. The way you move creates a universe of possibilities and one mind-bending experience. <br/><br/>Guide Dash across the game\u2019s rich, clean, and relaxing worlds; Linelight simulates the experience of getting an A+ on an exceptionally hard test while receiving a back massage. <br/><br/>The gameplay is simultaneously unique and intuitive enough that gamers, non-gamers, your technology-illiterate relatives, tweens, rocket scientists, a potato with googly eyes and toothpicks for arms, and even line connoisseurs are all on the same playing field of challenge.* <br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Linelight. <br/><br/>*Okay, maybe not the potato.<strong>Key Features</strong><ul><li>Bask in the soft glow of a world made out of straight lines.<br/></li><li>Experience 6 hours of pure, unadulterated gameplay.<br/></li><li>Solve more than 250 unique puzzles across 6 unique worlds.<br/></li><li>Enjoy a Zen-like, ethereal soundtrack, and enter a state of flow.<br/></li><li>Explore the intricacies of each world to uncover secret challenges.</li></ul><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-03T12:42:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428e583b9fa03a5e2a09198fc5cf5466.jpg", "website": "http://linelightgame.com", "rating": 3.63, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 166, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 5, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brett Taylor Interactive Limited Liability Company", "My Dog Zorro", "BT Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["My Dog Zorro", "Brett Taylor"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
