Play a game of up to 4 people from anywhere in the world. Bot Rush is inspired by Fun Run and Speedrunners so you might feel familiar with it if you have played those. In the game you have to complete the 3 lap course by avoiding obstacles, resisting environmental hazards and using power ups to tamper with your opponents. The fastest wins!</p><p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>Spacebar only</p><p>All the interactions in the game are performed by holding the \u201cSpace\u201d button and releasing it in the right moment.</p><p>How to play:</p><p>Host a game and send the 6 digit code to your friends. It is located on your top left side of the screen.\u00a0They can enter it in the Join game menu and now you\u2019re connected. Once everyone is ready the game starts.</p><p>The 1 player mode (with bots) is currently under development and cannot be accessed. However, if you still want to play a Solo game, you can just Host a game and set yourself to Ready. The game will start with only 1 player, but hey, sometimes we need our personal space so why not?</p><p>Once in game there are 3 actions you can perform: Jump, Color change, Use power up.</p><p>The change of color is used to resist the different hazards in the level:</p><p>-Green acid water? - change to Green</p><p>-Red lazer beam? - change to Red</p><p>-Blue block? - change to Blue</p><p>-Dark area? - change to Yellow to light the way</p><p>Lastly, you will see that there are many power ups place throughout the level marked with a \u201c ? \u201c icon. Once you pick one up the game will randomly give you a one time use ability. You will see your current ability at the bottom of your screen. Each ability has a different way of it being used so be smart with it. Try it out, maybe fail, try again, maybe succeed this time. This is what you can use to gain advantage in the race in many ways.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T08:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff96ce55a8884c9cfca1cb252ddd6b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mnnice"], "genres": ["Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
