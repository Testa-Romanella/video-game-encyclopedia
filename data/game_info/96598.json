Each and every mission was one deliberate step up from the previous one and ultimately intended to test one additional component of a full lunar science mission.</p>\n<p>This reached its ultimate maturity with Apollos 15, 16, and 17. These were three-day stays on the lunar surface, using the most sophisticated equipment of the program, including a lunar rover and upgraded geology equipment. Astronauts were able to do their most extensive geological study in-person and bring back more varied rock and soil samples than any previous landing mission.</p>\n<p>Apollo 15 was the first mission to exemplify this upgrade, left behind the first art installation on the lunar surface, and also proved to be a\u00a0test of NASA\u2019s humanitarian philosophy, with multiple scandals involving personal financial gain erupting\u00a0around \u00a0the mission.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Programming, Art, Writing:</strong>\u00a0Brody Brooks</li><li><strong>Sound Design:</strong>\u00a0Kira Sedayao</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1efecdf24b4c7bc310ad2b6193931d8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brody Brooks"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
