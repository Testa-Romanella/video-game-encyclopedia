You can also double jump. More features to come eventually such as gliding to get across tight gaps, shooting wall clinger projectiles will destroy them, new boss animations to make the last boss feel more like a boss battle. Also the jump skill will be improved as when you double jump you'll spin to signify the double jump and then the glide will move you up into the air for a 3rd time possibly and you can press space bar to let go of the glide or not but up to you.
