Apparently, each species has a different language, with a different word for \"please go away.\" If you use the wrong language, they will get cranky and attack you. Memorize the chart to avoid confrontation. Lastly, DON'T TOUCH the energy ball thingies. They'll zap you!</p>\n<p>As you might have guessed, this game was originally meant for mobile. It's a little side project I made for fun, so I thought I would port it to here as well. If you want to take it with you, it's on the Google Play Store as well. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T03:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f6900cd76aaac45837071f4fa5f608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquageode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
