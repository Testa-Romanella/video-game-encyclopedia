It features a skiing mechanic that is\u00a0used for both\u00a0movement and combat.\u00a0<br/></p><p>[Note: Space bar\u00a0is a crucial\u00a0non-standard movement\u00a0control used to brake]<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Objective of the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are several levels before you can reach your home. Each level contains different features or enemies.\u00a0To reach the next level ski upward (north) to find a mountain pass to the next\u00a0level.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong></p>\n<p>Like with real skiing (I guess) you have to judge your speed and distance to obstacles. If you don't pay attention it is easy to hit a tree, or worse!</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys, WASD or vi keys to move.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Pay attention to the speed value on the screen because it tells you how many tiles you will move when you next\u00a0hit a move key. Use this to determine if you will run into something.</li><li>Colliding with hostile creatures damages them, not you. The faster you are going the more damage you will do (1 speed=1 damage)</li><li>Speed up by skiing in the same direction over multiple turns.</li><li>Slow down by changing direction. Changing direction will reduce your speed by one.</li><li><strong>Space can be used to emergency brake,</strong> taking your speed back down to 1 instantly. This is very important if you find you are going so fast there is no safe direction to go.</li><li>You can skip a turn (aka rest) by pressing . or R. Skipping a turn with a speed greater than 1 will cause you to continue in the same direction.</li><li>While skiing fast (speed &gt; 1) you cannot double back on yourself. Instead if you press the reverse key you will continue in the same direction at the same speed (same as resting).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Items</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few items you can find along the way, often inside\u00a0cabins. It's possible to win without items, but the items will help. Items are picked up automatically.\u00a0You have to move exactly over an item to pick it up, or time it right to snatch it. If you go too fast you will shoot past it. Press i to bring up inventory to use items.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few hostile creatures roaming the mountains\u00a0with different movement styles. You can either attempt to fight them or a\u00a0better alternative might be to\u00a0ski round them.\u00a0The difficulty is going fast enough to outrun them but not so fast you hit a tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<p>This list is short but that's probably\u00a0due to a lack of play testing...</p>\n<ul><li>For whatever reason when you get to your home the end game message does not appear. If you reach a level with just a snowy area with a\u00a0small cabin you have won the game.</li><li>Some of the UI is badly positioned if playing fullscreen. You can still see the information but it is badly aligned.\u00a0sorry about that.</li><li>The FOV calculation timing is slightly odd. If you notice a slight fluttering of the screen\u00a0that's it.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T04:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec0afd0fd358614538eef7c0fbd1283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["potatoerror"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
