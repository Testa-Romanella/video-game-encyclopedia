This is where the idea for a color changer and the navigation arrows came from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make this game, I used a variety of tools. Photoshop was my primary way to draw, and I learned Adobe Animate to make the animations that play when you move to new rooms. I had never animated before, but a few tutorials got me where I needed to be. I learned to make a few simple animations and stuck with that. Next, I went to Twine to put all the animations and images together. I had used Twine before, so I was familiar with it. However, this time I had to do a lot of transforming and positioning of images which required me to learn a bit of CSS. I also found out that I do not like using CSS. Twine has this funny thing where you cannot see local images unless you build the whole game. So every time I wanted to change the position of an image, I would need to edit it in Twine, build the game, open the game in a web browser, navigate to the room with the image, take note of where it was, and repeat. It took a lot of trial and error to get everything correctly positioned, especially the stars in the final room. Speaking of the stars, the CSS code to get those working took a long time to figure out. At first, I tried writing a time loop in Twine using (live:) and (mouseover:) but after a few hours, I gave up. I later wrote a CSS class and animation for the stars.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/53782d7f7f928a929d53cc5287f22f27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MightyMatt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
