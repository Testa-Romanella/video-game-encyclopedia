In Miel, you take the role of a bee girl fighting errant pollutants and the corrupted flowers that spawn them; each flower destroyed makes\u00a0way for a\u00a0new and\u00a0healthy flower,\u00a0which you can collect pollen from and deliver to your hive.</p>\n<p>As with any gamejam game, this is a small subset of the game's plans that I could fit into the time I had. AGBIC gives plenty of time, but I had a late start while recovering from surgery, so my free time and energy were especially limited. Nonetheless, I hope it's entertaining, and I hope to bring more of it to you with time!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys, directional pad: Move</li><li>Z, Space, A Button: Fire</li><li>Enter, Start Button: Pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T08:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d77477a68837282e941ec18104c7f601.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elfi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
