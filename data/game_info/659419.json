Never again will you see someone, slumped in the back of a hard plastic chair, popcorn falling off of their stomach. No, they'll be on the <em>edge</em> of their seat. Why? Because\u00a0in this world, Baseball is the highest octane, death-defying  fighting competition ever conceived. A never-ending fight to the death on a shifting playing field. <em>Will you survive?</em>\n\n<p><em>Baseball but Fun is an isometric, semi-bullet hell set on a changing field. Fight waves of enemies with your trusty bat, cracking skulls and reflecting pitches back to their sender ( It also may be a little cuter than advertised ). The demo contains an endless mode, and will be receiving periodic updates with more content, including bat customization, upgrades, more enemies + stages, new music,  and boss fights!<br/></em></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>MOUSE - Aim</li><li>LMB - Swing</li><li>RMB/Space - Jump</li><li>TAB/R - Restart</li><li>ESC - Quit</li></ul><p>Currently only operates on Windows, Mac build coming soon!<br/></p>\r\nEnjoy the game?
