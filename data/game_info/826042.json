Zombies will periodically hunt you down, especially at night and more as the game progresses. Find and use the pistol and rifle to defend yourself. It gets very dark during winter months so if you wish to explore the night and not huddle around campfires, use the flashlight which provides just enough light to allow exploration. Collect 4 notes and unlock the safe containing the said object. Balance your health, warmth and battery light alongside your bullets as you wont be able to outrun them forever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T09:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1e08bc3b89a24bb8522d0227e5728d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donkerr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
