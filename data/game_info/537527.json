A logical question arises: how can our game differ from tens and hundreds of others?</p>\n<p>The answer is very simple: in our game you not only kill time while sitting in the bus, but also relax. There you will not strain your eyes too much, you are just drawing lines.</p>\n<p>The meaning of drawing lines? Each line gives you the ability to catch many objects. Yes, you are sitting and catching squares. Isn't it great?</p>\n<p>Moreover, the developers tried to add as much variety of music as possible, which, we hope, will please you. So put your headphones on and let's play!</p>\n<p>At the moment of the game release, the game contains 2 chapters, 20 levels each. But with your support and participation, we will add more and more new chapters!</p>\n<p><strong>Also, do not forget to rate us.
