(mobile works too though not so super) --\r\nThis is a classical breakout game: you need to hit the ball with a Boeing 747 and smash the funny clouds. The game has 6 levels; after that it's over.\r\nGameplay: Use the mouse (or touch input) to control the airplane to left or right.\r\n\r\nI'm a complete beginner. This is my first game with Unity and C# after having a tutorial.\r\nHave fun and enjoy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/1232f6980318e450af18d14223141ac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["miketou"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
