I had no real development plan, just the idea ahead, but it wasnt too complex soo i thought that was okay. The Pixelart was done pritty fast since there is not much too it (created with Gimp). After that was completed I imported it into a new 2d project and started Coding.</p>\n<p>Overall this was my first minesweeper that i programmed so the code is probably pritty bad but if you want to check it out, feel free to download the project.<br/></p>\n<p>The main part of the game consists of 3 Textures:</p>\n<ul><li>the main gray Texture, the player interacts with,</li><li>a Texture where the mines are generated on</li><li>and the colored Balloon texture.</li></ul>\n<p>this is not a good solution because unity compresses textures, so if you pick the wrong colors you get sometimes\u00a0slightly diffrent values when reading a pixel. This was only a problem in one case for me so it was a somewhat easy fix.</p>\n<p>When the player reveals a field, first it is getting checked if there is a hole at the given location (checks pixel on the hole texture). If not, the color from the balloon texture is getting copied onto the play texture and the field is reveald. Then the fields around it are getting checked for the same thing, automatically revealing if there is no hole next to them. Otherwise a number gets placed wich shows how many holes are in the surrounding fields.<br/></p>\n<p>There is actually no gui just some OnMouse events wich you can get when you have a collider on your sprite for example. This was just a fast and easy solution wich gets the job done. I used it for example to get a mouse click when clicking on the playfield. When that happens, I get the mouse position and calculate the pixel wich is clicked on (x and y position on the texture). Since I set up that the Textures Texeldensity to be\u00a01 Unit, it is really easy to calculate. This way I dont need to create a bunch of tiles that can be clicked on.<br/><br/>The clouds are getting generated randomly\u00a0by code, creating\u00a0clusters of them, which\u00a0then move with an inverted gravity rigidbody, so it looks like the balloon goes down.<br/></p>\n<p>Thats all.\u00a0Thanks for reading.
