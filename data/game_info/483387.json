Inspired by the theme of \"Take care\" we decided to go a more literal route and made this game about protecting the earth from incoming asteroid attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can configure the settings while you play. We opted for a relaxing, unscaled gameplay loop but allow the user to play at their own pace with the settings on the pause menu. This way you can make the game as hard as you would like!</p>\n<p><strong>Participants</strong></p>\n<p>Torben\u00a0- Programmer / Designer</p>\n<p>Binki - Programmer / Designer / VFX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6011a2e28f236d6b9a07e9307909661.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin", "The protagonist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
