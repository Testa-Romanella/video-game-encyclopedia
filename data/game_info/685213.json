The job is simple,\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you meet the weekly upkeep or you the king will have your head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Items are governed by the system of demand and supply; overselling an item will lower the price of an item. Don't worry though, prices will eventually go back up! Make sure you plan ahead and diversify the production to keep your fief alive.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Note from the developer</em></p>\n<p>This game has been in the works for the past 6 months and it has been quite challenging. The one thing that kept me going was the fact that I really wanted to make a management game of my own. Having spent hundreds of hours on Age of Empires from childhood to the current day, I could not possibly be a game developer without creating this. To me, this project has been a culmination of everything that I have learned from my field and game development, and I hope you will treat it with love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is awfully buggy and broken at parts, but I have enjoyed playing it as it is and will continue to build it. I have a lot of exciting features already in the works for the game and cannot wait to publish it soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing it and thank you for supporting me in my journey as a developer.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T05:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3fa82d3fc8624bb26455f041e3b3466.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adwitr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
