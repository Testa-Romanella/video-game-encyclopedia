For the theme of\u00a0\"Let There Be Chaos\", I made this top down shooter where you can control the amount of chaos in the game, with more chaos resulting in more points per kill. This was my first ever game and I think it turned out really nicely. A video on this will be posted on my youtube, ThatDevHuddy in a few weeks when it gets edited and fully made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have Fun!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>note: sometimes the end of the game will just spawn a whole bunch of the chasers and not go to the replay screen, just reload :)</p>\n<p>note 2: if anyone is still reading this, I'm looking for someone to team up with to make game, I want to meet new people. if you are from the us or have a similar time zone and are above age 13, dm me\u00a0and let's work something out.\u00a0Huddy#8415</p>\n<p>-Huddy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c3984489ecb203f2e732847f7ef3aa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThatDevHuddy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
