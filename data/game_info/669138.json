Added a new enemy type. Spins and shoot bullets very fast, offering quite the challenge to overcome.</p>\n<p>2. Two new levels designed to be very hard. Transforms the game into a bullet-hell style game that will take multiple attempts to complete for all but the most experienced players.</p>\n<p>3. New menu minigame! The player can now move the ship around in the menu. In addition to just looking better with a background, the small amount of interactivity adds a nice touch to the originally boring menu.</p>\n<p>By TJ Meyer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c47adfb9649e84bd34efa1b5fdad542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["meyerti3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
