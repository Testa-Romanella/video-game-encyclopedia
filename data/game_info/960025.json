Inspired by the popular creepypasta, our game lets you and your friends explore the endless, yellow-tinted maze of sterile office spaces and damp carpets that make up the Backrooms. But beware - you're not alone here.<br/><br/>Players are randomly generated as either monsters or survivors, each with their own unique abilities and strategies. As a monster, your goal is to infect as many survivors as possible, turning them into monsters and working together to eliminate the remaining survivors. Each monster has its own set of abilities that allow it to navigate the maze, track down survivors, and infect them with its twisted essence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, the survivors must use their wits and quick reflexes to stay alive. Armed with a pistol and bombs, they must fend off the monsters and stay alive until the end of the round. The pistol can be used to shoot the monsters, and the bombs can be used to take out multiple monsters at once. <br/><br/><br/><br/>With its fast-paced gameplay and immersive atmosphere, our game offers a unique and thrilling experience that's perfect for backrooms fans and gamers alike that would like to have some fun with friends. <br/><br/>So gather your friends, host your own lobbies, and see who can survive the twisted and dangerous world of the Backrooms!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T04:24:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca01fb6a807901adad792341a075591.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fuming Fun Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fuming Fun Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
