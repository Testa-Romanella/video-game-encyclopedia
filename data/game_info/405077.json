However, to open the Mac OS version you need to extract the rar, open the terminal, go to the folder where the .app file is located, and write \"chmod a+x MacOS.app/Contents/MacOS/*\" (without quotes). Apparently there is no easier way to do this when you compile the game from Windows PC for Mac OS. Go to the bottom of the page for downloads.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Description:<br/></p>\n<p>Move the boxes around, activate levers and buttons to open doors and disable spikes. Do whatever is required to open up a path and collect all the crystals in order to clear the level.</p>\n<p>A level design is implemented where you can create and play your own levels. Currently the level design is not fully implemented, and some of the objects are missing. The win condition at the level design levels are 5 crystals (this will change at later versions to allow the player to choose the number)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move with arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Press space to interact with objects.</p>\n<p>Use mouse to select options.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is still in early phase of development and may contain bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music and sound effects were are from the following locations (you can see the creators in these links):</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/timgormly/sounds/170145/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/412344/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/341865/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/akelley6/sounds/453027/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/emceeciscokid/sounds/403372/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/361636/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ScreamStudio/sounds/412168/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ebcrosby/sounds/333496/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/246391/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/akelley6/sounds/453035/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/sounds/341695/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/jeckkech/sounds/391658/\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270333/\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Art, game design and development was created by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:27:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/4394e712b6116253a6c7b88c9b5a726c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["grompygromp"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
