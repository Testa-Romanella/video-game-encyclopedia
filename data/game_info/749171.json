As a hellish creature of chaos and destruction, you try to throw everything your owner has in their room on the floor. To avoid getting caught you have to find the spare key and get out of the room before your owner gets home to find the mess you made.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instruction:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You control a cat in the first person view, and use WASD keys to move around a room, the Space key to jump on things. You can push things with your weight. You need to score at least 10 points and find the key to get out of a room. You win when you successfully clear two rooms.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Team members:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jasmin Liang, My Linh Le, Zhicun Wang\r\n</p><p>Hell Kitty game credits:\r\n </p>\n<p>Music:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/27247/(Spinning Monkey, famous tiktok music)\r\n </p>\n<p>Monkeys Spinning Monkeys Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n </p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Sound effect:\r\n </p>\n (Cat meowing: royalty free)\r\n \n<p>All other sound effects sourced under individual license with:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.storyblocks.com/audio/search?media-type=sfx\r\n </p>\n<p>Kitchen model:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-kitchen-design-1683628\r\n </p>\n<p>Living room model:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://free3d.com/3d-model/estanciacomedor-934763.html\r\n </p>\n<p>Other object models:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.blenderkit.com/asset-gallery?query=category_subtree:model+order:-created+is_free:true\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.cgtrader.com/items/2561444/download-page\r\n </p>\n<p>https://free3d.com/3d-model/room-door-94798.html\r\n </p>\n<p>https://free3d.com/3d-model/3d-model-cats-tree-630987.html\r\n </p>\n<p>The rest of the 3D object models are sourced under standard license from TurboSquid: https://blog.turbosquid.com/turbosquid-3d-model-license/\r\n </p>\n<p>Wall drawings used in the game:\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/broccolicatart/cat-wheel-4/\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.etsy.com/listing/919656044/andy-warhol-cats-pop-art-print-posters?gp...\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.etsy.com/listing/928941156/japanese-ramen-noodles-cat-illustrated?gp...\r\n </p>\n<p>https://www.etsy.com/listing/1079288969/black-cat-draw-me-pose-print-art?gpla=1&amp;...\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:54:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jasminleung177"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
