It is all because of a horror game named \u201cThe Third Building\u201d. The game is a curse to its developers and to the third building. Play this cursed game to find the secrets.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Every college has a haunted building</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game is based on true stories from the producer. I hope I can tell my story. But after all game is not reality. The scariest thing is reality.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>First Person/Third Person Mode</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are two story lines so far, \u201cThe Third Building\u201d and \u201cThe Forth Person\u201d. In \u201cThe Third Building\u201d main story line, the player will act me(the producer), using first person mode. In \u201cThe Forth Person\u201d extra story line, the player will act a mysterious woman, using third person mode. If you are trapped, try another story line. Maybe you can find the way out.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Me and My Team</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are F-Greetings Studio from UESTC, Chengdu, China. As a college student, I am clear that due to my limited experience there might be some mistakes and flows. And I have accomplished at least 85% of this game myself. As producer of this game, I accept criticism. I would appreciate it if you can give me some advice.
