But they can't withstand much.<br/>- The Tank: Can withstand a lot, but mass has to be moved. The slowest of the 3.<br/>- The Normalo: Normal in all aspects, but can still be a challenge.</p>\n<p>The Tower has 3 possible upgrades: <br/>- Damage: Does more damage, what else.<br/>- Attack speed: Attack faster! Same damage in less time.<br/>- Range: You want to hit enemies far away.</p>\n<p>It might have a few bugs or be a little unbalanced.
