{"id": 845086, "slug": "idlegen", "name": "IdleGen", "name_original": "IdleGen", "description": "This Game Requires Java - JRE 17\r\n\r\nInfo\r\n<p>IdleGen Is like any idle game, get items to upgrade and get more items whereas with IdleGen it differs by 1 allowing anyone to add their own resources and have it automatically integrate with the game. the base game will enable you to gather resources and craft other more powerful resources, everything is randomly generated based on a configurable difficulty amount which allows you to control your rate of progression.\u00a0 you can even turn off the base resources and have all custom Packs loaded.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>every button or interactable object can either be right or left-clicked. When the game first starts on the title page W.I.P! start or settings will take you to their respective pages . Resources are shown in the top left and are displayed by level - easier to more expensive. Generators or crafters will display what they do. when hovering on a bought generator Wood to start (Or the first resource loaded) will light up a little bit clicking on it will bring up the upgrade page for that Machine, and crafters will have an option to turn on or off at the top righ-ish area. all buyable items when hovered will either light up red or green, red means you can't buy. green means you can and a tooltip will show up displaying how much that item costs. Upgrades show what they upgrade either speed (Time Per Cycle, TPC) or amount (Amount Per Cycle, APC) in the upgrades tab at the bottom there will be some info showing TPC and APC. Exiting the game page to the main menu is done with ESC. Game saving is not implemented although the framework is there it needs some work with the custom packs.</p>\r\nIssues\r\n<p>FireBird - my game engine has a small chance to crash on startup. FireBird's current release is unstable. all logs, performance logs, and crashes are located in the firebird folder. FireBirds renderer targets the Integrated Graphics even if there is a dedicated GPU performance is still good I just don't recommend going above the default screen size. dedicated graphics the game runs fine. both this game and FireBird are still in active development and bugs will be present. to help fix these issues please upload the most recent crash report and crash trace to the official discord server -\u00a0https://discord.gg/f7TeAbjBZv</p>\r\nModding/Packs\r\n<p>packs are located in the \"IdleGen/Packs\" folder generated on startup, to add a pack simply drop the pack folder into the pack's folder and it should be loaded on startup, packs with issues will most likely crash the game please report any of these issues to me or the pack maker. Only loading packs is very new and probably has some issues. currently, you can only make generators with packs but new types are in development</p>\r\nRoadMap\r\n<p>current release - done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>add packs page and improve on packs loading and bringing tiers to packs and crafters with custom tiers - next!</p>\n<p>graphical update major changes to how the game pages are set up and make things look better and game saving and loading\u00a0- TBD!</p>\n<p>missions and custom missions - TBD</p>\n<p>TBD</p>\r\nDiscord\r\n<p>you can come and hang out in the game's official discord and report bugs to try out new packs and suggest new features -\u00a0https://discord.gg/f7TeAbjBZv.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T11:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ce/4cea66002db760af807091bf861b06d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fluffy9911"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
