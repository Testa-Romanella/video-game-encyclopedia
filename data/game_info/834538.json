We might feel like we\u00b4re only affected by our own decisions. The truth is: We are not! Decisions of other people affect us, even if we don\u00b4t recognise them. But imagine you\u00b4re making an decision which affects another person. This person reacts to it with another decision. And it goes on and on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What do you think could happen? Well, we\u00b4ll never know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To put this thought into an evidence, we present you: <strong>Death Zone!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Slip into the<strong> r</strong><strong>ole of two characters</strong> who might be as different as a lake and a desert. The life in a<strong> post-apocalyptic world</strong> can force you to make <strong>hard decisions</strong> day by day. Before you even notice you might have <strong>affected another person\u00b4s life</strong>. Not to mention that you could easily <strong>become your own doom</strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>We don\u00b4t want you to experience a year, a month or a week!
