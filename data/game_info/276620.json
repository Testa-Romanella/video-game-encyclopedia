As time passes your energy level will gradually deplete. For each light you turn on successfully, your energy level will be refilled slightly. However, if you press the wrong key you will lose a portion of your energy.</p>\n<p>When playing in Arcade mode your energy will not refill between stages. Try to chain successful lights together in order to build up your multiplier. As this increases, the amount of energy you receive for each light switched on grows. If you fail a stage, you can use a life to continue. This will restart the current stage with the amount of energy you had when you previously started the stage. Lose all 3 lives and its game over.</p>\n<p>When playing Endless mode, the aim is to turn on as many lights as possible before your energy levels deplete. As more and more lights are turned on, the rate at which your energy decreases will accelerate. Try to keep your multiplier going and be quick in order to set the highest score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58b/58b5d02e981646f34b19d2155026c270.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BurningOut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
