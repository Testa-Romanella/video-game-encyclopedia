These stealthy cows will go to any length to outsmart you.  Here are some of the challenging levels that await you: <br/><br/>Barnyard Blitz: Army cows parachute in and hide behind barns challenging you to shoot them before they hit the ground running.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Cow: Under the cover of night, only the light provided by your target will help you spot ninja cows lurking in the darkness.<br/><br/>Milky Way: In their final attempt to escape, these cows have left orbit and equipped themselves with force fields to repel your paintballs.<br/><br/>Smooth animation brings the game to life, and stereo sound and background music entertain you as you play through a series of increasingly difficult levels. <br/><br/>Game information and score are saved when you exit allowing you to return to your game, time and time again, at the same level where you left off.  Top ten high scores and players are saved as well.<br/><br/>Tilt the iPhone or iPod Touch to aim the target on the screen, and simply tap anywhere to shoot.<br/><br/>Cow Hunt was inspired by the NES game Duck Hunt.<br/><br/>No cows were harmed in the making of this game, we promise...<br/><br/><br/>Better Day Wireless.
