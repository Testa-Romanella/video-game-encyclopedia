Play as S.I.R. - a grumpy old warbot on his path to revenge. Use your ever-growing arsenal of weapons, upgrades and powerful items to defeat an evil and totalitarian robot league. Grab your top hat and let the rampage begin.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this intense and fast-paced shoot 'em up with roguelike elements like permadeath and randomized levels, it's all about maximizing your killing game. Adapt to different situations and increasing difficulty by collecting different weapons and upgrading them. Find powerful items and use the unique item system to combine them into super items, or even ridiculously strong monster items. You will need to use every trick and advantage you've got: dash or double jump to overcome the pure number - and firepower! - of your enemies. Botlike has been in development since late 2014 and will hit steam early access this summer.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/1087197c3cecd7f8c9cd408af3884255.jpg", "website": "http://www.botlikegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 326, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Binji"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Binji"], "esrb_rating": null}
