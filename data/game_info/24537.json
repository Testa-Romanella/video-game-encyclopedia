The game features a host of new \n      modes and settings which radically alter the gameplay experience: \n      \"Arcade Mode\" consists of 61 Rounds divided into left and right versions \n      with two types of boss characters appearing in the last Round; \"VS Mode\" \n      lets players face off against a friend or the CPU; and the unfailingly \n      frantic \"Time Mode\" challenges players to clear Rounds within a strict \n      time limit. Factor in the subtle differences arising from the choice of \n      \u201cLives\u201d or \u201cBarrier\u201d rules, along with a plethora of exciting items, and \n      it\u2019s clear you\u2019re in for hours and hours of blockbusting fun!\n    </p><p>\n      Add-on Content:\n    </p>\n      \n        \n          ZONE2 Pack\n        \n        \n          Wii Points:<br/>200\n        \n        \n          Available:<br/>9/28/09\n        \n      \n    <p>\n      In-game content available for purchase using stored account funds.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c67f8b0261dd9924dd3bad8adca78fc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
