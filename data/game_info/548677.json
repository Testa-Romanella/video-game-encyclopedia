This is the post jam update version where I have fixed a handful of bugs and implemented some of the user feedback we recieved.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits:</em></strong><br/>Team Leader - Marcel Kolodziej</p>\n<p>Programmer - Elliot Griffiss<br/>Programmer - Marcel Kolodziej</p>\n<p>Artist - Lars Rune Pr\u00e6stmark<br/>Artist - Marcel \"Node\"</p>\n<p>Sound Designer - ces-cimes</p>\n<p>Tester - Gorol<br/>Tester - Dogel</p>\n<p><strong><em>Known Issues:<br/></em></strong><br/>Tile tearing is still an issue, without editing all of the games sprites to give them small boarders fixing it would be very difficult. I tried using the PixelPerfectCamera Component but it doesn't work very well with CineMachineCameras, both plug-ins are designed for compatabilty if set up correctly, but the Follow target causes the camera to stutter (It's a known issue).</p>\n<p>Due to un-fixed jam code it's possible for the player to get stuck inside of the walls, if this happens to you press the escape key to respawn.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:35:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e76/e763a5bd6609c747a9b0d0ac5106b6ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Disorderly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
