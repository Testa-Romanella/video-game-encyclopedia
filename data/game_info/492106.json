Manage your ammunition as much as your fears as you descend further into the unknown. <br/><br/><strong>Death</strong> may send your lifeless body back up the elevator shaft but fortunately your attained improved character statistics will permanently remain at your disposal. Most of these stat upgrades can be unlocked alongside an achievement...<br/><br/><strong>Guns</strong> are your only salvation against unrelenting foes. There are a multitude of different weapons available to the player, either from recently deceased corpses or by getting lucky with a 'shop' floor. Every enemy killed gains you their bounty but be wary of saving too much before it's too late.<br/><br/><strong>Hell</strong> comes in many forms for different people. Personal torment waits for any soul that nears the lower levels. Try not to let the madness distract you as some rooms contain significantly stronger opponents.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T09:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a07/a070e63a3e7313bc1ee1bf8bd44d4996.jpg", "website": "https://steelpeakgames.com/B67/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Steel Peak Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steel Peak Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
