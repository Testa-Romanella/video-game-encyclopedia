You compete against the show&#39;s bad guys such as Thaddeus J. Plotz, Dr. Scratchansniff, and Ralph the Guard through three different playing fields - a Western film set, a Sci-Fi movie set, and the Warner Brothers Back Lot with a total of 72 levels. The game is a version of the familiar Capture the Flag (a balloon actually) and can be played on 3 different difficulty levels. You can pick up power-ups along the way, find hidden areas, and more while avoiding being hit with too much paint or else you will have to take a shower because you&#39;re too dirty. You get points by winning games through progressively harder competitions and try to earn the master title of &quot;Sultan of Splat&quot;.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:34:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98e/98e826aa7f65d7db5cb216c5d00d0c42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EAI Interactive"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Southpeak Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
