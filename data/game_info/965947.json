{"id": 965947, "slug": "spellslinger", "name": "Spellslinger", "name_original": "Spellslinger", "description": "Harness the power of the <strong>Elements</strong> and gather <strong>Spells</strong> to defend yourself against <strong>Hordes of Enemies</strong>!<br/><br/>In this game, you are a Wizard, trapped in a castle, as magical creatures are attacking you from every side.<br/>The only way to survive is to fight back with a vast array of different Spells. Spells are cast automatically, however, it's up to you to find the best Combination!<br/><br/><strong>Spell Traits:</strong><br/>It's not only about getting the strongest Spells, it's about finding a Combination, that will grant you even more Power.<br/><br/>Every Spell has an Element. Elements grant <strong>Unique</strong> bonuses to their respective Spells.<br/>Want to <strong>Freeze</strong> your Enemies? <strong>Burn</strong> them to <strong>Ashes</strong>? Or make them <strong>Explode</strong> into <strong>more Projectiles</strong>?<br/>Gather Spells with the same Element to activate these Traits and make them stronger by getting more of the same Element.<br/><br/><strong>But that's not all:</strong><br/>Spells were created from different beings and belong to <strong>Schools</strong>.<br/><br/>Knowing Spells of the same School will give you the power of their creators.<br/>Harnessing the power of<strong> Fairies</strong> will give you <strong>regenerative</strong> abilites, or you can become as <strong>strong</strong> as a <strong>Dragon</strong>.<br/>Activating the <strong>Phoenix</strong> School will grow your power <strong>over time</strong> and give  you the ability to <strong>revive</strong>.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The controls of this game are very simple. You can walk and you can jump. Spells and abilities get activated automatically. <br/>You need to survive 15 waves of an onslaught of enemies, that get stronger every wave. Later waves introduce new enemies and there's a big threat in the final wave.<br/><br/>So you walk around casting spells on enemies that will drop loot upon defeat. Gather gems to buy new spells and items to become stronger.<br/>Enemies might occasionally drop an item which you can take or sell at the end of a wave.<br/>Sometimes enemies also drop Heal Orbs, which heal you upon collecting them.<br/><br/>Occasionally Chests will spawn, that you can open by simply touching them. They contain loot, but pay close attention, because not every chest is dormant.<br/><br/>In the shop you can view your current Spells in the top left, where you can also decide to buy new empty Spellbooks. In order to learn a new unique Spell you need at least one empty Spellbook. Buying a Spell that you already have, will add 1 experience point to it. 3 Spells of the same kind will make a level 2 Spell and 9 of a kind make a level 3 Spell, increasing not only the Power, but also giving unique bonuses to certain Spells.<br/><br/>Every Spell has Base Power, Scalings (indicated by the respective Symbol in the Description) and the \"Damage\" stat acts as a final percentual Modifier for all Player Damage sources. (1 Damage = 101% of original Damage). <br/><br/>Additionally every Spell has exactly one Element and one School. Your active Traits (Elements and Schools) are shown in the bottom right corner of the Shop and hovering them will show the Bonuses. Certain unique bonuses are unlocked upon hitting certain Threshholds.<br/><br/>In the Shop itself, items can be bought, rerolled or locked (so they reappear next wave). Prices will increase with higher wave numbers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T02:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/203731ebb22b1562ad7055251fb6a58c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sigma"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Sigma"], "esrb_rating": null}
