The sphere was so attractive that everyone wanted to own it, and one day the relic was stolen. This led to a chain of irreversible consequences that opened a portal to hell. And only you, the white mage, can save the village by destroying all the portal's power sources and bring peace back to the village.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Total Dark\" is a classic arkanoid. You need to hit a ball with a platform, accurately directing it to the area covered by various plates. By a targeted hit the plates disappear or become thinner to disappear from the second / third hit. The goal of the game is to completely clear the closed field and not lose the flying ball.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T06:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/babc9822129bae5715250829eb85fab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garage Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
