I start working in a company as a software developer to get some money for my future. But I feel like now is the time for me to take the path I always wanted : video games. I already touched a bit of Unity by myself (you can check the two other games on my itch.io) but I'm 100% sure I skipped basics of using the software as I should. So starting a lesson from scratch felt like a good idea. My end goal is to cross the ocean and work in this industry possibly in Canada (for my french girlfriend), so I feel like taking contact and introducing myself is one of the first steps I can do.\u00a0 You can contact me on my email tiboo13@hotmail.com if you have any questions or just want to talk :).<br/><br/>Have a nice day.</p>\n<p>Modifications :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>I added every other planets (exept Pluto!) of the solay system.</li><li> -Added the top one changes the speed of everything from -5 times to 5 times.</li><li> -Added th bottom one zooms in and out from a planet with the current focus.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Changed/Added some scripts for the new features to work.</li><li>Changed the LookAtTarget script to make the camera position follow the current planet with the angle moving in correspondance with the sun position.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Add a drag on the X axis of the planet when selected to turn around it.</li><li>Added multiple CometSpawners.</li></ul>\n<p>Problems :</p>\n<ul><li>I wasn't able to show a text on my UI with the sliders :(</li><li>I tried to use the real values of the planets (size, rotations, distance) all scaled down but it was so far appart and tiny it didn't make any sense to keep it.</li></ul>\n<p>Created by Thibault Dervin (J-DaWildCat)</p>\n<p>Special thanks :</p>\n<p>Alexandre Lizin for the maths around camera movements.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Rotheudt for telling me to use Atan2 and not Atan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b99cd77568e18e9282f2c16f2cf269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["J-DaWildCat"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
