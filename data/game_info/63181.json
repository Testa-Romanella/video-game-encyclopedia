We make it real with some work, re-design some part and fix our share of bugs.<br/>And inevitably, the magic happens. You can call it grace, sparkle or inspiration but you will recognize it. A new and great idea emerges and the reward is this quiet joy. Our brain is happy and we are feeling good. Truly, we are feeling stronger. <br/><br/>We want to share this feeling with you.<br/><br/><strong>BUILD-IN GAMES</strong><br/>These four build-in games are available (you can easily modify them and add your ideas) :<br/><ul><li>Pop Island (1-2 players) - a CTF game. It\u2019s an adaptation of our first Pop Island joyfully released on the Nintendo consoles in 2006 and 2007 (90% NintendoLife 90% NintendoWorldReport). You put yourself in a penguin' shoes and your team is counting on you. The same frantic capture the flag style gameplay returns in all of its glory.<br/></li><li>Fish &amp; Shark (1 player) - a Run &amp; Jump game. It\u2019s simple game to play and to code. You will swim inside an infinity pool, trying to collect coins to increase your score. The game has one control only, touch to jump. The longer you tap, the higher your fish/ shark will jump. You need to avoid hitting the building by jumping through it.<br/></li><li>Five Minutes Before (1-2 players). You only have, you guessed it, five minutes to save the lives of those you see on rooftops as you pilot your futuristic aircraft. You will fly your powerful craft gliding between buildings, plunging towards the ground, and then swooping back up on your extreme mission!<br/></li><li>One Shot (2 players) FPS. Found some ammo and find your opponent. Be careful, you will win or loose with one bullet.</li></ul><br/><strong>CODE IS THE REAL GAME :</strong><br/>The code is the ultimate tool to create your world.
