I spent about 36 hours on this having never done any kind of game programming, only the very light Minecraft modding way back in 2011 and wow, its a real game. Mechanics inspired by Oats Jenkins brought to life. Single player only at the moment, so force your brother/sister/friend/mom/dad/cat to sit at your pc and play with you.</p>\n<p>There's several bugs atm I can't quite get out: Multiplayer is broken, the are music glitches, game doesn't full screen properly. The music toggle is a bitt fiddley, sometime sit resets when you open the settings back up and you can still make the piece move sound from in the settings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a30c892eae7b740d493c6dfc3a6a22d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Annabellabear0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
