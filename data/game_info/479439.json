Not original I agree but I wanted a dungeon crawler game inspired by games like \u201cBinding of Isaac\u201d, \u201cEnter the gungeon\u201d, etc.\r\n  My rewind feature is this :\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>You start with 3 crystal shards ( and you can collect some during your run ! ) which allow you to get back in the last room you visited !</p>\n\n<p> This mean a back in the past ! So every enemies, every items that you can buy will respawn too !  This can lead to some strategies like : \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Enter a \u201cshop \u201c room, buy some items but you don\u2019t have enough gold to purchase them all,\r\n  </p>\n<p>Enter the next room by the door, kill some enemies and grind some golds then you can spend a crystal to get back in the shop room with some fresh golds to spend ! \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>But beware ! Every room your enter or get back in (!!) will make your player a step closer from that evil floor boss !</p>\n\n<p>  This is why you should use your crystal wisely ! because you can get really early facing a difficult boss ! \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that EVERY doors lead to a random level ! <br/></p>\n\n<p>That mean if you get back in a room then use the same door you used before will lead you to a total new room ! With new danger !\r\n  </p>\n<p>Maybe dodging this littles slimes room wasn\u2019t a good idea when you saw 4 angry trolls waiting for you now ! \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is how I used the theme ! Back in room, high risk but high reward or maybe low risk low rewards ! Who knows ? \ud83d\ude0a\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game is divided by floor and rooms ! (\u00a0Only\u00a0one\u00a0main\u00a0floor\u00a0for the jam\u00a0!\u00a0)\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you manage to beat the floor boss, you win !\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks you for reading or playing my very first game !<br/>I'll keep it update and use review to make my game better and if i can afford some art i'll keep the dev on it !<br/></p>\n<p>I enjoyed doing this GameJam and I hope you will enjoy my game too \ud83d\ude0a\r\n  Have a good game !<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Inputs to play are on the pause menu in the game ( ESCAPE) Or in the help section in the main menu !<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T10:45:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5e8327e0472f297503d3b528b30e3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iknowcturne"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
