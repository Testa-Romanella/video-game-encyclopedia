As usual this asset contains ,vector body parts, a fully rigged Spriter file and png body pieces. The included animations come in spritesheet format but as the Spriter file is included you can easily export the animations in keyframes at 75% higher resolution too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:44:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1f5247200b1263c903f01dd897c47f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert Brooks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
