So you better move fast!</p>\n<p>We tried to bring to life some of the craziest Dreams we could ever think of; changing, each time, <strong>how the Player Controls their movement and surroundings</strong>, with the Intent of replicating that Dream feeling in which reality touches the imaginary.</p>\n<p>We also wanted to give a sense of <strong>Contrast</strong> and Inconsistency, cause Dreams are full of it, so that Users cannot really expect what it will happen Next. Each Dream will soon become it's opposite, but no worries, if things become too Scary, you can just Wake UP! :D\u00a0<br/><br/>We are super glad to join the hackathon, it was a very tiring week but we managed to pull off our scope as intended. Vreaming was entirely developed from scratch, from the scripts to the environment art and animations.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Packages and/or Technologies</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Oculus Integration SDK</li><li>Blender</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>Andrea Cicero: 3D Artist, VFX Artist and Animator</p>\n<p>Anas Ahmed: Unity Developer, C#</p>\n\n<p>GitHub repo:\u00a0AnasMations/Vreaming (github.com)<br/><br/><em>All the textures and sound effects we used are free and publicly\u00a0</em><em>available.</em><br/>Publicly available free assets we used:\u00a0Metaverse Hackaton - Google Docs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/346/34644ac9f86bce889a033a8ee384c1bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["AnasMations", "Scaryplasmon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
