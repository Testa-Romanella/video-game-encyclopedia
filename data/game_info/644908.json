A perfect game for the more nostalgia-driven of us.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The game:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this fun game, you get 20 levels to explore in search of jewels, you can walk around, jump, excavate and drill your way through the game walls and multi-level floors. If you grew up playing master-system games or Game Gear this is exactly the feel of the game - in a good sense. A simple colorful design, a limited number of levels (which makes completing a game doable again), and quick and easy-to-use controls that let you navigate each level without much fuss.\r\n</p>\n<p>As we played around to grab jewels, avoid the pesky enemies and traps, it brought us back to the nostalgia of relaxing with a game. We loved the presence of those \"spikes\" among other traps. We had completely forgotten how annoying getting around those things could be - it took us right back to Sonic the Hedgehog.\r\n</p>\n<p>A bit of strategy and well-timed jumps are necessary to successfully complete each level. Employing strategy and timing adds an additional level of fun to the game. As you progress through each level, various enemies, and necessary tools are introduced. The tools are key to destroying enemies and avoiding traps. Completing a somewhat challenging level is not only satisfying, but you'll feel a sense of accomplishment as well.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>retro look\r\n</li><li>20 levels - which makes it achievable if you are pressed for time\r\n</li><li>multiple enemies to defeat\r\n</li><li>includes cheat codes for those who may need assistance\r\n</li><li>theme-based background music and sound effects\r\n</li><li>easy to use controls\r\n</li><li>keeps record of top 10 scores\r\n</li><li>lightweight on your system\r\n</li><li>free platform game\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>20 levels - the game is quite addictive which will make you wish you had more levels to play.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A free platform game probably more engaging to casual gamers and those who have an affinity for classic, retro games. It's lightweight and easy to play. It's a \"jewel\" of a game and is definitely worth giving it a try!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5edec61caff5f8a9d8498e7c72147ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamerNoodle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
