Referred to as TEOS by students, completion of the program is often viewed as the key to securing desirable positions in esteemed conglomerates like Nora Corp throughout the solar system. While students are exposed to an array of post-graduate career paths, emphasis is placed on instilling discipline, courage, and unity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe program is compulsory for Children of the stars, who will likely encounter their first planet-based experience. Serah, Kaz, and Mia have been successful in earning acceptance into the prestigious \"guardian's troopers,\" a top-tier military school situated on Titan. The trio will be required to complete and pass an arduous six-month training regimen, including complex missions, to earn the coveted TEOS distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAside from their personal journeys, the members of squadron 3 have been tasked with a crucial mission: to safeguard local populations against the dangers of smuggling, illegal trafficking, and drugs. Beyond Polaris Guardian is an action RPG and FPS that features a flexible campaign system with multiple storylines.
