Can you escape before they get you?</p>\n<p>This game is for Decktember 2022 game jam, I was hoping to make it more advanced and have 3d rendered art however my ambitions outstripped my time management abilities which is why the art is... What it is.</p><p>This game was also heavily inspired by Fredrik Knudsens Loren character.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>There might also be technical issues. There probably are technical issues in fact, but I'm out of gas now.<br/></p>\n<p>\"Yo is that a reference to XYZ?\"</p>\n<p>Maybe?</p>\n<p>There are some references to various streamers in there that I really didn't do justice in the implementation.
