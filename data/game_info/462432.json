It was supposed to have a comic style story-line in the cut scenes, but I got burned out on\u00a0developing, moved half way across the country,\u00a0and never took it up again.</p>\n<p>It was written for my kids to play and it's short.</p>\n<p>I look back on this and think wow, this looks terrible! ...Perhaps I'll polish, embellish, and extend\u00a0it now that there's game engines out there that handle most of the heavy lifting. Or perhaps I'll move on to another game project.</p>\n<p>I think I found\u00a0the best description of the game on a website the other day:<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>\"You purchased a thousand square kellicams of land on Zephulor for a new condominium project. But when you arrived to inspect the land, you found that Zephulor has a toxic atmosphere and is inhabited by voracious alien slugs, as well as being full of strange platforms hovering in midair. Now, in\u00a0Adventures on Planet Zephulor\u00a0you will take your bloody revenge on the man-eating aliens who even now invoke obscure zoning regulations to prevent you from constructing more than six consecutive residential units without an intervening common area! Okay, that's not the real plot of AoPZ, but there is no real plot, so it will have to do. Hey, maybe I could offer my freelance services to people who need a plot for their game, the way Funkbunny Studios offers to do the music.
