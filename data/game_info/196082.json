I had intended it to be longer, a full week worth of days, and with more depth to the mechanics. However, two things capped it as it is now: One, is that I started writing it when I was feeling pretty shitty, and as the week progressed I felt better, so the game felt less writable. Second, I kinda burned myself out creatively by running an 8 hour tabletop role playing game this week, mostly on improv. </p><p>Therefore, this is short.
