{"id": 859443, "slug": "shattered-star", "name": "Shattered Star", "name_original": "Shattered Star", "description": "Shattered Star is a small indie game made by 3 action game enthusiasts that tends to combine hack&amp;slash and roguelike gameplay together to let you have the most fun out of it. There is no storyline due to the limit of 3 part-time developers. Just drop, kill, and have fun. We provide 2 game modes including a pass-30-level mode and a survival mode. Hopefully this small game can put a smile on your face :)<br/><br/><br/>We have a special machanic called blessing, which allows to put very powerful skill on any weapon with certain trigger condition. We want to promote player to have different play style for every run and it is almost impossible to end up with exact same build in 2nd time since all blessings are generated with random conditions. <br/><br/><br/><br/>We provide players great amount of weapon choices bows, various guns and all kinds of melee weapons. We also plan to add more in the future. In addition to our powerup system. Each run will be challenging, unique and satisfying. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Shattered Star offers VRM character import feature. No need for mods or any plug-ins. Feel free to bring your favorite VRM character and use it as the main character. If you are a VTuber with an Vroid look, thinking how cool it would be to fight in the game with yourself.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T04:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/129/1299ae28698b6a428a57817b031f1d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HalfRift"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HalfRift"], "esrb_rating": null}
