But, every time a wave ends, a new one begins.</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE\u00a0READ!</p>\n<p>There is no tutorial or main menu so as soon as you start will be thrown into the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no official way to exit this game as I have no clue how to add it.</p>\n<p>There are 10 waves total and if you beat them all you win, the game will just stop spawning enemies.</p>\n\n<p>How To Play:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walk over to the 2 objects that have a price tag and click on either (You will not be charged)</p>\n<p>Once It has been selected you can walk over to the table and click on a tile to place it if you have enough money.</p>\n<p>You can keep the one tower selected, or switch at free will.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Additional Notes :</p>\n<p>I am really proud of my brother and I for working on this project together. This was both of our firsts projects and although its extremely far from being complete it was really nice to dip our toes into game development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was really inspired to create something I hadn't seen before and that's a 3rd person Tower Defense\u00a0 and I thought it fit perfectly with the theme.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>None of the artwork is ours, they were found through SketchFab.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T11:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a578a3f9db8128cca53e366865f56c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YassQueen321"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
