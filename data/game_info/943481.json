I\u00a0worked as the lead programmer alongside our Art Director and Gameplay Designer. In the game, you play as a Comet trying to get back to its dimension. To do this, you must collide with other space debris in order to become large enough to escape the end game portal. Along the way, you will run into various hazards such as solar winds that can slow your comet down and reduce its size.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c16b6fbe86d9e0956ee2a7182548b59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Wilson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
