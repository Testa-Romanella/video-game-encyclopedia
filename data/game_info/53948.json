It starred American IndyCar driver Michael Andretti, and featured the full sixteen-race schedule of the FIA Formula One World Championship circuit (though Andretti himself would only compete in Formula One in the 1993 season).</p>\n<p>World GP was unique in that it deviated from most console racing games of its time. Instead of being an arcade-style driving game (such as Rad Racer or Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing), World GP more closely resembled a simulation-style racing game. It was the first NES racing game to feature an entire field of real-life drivers (although all but Andretti had pseudonyms), and rather accurately depicted the sixteen circuits on the Formula One schedule. Four different cars were offered in the game, however, there were no car set-ups in the game, a feature most frequently associated with racing simulations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c316cf0d46a96685fabe22ccc5b73acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Human Entertainment"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["American Sammy", "Varie"], "esrb_rating": null}
