Do that and you win the level.</p>\n<p>The cards along the top show what your current move options are. Once you've used one it is discarded and a new one drawn. Each card also has a heat number that it will add to the heat meter on the left of the screen.\u00a0When the meter reaches the top, the disaster shown in the bottom left will trigger. They'll get worse over time, so hurry up!</p>\n<p>Squares that have been set on fire can be travelled over, but not stopped on, or you'll meet a fiery fate!</p>\n<p>This is moderately rough prototype made over about two weeks. There's a lot of ideas/textures/effects etc etc that\u00a0I didn't have time to add/a few known bugs that I didn't have time to fix.\u00a0The most significant is that after a new level is loaded or restarted, you may not be able to select any card other than the first.\u00a0Once you've used that card the problem will right itself</p>\n<p>\u00a0I hope you find it interesting at the very least!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T05:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3d/d3dd6ab4ba4d484503b87db8cfa47b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Aristaeus890"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
