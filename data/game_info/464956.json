Time your attacks right, and the arm will attack for you, destroying your enemies, and increasing your score multiplier, but time it wrong and the arm will turn on you and attack you, the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The arm feeds on death, so killing enemies will fill up its' strength meter.\u00a0 The stronger the arm is, the longer reach it has, but the more likely it is that the arm will turn on you. (the time window for you to succeed your attacks is smaller).</p>\n<p>When the meter is filled all the way up, it will send the arm into a killing frenzy where it pounds the ground around you killing everything in sight. You need to put in a key combination in order to regain control, before its too late, and the arm ends up killing you completely.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T07:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86c7504a16a163efafe786ec455c7e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zicrus"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
