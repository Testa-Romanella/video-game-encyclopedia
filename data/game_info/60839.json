The color of each new square is randomly chosen from among the colors of squares already on the board. The only guarantee is that you won't get the same color twice in a row (unless that's the only color left).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe difficulty of the game can be changed by adjusting the number of colors in use and the dimensions of the game board. There is also an alternate color palette to assist colorblind players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c7eaa4636eb089d3d7a9e508fa6829e.jpg", "website": "https://racingthought.com/chromasquares/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Racing Thought Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Racing Thought Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
