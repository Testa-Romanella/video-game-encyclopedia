God knows the real world is horrible enough right now! So, if you don't feel like something like that, please don't play!! It'll still be here later!</p>\n\n<p>Blurb:</p>\n<p>Your first night working under the new restrictions, but you've been a delivery driver for a while now. This city has been changing for the worst... It should come second hand, and you'll be done before you know it, and you can go to sleep and wake up tomorrow not thinking about it, and carry on.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>This game is played with the mouse. Click on your phone to bring it up, click away from it to put it away. Use right click to look around. You interact with the world through your phone: click on the map to set destinations, answer phone calls, accept new orders and make deliveries.
