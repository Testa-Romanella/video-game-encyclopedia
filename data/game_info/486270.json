Players start with a Deck of Cards and a 3 x 3 Garden Tile Grid. Each Week, players draw 5 cards from their Draw Deck to make a Hand. These cards can be Plant Cards and Action Cards. Plant Cards are placed onto a Garden Tile in order to grow to their next stage.\u00a0 Action Cards provide Plants with a combination of Light, Water and Care to help their growth.<br/></p>\n<p>Once a Plant Card has reached Maturity, they score the player some points and give some benefits.\u00a0 The player may discard Cards from Hand to gain Effort which is used to acquire new Cards from the Shed and new Tiles in the Garden. Once a player has completed all their moves, they can hit the End Week button and see how their Garden grows. <br/></p>\n<p>Play continues until the end of the season (Week 20) at which point their total Score is tabulated. You can continue playing in Endless Mode after that :)<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>This is a game played entirely with the Mouse.<br/></p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button Click: Select a Card / Select a Tile / Acquire a Card / Discard Card</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button Drag: Move the Camera<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Swarnava Banerjee (@mythbuilder) - Code, Design, Art<br/></p>\n<p>Isiah Brighton (@IsiahGames) - Code, Design, Music<br/><br/>Made in Unity Engine 2019.4.4f1</p>\n<p>Using free Assets from Alexander Zotov, Akili Mum, Hanna Fiani, Kenney Asset Pack, PacDV Free Sound Effects, NoiseforFun.com, Orange Free Sounds, somepx, game-icons.net</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acb13412fd8452efaf66308cf926adfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MythAtelier"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
