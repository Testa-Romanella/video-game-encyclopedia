Vengeance Demons V is inspired by the minigame in Final Fantasy XV called Justice Monster V with my main thought\u00a0 being \"what if this was 3D?\"</p>\n<p>The player is controlled with the arrow keys to move left or right and Space is used to launch upwards towards the enemies. The player can only be controlled while on the launch zone. Points are earned by hitting the pots and killing enemies. Killing enemies will also give you extra time</p>\n<p>There are only 5 waves and if all the enemies are defeated in the time limit then your final score is calculated with a time bonus.</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects:</p>\n<ul><li>Synty Studios</li></ul>\n<p>Environment Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>Ultimate Low Poly Dungeon - Broken Vector</li><li>Low Poly Dungeons Lite - JustCreate</li><li>Simple Gems Ultimate Animated Customizable Pack - AurynSkay</li></ul>\n<p>Character Assets:</p>\n<ul><li>RPG Hero PBR HP Polyart - Dungeon Mason</li><li>RPG Monster Duo PBR Polyart - Dungeon Mason</li><li>Dragon the Soul Eater and Dragon Boar - Dungeon Mason</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:07:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e51/e51cf57aa0a193541abd6c8b6156e0dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emelen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
