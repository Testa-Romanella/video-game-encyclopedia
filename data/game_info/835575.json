As the game progresses, enemy troops will move faster. Certain enemy forces have some tricks to keep in mind:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Knights halt for a second after they enter the screen, then charge.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Horses run wildly but have no rider, making them harmless., but distracting.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Wizards summon two illusions by their side to trick you, but the true foe does not move vertically and the phantoms are dispelled upon crossing the middle of the window.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Dragons spit balls of fire either straight ahead or angled. Do not touch! After a few seconds, the beast will charge and its weak flesh will be vulnerable.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Because of the experimental visuals, this game may run poorly. Press any key (excluding the numbers 1-9) to switch to a low-graphics mode for better performance</strong><strong>. There is an indicator in the top-left corner that will flash when framerate dips below 25 FPS.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Pressing any of the number keys will advance the game forward, so that you can see what gameplay would look like with horses flying like airplanes and dragons breathing like flamethrowers.</p>\n<p>Consider this game more of a tech demo than a final product. It was born of a strange idea I had: what if the pixels on-screen weren't regular rectangles, but instead were nonuniform polygons? This evolved into the stained glass aesthetic. The effect is done by drawing all normal game graphics to an off-screen canvas and then re-drawing them to the main canvas using an array to redirect each pixel to a new location. The redirect and the leading texture are generated using Voronoi polygons and Worley noise (super cool - I recommend looking those things up). There are some problems with this look, such as the super low resolution (32px by 32px), but I think the final product turned out pretty cool.<br/></p>\n<p>Music and sound effects credited to the following:</p>\n<p>Background music (Greensleeves) - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Greensleeves.ogg</p>\n<p>Background noise - https://freesound.org/people/shaunoboyle/sounds/472647/</p>\n<p>Glass tapping noise - https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/318929/</p>\n<p>Cloth noise - https://freesound.org/people/leonelmail/sounds/330638/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T08:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c572c076d1107fcfe43ad0dbca7955a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Real_Human_1000"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
