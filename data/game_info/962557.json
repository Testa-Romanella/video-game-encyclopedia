{"id": 962557, "slug": "stim", "name": "STIM", "name_original": "STIM", "description": "- STIM was created as a college project by 4 amazing developers from Technological University Dublin (TUD), all very passionate about Game Design.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- STIM is an immersive VR game that puts you in the role of a Captain of a spaceship, exploring a vast universe filled with diverse and exciting planets to explore. Your mission is to forage for items and craft STIMs, which are highly sought-after by the alien population. These STIMs can be sold for credits, which you can then use to upgrade your gear, decorate your ship, and buy new machines to speed up your crafting process. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- As you journey through the universe, you'll encounter different alien species, each with their own unique preferences for specific types of STIMs. You'll need to use your exploration and foraging skills to find the necessary ingredients to craft the desired STIMs, which can range from medicinal potions to energy-boosting edibles. The game's loop revolves around exploring different planets, foraging for items in a variety of ways, crafting STIMs using the foraged items, and then selling them to aliens looking for specific STIMs. With each successful sale, you'll earn credits that you can use to upgrade your gear, decorate your ship, and buy new machines that will speed up your process and increase your profit margin. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- In STIM, the possibilities are endless, with a universe full of unique and exotic planets to explore, each with its own flora and fauna waiting to be discovered. The game's immersive VR experience puts you right in the middle of the action, making you feel like you're really there, exploring the universe and making your mark as the most successful STIM trader in the galaxy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T03:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab04a53b83a9645a3c2517f1463ca94f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StimTraders"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StimTraders"], "esrb_rating": null}
