'You are the Bad Guy' was the limitation, so I made a game about being a computer virus eating away at the core system. The game itself is a simple shooter, where you dodge enemies and destroy blocks.\u00a0 Initially I tried developing this in PICO-8, but after running into some issues and time running low, I settled for Game Maker to get a finished project working.</p>\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T03:42:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/8837dd44b3311106b0d5c95871d1044c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
