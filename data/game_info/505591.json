Each character has a Class and Race that influence them to start, but you also start with several Skill License items you can use on characters to give them new abilities (note: as Classes do not grant unique skills yet, the amount of these you start with has been increased).<br/></p>\n<p>There are Toilets to scavenge equipment from, Computers to print out more Skill Licenses from, and Vending Machines to buy consumables from. There are also monsters, and a single door. Do your best to make it to the exit!</p>\n<p>There is no persistent progress; each run is its own thing, and once you beat the boss or have all party members die, that's the end.<br/></p>\n<p>There is currently not much floor or enemy variety, but please try this demo and give any feedback!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79e/79eb54ddfe52ea0af2e8d8f8bc8bd816.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
