Although it took me longer than originally expected, I am really satisfied with\u00a0the final version of the game. The game is also bound with 2 consecutive giveaways, in which I want to include you, the players into the game designing process. The first giveaway has been already announced on my twitter, and the winner will design new character for the game that will be implemented into the game with a patch. The second giveaway will be announced after the first one ends.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>For the <strong>GAME</strong> itself you will just need the <strong>'SPACE'</strong> button and Numbers for in-game menu.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PixelArt - <strong>Aseprite</strong></li>\n<li>Code - <strong>GameMaker Studio 2</strong></li>\n<li>Sound - <strong>Bosca Ceoil</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>I would be very much pleased for any <strong>comment</strong> or <strong>feedback!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>for spending <strong>Your time</strong> with my little project!</p>\n\n<p>Ko-fi || Patreon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1aab2714dad66f5bc09da58ffe94dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jin9310"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
