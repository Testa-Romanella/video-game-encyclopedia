The main purpose of this exercise was to make a full game from start with game design doc (GDD) to final packaged build.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough even for pong I'm not immune to feature creep. The build in the video was supposed to be 'classical' pong remake only, but as you can see there are some additional features like sond or particle effects. And my GDD contains a list of feature for 2-3 months of development.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Pong mechanics (paddle, ball, \"AI\")</li><li>3 difficulty modes</li><li>Simple particle effects</li><li>Sound effects and music</li><li>In-game UI and main menu</li></ul>\n<p>Controlls:</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse for menu</li><li>Keyboard (W/S), mouse or game pad for moving paddle</li></ul>\n<p>The planned features for it contains:</p>\n<ul><li>Multiple camera views (currently it's 3D already, but the camera is in orthographic mode to fake \"2D feel\")\u00a0</li><li>Modernize look (nice models for paddles, bacground)</li><li>Power-ups\u00a0</li><li>Multiple modes (sudden death, squash)</li><li>Multiple maps\u00a0</li><li>Cross-over with breakout/arkanoid</li></ul>\n<p>To be 100%\u00a0honest I am not sure if and when I'll add those features. If there will be some interest in the game I might do it, but otherwise I'll probably put the project 'on hold'</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37d2c4d591b99fc9710c77b15f5c487e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bOBaN"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
