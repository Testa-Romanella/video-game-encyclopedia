Not all the endings have art and text but I hope to add them in the future. The assignment required a visual novel and I was curious what one of those types of games might have looked like if it were played on a Gameboy Pocket including all the tropes and stereotypical aspects of early rpgs such as Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger\u00a0. Due to time constraints I wasn't able to fully flesh out the art like I would have liked as I was more focused on the mechanics and effects I wanted to include. I really enjoyed putting this together and I hope to find the time in the future to juice it up and make it a fuller experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Summary: Help a young cleric named Kudelia escape her fate that was constructed by the kingdoms sacred texts and find the key to harnessing her magical powers to take the throne!</p><p>1.1 Fixed an error</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d8b7a2ed534d51f7ddcee29798437d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ChomChomp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
