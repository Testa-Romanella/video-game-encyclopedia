I made this game there in 2019, but I forgot about it and\u00a0only remembered now. So I gave it a little polish and I believe it is now good enough\u00a0for you to play it.</p>\n<p>In each playthrough you need to survive, so you must kill all the enemies and bosses.\u00a0How? Using your axe, of course! Pressing space will throw you in the direction of the\u00a0last arrow key you pressed. Watch out! After throwing your axe, you'll have to find it\u00a0again, or else you won't be able to attack anymore!\r\n</p>\n<p>Each monster can drop a loot or a helmet that will make it invincible for a while.\u00a0The game is divided into four waves, each wave with a boss at the end. The boss appears\u00a0after you kill a multiple of 30 enemies (30,60,90,120).\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has two bosses, one being a giant one-eyed beholder and the other a horned\u00a0cultist. to kill the cultist, you'll need to find a way to destroy the torches he\u00a0summons. to kill the beholder.. you will find out!\r\n</p>\n<p>After killing four bosses the win fanfare will play; you won the game! Actually, you\u00a0didn't. You still can play until you reach the highest score, which is saved in the game\u00a0files.\r\n</p>\n<p>That's it! The game is very short, but i find it quite cool. Hope you enjoy it!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys - Movement</li><li>Space - Throw the axe</li><li>F1 - Switch fullscreen</li><li>F2 - Restart game</li></ul>\n<p>Asset Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Fanfare music by crazyduckgames</li><li>Game Over music by KLY</li><li>Victory music by Haley Halcyon</li><li>Ambient music and SFX by\u00a0Canari Games</li><li>Enemy Fx sprite by CharlesGabriel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T13:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce861a31841145556aaf5b6dfd03986a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JosVinG"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
