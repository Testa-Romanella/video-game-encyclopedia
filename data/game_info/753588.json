This shows how the bear entered houses just to get something to eat and never do any harm to anyone. I am still learning bitsy so I had many problems with making it do things I wanted it to do, so I had to change my plans a lot.</p>\n\n\n<p>Aritcle:\u00a0https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2524985085418/hank-the-tank-is-innocent-update-co...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e5/9e5e2d6df1c4d03c914cf1e25e4d2eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adrianggc00"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
