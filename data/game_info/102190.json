You play as nano bots, competing to control deadly (but also weirdly cute) microscopic creatures, in a small world that gets more and more crowded as you fight.</p>\n<p>The twist is that you slowly lose energy (attacking or getting hit drains your energy even faster). The only way you regain energy is by eating the small gray energy pellets that are strewn about the dish, making this an action game about strategic positioning and board control in a crowded small world. So go play and starve your friends (or our AI if they're not around).</p>\n<p>\u00a0It ranked 40th overall out of 1840 entries total in the\u00a0Ludum Dare Jam 38\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>You can either use your keyboard or a gamepad.
