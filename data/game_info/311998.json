It's basically Pong where you can charge a powerful curve shot. There currently only is a 1-player mode with 4 different difficulty levels, since this is just a prototype I made in 3 days... But I plan to update it regularly ! Next update planned is 2 players mode (which is kinda the most important thing in this type of game).</p>\n<p>COMMANDS:<br/></p>\r\nACTIONKEYBOARDCONTROLLERMoveUp / Down Arrow<br/>Left Stick<br/>ChargeSpace Bar<br/>A button<br/>\n<p>Hold the charge button until a circle appears around your bar, then release it while holding a direction to dash ! Dash into the ball to give it a powerful curve effect. And... that's about it for the moment...
