Clicking the fullscreen button in the bottom right corner is highly recommended !!!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A fanfiction-game made for Waluijam! Made in Twine 2 during the last week or so of the jam because of IRL stuff. There are content warnings listed in-game, but basically, this game deals with themes of identity and autonomy, and has some sexual content but no explicit descriptions of sex acts. Hope yall enjoy!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T05:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c0ad6c13d4c1679cad437dbf3fb3649.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nixfromspace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
