We are cunning, and we are patient, and we are daring.   </p>\n<p>They are the ones with the claws and fangs and wings, with the rending strength and deafening roars, and they are the ones who were made for the freezing wastes and who hunt there freely.\r\n  </p>\n<p>We are the apex predators.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\nA New World\r\n<p>This is a sequel to the solo TTRPG Apex Predator, a Carta game based on the Monster Hunter series of games.
