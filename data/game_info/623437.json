Adventure through the wilds with your wolf companion \"Monster\" and piece together the events that led you where you are. </p>\n<p>Be ready to get pulled in by the 16 bit scenery, and a cast of characters that will keep you on your toes. Visit 4 different towns, cook, fish, eat, drink, and try not to fall victim to what hides in the woods... especially when night falls. Discover secret places, secret enemies, and try to collect 15 unique fish. Delve even deeper and you might discover where it all began.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T07:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d01e7743a3834f5aa418ecb843cadb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Patrick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
