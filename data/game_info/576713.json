It\u2019s been a year - life has gone on. You\u2019ve survived. It\u2019s over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or so you thought.\r\n</p>\n<p>Yet now you awake to find yourself in a room swathed in shadow, the memories of your arrival much too painful to confront in your uncertain state. The room is empty - save for one thing. A stone pedestal, nakedly imposing. Something wants you to approach.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>And you do.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>On the pedestal lies a lone, cracked jewel case. Your fingers run across the surface\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>DEMO DISC</strong></p>\n<p>Without warning the darkness dies, sickly light flooding the room, and you find yourself in a massive building of stone walls and marble pillars. The air is cold yet stuffy, as if you breathe gaseous dust. A showcase - you stand within a showcase, a showcase of curious remnants of the culture outside this place, of the culture you\u2019ll never return to, and the shapes within the displays sting your eyes like glass needles\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Twenty five horrifying games...</strong></p>\r\nGames:\r\n<ul><li>[ECHOSTASIS]</li><li>Agony of a Dying MMO</li><li>An Outcry</li><li>Apolysis</li><li>Chasing Static</li><li>Fiend's Isle</li><li>Ghastly Goodies</li><li>JANITOR BLEEDS</li><li>Lorn's Lure</li><li>Loveland</li><li>Mummy Sandbox</li><li>Pathogen-X</li><li>Peeb Adventures</li><li>Protagoras Bleeds</li><li>Risu</li><li>Still Ridge</li><li>That Which Gave Chase</li><li>The Chameleon</li><li>The Drowning Machine</li><li>The Heilwald Loophole</li><li>The Lunar Effect</li><li>The Salt Order</li><li>tmOD</li><li>Toree 3D</li><li>\u6563\u6b69 - Walk</li></ul>\n<strong>Note:</strong>\n<p>The \"Demo Disc\" is not a physical disc (as amazing as that would be) as we don't have the time or resources to organise the can of worms that is monetization and physical production. We would need some sort of publisher to handle the money split and production if we were to sell a physical copy. There's also been some confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on any sort of hardware from the time. The demo disc is a free downloadable exe for Windows only. Supporting other operating systems would likely double or triple the work it took to organise the disc.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-09T05:35:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d2/0d2563ef71f6cbaea9b200a69a60a019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 365, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Siactro", "Bryce Bucher", "sodaraptor", "Korpus", "The Haunted PS1", "Rubeki", "iwilliams", "Breog\u00e1n Hackett", "Valerie Dusk", "Ryan Trawick", "Rabbit Run Games", "Cyreides", "DevHour Games", "Johnny", "tm", "merlinogames", "Negative Entities", "Minnie", "Headware Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
