{"id": 841151, "slug": "kunu", "name": "Kunu", "name_original": "Kunu", "description": "In this cute card breeding game, you are a drone who consumes domestic humans for battery! Keep your gauges as balanced as possible, keep them fed and keep yourself powered up! Try to keep going for as long as you can before disaster strikes and you get reformated.\r\n\n<p><strong>_____</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Vou've been assigned to a new human farm. Your function as a drone is to expand your stock to meet your own needs, while providing them with the life parameters most efficient for growth.</p>\n<p>Humans are much more efficient energetically than animals thanks to their high neuronal activity, but they are also more finicky to grow. As for any species, you'll need to ensure food supplies - <em>which they will produce themselves</em> - and balanced happiness; but you'll also need to keep their different cultures in check, and proper understanding of your role to avoid losses.</p>\n<p>Following past abuses, you've been programmed to harvest humans only every two days; it will allow you to keep your battery levels functional while optimizing your farm's efficiency.</p>\n<p>Your series is known for its good breeding results, and the Source is counting on you to establish an exemplary farm.</p>\n\n\n\n\r\nHOW TO___\r\n<p>Every human has traits that influence numbers of the entire herd. For each gauge, there are six associated traits, <strong>three positive</strong> and <strong>three negative</strong> of various strength.</p>\n<p>You begin with ten human cards, and a hand of five. Pick two cards to breed by sliding them to the center of the screen, and they will produce an offspring that inherits traits from both parents. Then your entire hand will go back to the pile and five new cards get picked.</p>\n<p>To consume a human, slide it to the bottom right of the screen. Humans you don't eat have a lifespan displayed on the top left of their card which decreases every time your breed them. If it dies naturally, it won't replenish your <strong>battery</strong>.</p>\n\n\r\nGAUGES___\r\n<p>Your humans will eat <strong>food</strong> every turn <em>(upper right green and red arrows)</em>; to even it out, make sure to keep enough food-producers around!</p>\n<p>Your <strong>battery level</strong> <em>(upper right)</em> will also decrease with each turn. You can consume a human every two turns, and the more clever ones will yield more energy.</p>\n<p>Humans develop <strong>different cultures</strong>, symbolized on the upper left with an <strong>orange</strong> and a <strong>pink</strong> gauge. Keep it balanced or things will go sideways.</p>\n<p>Keep <strong>happiness</strong> <em>(pink sunny gauge)</em> and <strong>drone deference</strong> <em>(blue heart gauge)</em> levels balanced as well! Extremes are not a good idea, as you will find out sooner or later.<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Kunu is the result of our second ever five days game jam we at Itchy conducted in the summer of 2022! We are a tiny indie dev team located in France, currently working on projects like  <em>World of Furries</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest! Enjoy your farm!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T08:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2f252a1e7fd217e1452092c73cc7240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Itchy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
