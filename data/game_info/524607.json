{"id": 524607, "slug": "escape-from-kardkov", "name": "Escape From Kardkov", "name_original": "Escape From Kardkov", "description": "<p>There are two types of people that this game will appeal to: fans of hardcore shooters that want to play a fast and compelling card game, and fans of card games that want to shoot their opponents. If you fall into either of these categories,\u00a0Escape From Kardkov has got you covered. Face off against opponents from around the world in this fast-paced multiplayer deck building game based on the Dominion ruleset. Be the first to collect 20 points worth of loot from the board, or grab a gun and start blasting. Your opponent can't win if they're dead, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be sure to try a range of different builds and strategies to achieve victory and unlock a variety of achievements along the way (press TAB to check which achievements you've unlocked). I've tried to keep the play time short so that you can fit in a couple games on a coffee break or spend the evening sipping on tea and looting the streets of Kardkov as you face off against one player after another.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out the game, and remember - loot is temporary, but Kardkov is forever.</p>\n\n<p>Stop by the Kardkov discord channel to give feedback, report bugs and find opponents!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/Esk4MDMF</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/3346b1e664117efbe3bbd0b1058e2ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FishMines"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
