And don't worry if you are not too confident yet in solving the math expressions from the game, as you can customize your gameplay experience and can practice only one of the math operations that the game has to offer, before selecting more, or selecting them all. You can choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as square roots.<br/> <br/>Each enemy that comes towards you has a math expression above their heads, and three answers next to them. Select the right one in order to defeat them. <br/><br/>Your Shots Count is meant to be a way to practice and improve your math skills. Hopefully in a fun way.
