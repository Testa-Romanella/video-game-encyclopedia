I've been wanting to come up with a way to handle my NPC behaviors in a couple of projects I've been working on, and this felt like the perfect chance to do so. I wasn't happy with just putting NPCs on a waypoint system and letting them wander between preset points, I wanted an NPC system that would\u00a0make it easy to spawn new characters and drop them into a world and they'd be able to figure out the rest themselves at that point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This simple GOAP system has the NPCs fulfill tasks,\u00a0mainly just harvesting crops and dropping them off in a warehouse for now. But it also monitors their hunger stat, which when it reaches a certain limit the NPC's task will update to \"go eat\" and they will go to the\u00a0camp site and eat before they continue to go back to farming. I've also created a simple 'metabolism' stat which helps to determine how quickly the different NPCs hunger bar will deplete every time they complete a task.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently the 'game' is more of an AI simulation, and I was hoping to dive a bit deeper into player mechanics and develop a simple game loop. But I am very happy with my progress during this jam and excited to continue on this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sim Jam 2020: My inspirations for this jam was The Sims, Skyrim and\u00a0Blizzard RTS\u00a0games. My goal was to create NPCs that could complete a set up tasks and accumulate resources, while the NPCs don't have too much personality now, I was able to create a framework to build on. My future goals will be to include a day/night cycle and weather, and have these elements impact the NPCs behaviors. I will also have other roles such as cooks, mechanics and guards, ect, which will be able to utilize the resources collected by the farmers.</p>\n<p>-Excuse the lack of zombies in this early Zombie Farm demo\u00a0:x They didn't make the cut.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca4/ca40fa9c8459501ee476cdd1b334ca6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["terryscrimsher"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
