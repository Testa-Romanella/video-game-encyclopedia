You have just joined the taskforce as a commander to fight them back. Recruit new soldiers and send your best ones to battle to protect earth.<br/></p>\n<p>Game made together with Leonovsky for 7DFPS and PROCJAM 2020. Made with FTE QuakeWorld engine.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: Noticed there's a bug in the released version, when you have a soldier die and the game asks you to pick another one, make sure you actually select a soldier. If you accidentally click deploy without selecting a soldier, the game will go into a weird state and you won't be able to refill your primary weapon ammunition.<br/></p>\n<p>How to play: <br/></p>\n<p>- Check SETTINGS menu in-game for controls. <br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Start\u00a0a new game.<br/></p>\n<p>- Hire new soldiers in \"Team Management\" view if you have the credits.</p>\n<p>- Go to briefing, select the soldier you want to play as, and deploy.</p>\n<p>- Complete the objectives and stay alive. Once a soldier dies they're gone for good. You lose the game if all your soldiers are dead.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d72d55b763776332c12d5e22af495ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["shp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
