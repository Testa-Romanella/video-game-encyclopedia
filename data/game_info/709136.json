Each character can summon his own \"magic\" arena where he becomes the boss of the level for a short amount of time. Each character can be knocked out with one hit in standing in \"danger\" zone. Once the \"magic\" arena is summoned by one of the 15 combatants - the fighting game becomes an arcade while the \"boss\" player is trying to defeat the opponent before the magic arena time runs out.<br/><br/><br/>Included game modes:<br/><br/>- 2x Speed mode - a good way to train superhuman reaction<br/><br/>- Prophet mode - turns the game into a turn-based strategy in a way. Both players blindly enter the string of commands without knowing the commands of the opponent. Once the required number of commands is entered both characters start executing them.<br/><br/>- Retro mode - Pixelated graphics, old but gold.<br/><br/>- I know Kung Foo - AI game mode where the AI is trying really hard to loose to you making it look as cool as possible.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T04:26:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d86681f0299f84daabc15d2ecbf77bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AVOS'"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AVOS'"], "esrb_rating": null}
