Come to our Discord to talk about it, or give feedback :)</p>\n<p>I uploaded a post jam version as browser playable and downloadable (changelog below). I always <strong>recommend to play the downloadable</strong>, as the browser can have audio issues (crackling). If you want to rate the game for ludum dare, best play the downloadables called <em>Karawan</em>, not the <em>PostJam</em> versions.</p>\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<ul><li>control with mouse\r\n</li><li>try to get wagons for all 3 resources\r\n</li><li>wagons have to be manually assigned to work an adjacent field\r\n</li><li>get a magus, spells are fun</li><li>there are many paths to reach the portal</li></ul>\n<p>Changelog for Post Jam version:</p>\n<ul><li>added ingame options to change audio volumes and fullscreen/windowed</li><li>added a title screen</li><li>you can now purchase world maps on some occasions</li><li>added a third, puzzly world</li><li>when losing the game,\u00a0it doesn't immediately go into the game over screen, but shows a flavor popup first</li><li>automatic resource collection available as upgrade</li></ul>\n<p>OST by Cameron Paxton https://cameronpaxton.bandcamp.com/album/karawan-ost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:43:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2aefe4427829692fbb5e3407faa568b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bippinbits"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
