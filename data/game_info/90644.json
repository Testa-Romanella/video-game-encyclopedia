{"id": 90644, "slug": "super-clash-bros", "name": "Super CLASH Bros", "name_original": "Super CLASH Bros", "description": "<p>Super Clash Bros is a fan-made crossover game featuring a battle mode and adventure mode. The characters are kept very accurate to their original games (same abilities, same health systems, etc.). This is an early, unfinished and glitchy version but it's still very playable and fun with a group of friends. I'm hosting a game night every weekend, join the Discord chat if you want to play or set up your own online matches:https://discord.gg/Djcs4J4</p>\n\n<p>Some notes:</p>\n<ul><li>Online multiplayer via Parsec.</li><li>The downloadable version has better gamepad support and performance.\u00a0</li><li>The default controls are setup so you can play by yourself with a character to each hand. You can change them through the Control Mapper button in the lobby or by pressing escape key or pause key. You should play with a gamepad though, just about every gamepad is supported in the downloadable\u00a0 version.</li><li>Mario/Luigi can get\u00a0 Yoshi via the item bubbles under certain conditions. Yoshi can't eat Bowser\u00a0but Bowser can't ride Yoshi.</li><li>When you die you come back as a ghost. They're not tracked yet by the camera zoomer/positioner, so you won't be able to see the ghosts if they're too far away.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>That's all for now, let me know any feedback you have. You can follow progress on\u00a0the Discord server (watch the #live-change-log channel to see the changes I\u00a0make as I make them).<br/></p>\n<p>If you subscribe to my\u00a0Youtube channel, click that bell right after you subscribe so you can be notified of new videos.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518859e318c2f9aaa6b318269e279e65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ClashDev_Ato"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
