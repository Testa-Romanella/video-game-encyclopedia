To beat each level, you must repair all of the transparent blocks to make them solid again.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no end-game at the moment, but each level will increase in size (adding more enemies, etc.)\u00a0 This was really fun to work on, I'd love to actually make more enemies, improve level generation, and add more features and polish!
