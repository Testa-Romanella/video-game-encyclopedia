I made this horrible fighting game based on my Megaman In a Nutshell series using Game Maker Studio with\u00a0 \u00a0pretty much no experience with the software, as you can tell just by looking. \u00a0I created this using a game maker engine I have long since forgot the name of. \u00a0I am moving this game to itch.io since it's a safer and more suitable place to upload it, and since this is where I intend to release the mugman rpg when it comes out. Don't worry, I know how bad this is. Controls are included in a text file with the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a91/a91d714d2c0193825fd1f43a9f833052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kain128"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
