It\u2019s a premium edition, so it's eligible for family sharing, and education volume discounts.  It\u2019s packed with trait tips that give real life examples of the various traits in nature. It has easy account switching to allow classes of students to play on the same machine, and it has chat disabled to keep students safe if they choose to play online. <br/><br/>In Evolution, you selectively develop species for survival while avoiding the looming threat of extinction. Adaptability is key as each situation has a number of successful pathways to survival. Food supply running low? Grow a long neck to access vegetation in the trees high above. Each trait added shows realistic effects on ecosystems that mirror those of the natural world. An overabundance of plant food leads to overpopulation, which in turn leads to an increase in carnivores. Of course, with many meat-eaters on the prowl, other species will develop defenses in turn. Explore the effects natural selection has on both the environment and the creatures living within.<br/><br/>Designed for students age 12 and above, and enjoyed by millions of adults worldwide, the game is easy to pick up with a learn-while-playing tutorial. From there, explore the mysterious creatures of Evolution Island as students progress through 21 different ecosystems, playing creatures with different strategies for survival.<br/><br/>Students will even see beautiful drawings of one of the creatures they created at the end of their games. The game features lots of great content across singleplayer and multiplayer modes. The campaign teaches them how to play and guides them through the basic strategies.  A new challenge arrives every week to test a student\u2019s skill at adapting, or students can play against each other in pass and play or the online multiplayer mode.  <br/><br/>Teachers &amp; Parents: visit our website at www.evolutionvideogame.com\\education for lesson plans and resources on using the Evolution Board Game in the classroom.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4e93ccd690f4930ef00a3b91144ccca.jpg", "website": "https://evolutionvideogame.com/education/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 414, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["North Star Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card", "Educational"], "publishers": ["North Star Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
