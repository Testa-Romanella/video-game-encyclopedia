The web build is a bit annoying.</p>\n\n<p>This game is an arcade game, where you try to survive as long as possible. You lose once any of the dice buildings get down to tier one. You win if you manage to survive for a VERY long time. <br/></p>\n<p>Beware the game can soft lock you off spawn, I left it in because I thought it was funny. If it happens you can just go back to the main menu, then back into the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Controls]</strong></p>\n<p>WASD or arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Move into a building to load / unload dice<br/></p>\n<p>Escape to enter/exit menus<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Tutorial]</strong></p>\n<p>The building in the center is the dice factory, you can pick up dice from it by walking into it. After you do this they are stored in your inventory. You can use those dice to increment buildings up one tier. Keep doing this to survive.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Credits]<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Font - Roboto</p><p>Colors -Cold Light by A_Lamp<br/></p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Ambient music - Sounds provided by Erokia/Jordan Powell from Freesound.org</p>\n<p>Crickets - Sounds provided by caquet from Freesound.org<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>[Tools]</strong></p>\n<p>Aseprite</p>\n<p>Audacity<br/></p>\n<p>Unity<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:24:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/60510ae1dedfbb74769ff694fef7f05e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["oxnh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
