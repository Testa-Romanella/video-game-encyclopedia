How Can I Have the Heroes Trained?</h3>There are several ways to increase the chance of training. It is especially helpful if the hero has bought an experience potion (yellow potion) beforehand. The chance of training is also increased if the hero can defeat a high level monster or defeats several monsters.<h3>2. How Can I Have A Hero Blessed?</h3>A hero wants to be blessed after having his suffering (e.g. diseases caused by undead monsters) treated in the temple. The different blessings are only valid for certain races. So in the beginning only one blessing is available for elves and it can be helpful to attract as many elves as possible to the village.<h3>3. How Can I Delete Or Reposition A Building?</h3>Select a building and open the building menu with the button in the upper left corner. Select \"Store building\". If you now want to move this building somewhere else, click on an empty field and select the building from your storage.<h3>4. Can I find improvements in treasure chests for employees who cannot be found in treasure chests?</h3>As soon as an employee is on your team, you can find improvements in treasure chests with the same probability.<h3>5. I can't get any further with the task \"In your village you need 10 cats\" and need a tip?</h3>This task can only be solved at level 28. Once you have cats in your village, remember that all cats need love.
