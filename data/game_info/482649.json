{"id": 482649, "slug": "dog-gone-2", "name": "Dog Gone", "name_original": "Dog Gone", "description": "<p>First time creating a mini-game in unity. Dog gone follows the story of a lost dog who is in search of his owner. He stumbles into a graveyard where he has to outlast various undead enemies.</p><p><strong>Game Overview</strong><br/></p><p>The goal of Dog Gone is simple with the player being challenged to survive as long as possible whilst avoiding enemies and trying to shoot them down with their ball. Enemies will spawn and a player must avoid being tagged, if tagged then the player will lose a life, the game will end when all lives have been lost.</p>\n<p>The player has basic tank controls adding a further challenge for them to survive, they also have the ability to throw balls at enemies but each time there is a slight cooldown so the player can\u2019t just rapid fire at their enemies.</p>\n<p>In addition to difficult controls the player is presented with 3 different enemy types, all ranging in difficulty; with one enemy stationary that fires projectiles and another 2 enemies that will move across the play area and chase the main character. The game is set within a cemetery and utilises design elements such as audio and characters to help carry a sinister theme. The cartoon design choices will aid in a typical player experience that will be fun and enjoyable, whilst the player is challenged against a range of difficult enemies.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58d/58ddac90b02226220eb56908d506955d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jparsons"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
