His actions will influence the development of the rest of the game. The final number of each type of effort must be noted on the two other cards.</p>\n<p>The second sheet is The Working Class Goes to Heaven? in which a worker finds himself amid conflicts between landowners and subversives. What choice will he make? How will the owner act? The choices will finally affect the last record, as the owner will be able to transfer the internal effort to the external effort to reach a negotiation with the worker.</p>\n<p>The third card is Tropical Paradise, in which a native sees his form of existence at risk from the actions of the metropolis. There is no possibility of transferring effort markers.</p>\n<p>The game aims to present the intensities that\u00a0conflicts can assume, how their consequences are different, as well as the\u00a0possibilities of dialogue.\u00a0Not all conflicts are open to negotiation and not all\u00a0conflicts will produce deaths.</p>\n<p>Assuming these particularities, the game was\u00a0designed to offer an asymmetrical experience, in\u00a0which actions have consequences in other places\u00a0that are invisible in the daily life of those who act.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T10:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0844bea0506aa4c7d63265b66b6070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rafael Carneiro Vasques"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
