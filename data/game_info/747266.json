It's the exact same game:\u00a0https://itch.io/game/edit/1419499#publishe<br/></p>\n<p>Your mission is to steal the gold chests and get out of there. Shooting will be penalized when your superiors give you a rating after you finish a heist.<br/><br/>The enemies are equipped with flashlights and if you come to close to them or get spotted by the other lights they'll start a search action. Getting spotted during the search action will prove fatal to your cause.</p>\n<p>Each mission will bring new challenges, expect everything you've learned to not be true in your next mission. There is a reason after all that no-one believes they're real.</p>\n<p>Don't get spotted, don't get killed, preserve ammo, be as fast as you can and make sure to bring the gold home!<br/><br/>Report your rating card of a heist you're proud of, to the observes lurking in the shadow of the comment section.<br/><br/>I've done everything my self - code, art, design and music. The sound effect are the only thing I haven't done :)<br/><br/>All the levels can be completed without firing a single shot - of course if you're up to the challenge.<br/><br/>I'll be playing game jam games on stream\u00a0and you can check me out on other socials if you like the game, I appreciate you all a lot!\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2aeeb6c45ae2d5ccb40e864d4b7f7abd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BuckySide"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
