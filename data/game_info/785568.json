The main character is a sacrificed child that the spirits of the forest turn into a mushroom and bless with the powers of the forest to defeat the cultists and stop the destruction they are causing in the forest. The mood of the game is a combination of cute and creepy.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Roguelike means that \u201cthe rooms\u201d the player encounters are randomly generated. Every time you play the game you get a slightly different gaming experience, which makes it very replayable. In the rooms you fight demons, find different items and valuables to progress further in the game. The money can be exchanged for items in a separate shop room that the player comes across before the harder enemy rooms start. The further the player gets in the game, the more enemies and collectable items they unlock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The online multiplayer option is currently not working.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T19:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a7273ed4ae6bef4fb629b02b1f0cf4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
