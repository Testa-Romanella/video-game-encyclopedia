We wrote down nearly every name in the bookstore\u2019s fantasy section!<br/>2. We made up some more for comic relief.<br/>3. We took the best 3,300 names and sorted them.<br/>4. We commissioned art from Maggie Parr.<br/>5. We published a book and sold it mail-order through Dragon Magazine \u2122.<br/>4. We made this app (20 years later).<br/><br/>With this app, you can:<br/><br/>- Easily browse the 3,300 fantasy names with the spinner<br/>- Shake to find a random name for a particular character type <br/>- Save, organize, and email your favorite names<br/><br/>The names are sorted into Male and Female for each of the following categories:<br/><br/>Fighter<br/>Wizard<br/>Healer<br/>Rogue<br/>Elf<br/>Dwarf<br/>Halfling<br/>Gnome<br/>Monster<br/><br/>NOTE: We sorted the names subjectively. You should use each name however you see fit. For that matter, pronounce them however you want too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4e/e4ede5205b413efa232bcacf8cea98cb.jpg", "website": "http://www.epicdeeds.com/fantasy_names.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rogue Sword: Strategy & Adventure Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Rogue Sword: Strategy & Adventure Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
