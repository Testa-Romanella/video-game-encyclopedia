I made it all by myself, the only asset I used was smoke particles. Sound effects and music from \"https://freesound.org/\". Everything else was made within the game jam's time frame. That is my first game jam. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>There might be some problems with the achievement system (I haven't tested it yet) (Achievements should be white when you achieve them and red when you haven't achieved them). Report anything that seems like a bug in the comments of the game or email me on\u00a0support_baiji@gmail.com. I do check every email!
