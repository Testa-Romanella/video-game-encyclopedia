The Antivirus enemy uses the player sprite from my Antivirus game (unpublished) from a game jam in 2016. The Quatro enemy uses the AI from a game I worked on, Hue Will\u00a0Die (published for the Global Game Jam 2017). The Quatro sprite was reworked to fit the art style of Mainframe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T03:47:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f4/1f40b89a88d585c53a773f7f145a4774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Suri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
