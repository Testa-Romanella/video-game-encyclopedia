Keep in mind that the multiplayer is broken right now, and only the single player and the local 2 player modes work at the moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I mainly created this game just to test my current knowledge and see if I can make a simple game from finish to start. And I also wanted to learn about networking, but I still have a lot to learn since the multiplayer has\u00a0problems\u00a0 syncing the paddles movement. I might try some day to make another simple game like this, who knows. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T07:55:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a78/a7851e330dd7c496b338a93701fdac36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabe"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
