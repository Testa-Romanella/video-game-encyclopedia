With your earnings, you can purchase upgrades to make your job easier. Using only two colors - light and dark- as well as\u00a0the humble square and the modest circle, you will create (or imitate) true\u00a0masterpieces of our time!</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sorry for no tutorial! Click on the paint buckets to choose whether to paint with the circle or square tool, or use the X and C keys respectively. Drawing a shape inverts whatever is behind it, use this to save time when drawing!</p>\n<p>You need to purchase the undo upgrade from the store (pull down on the tab thingy). Then you can undo/redo with the button or CTRL+Z.</p>\n<p><strong>Made for YeegJam V.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:40:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/094e7f4a8e719ed747a30887213b1a8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Apollogeist"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
