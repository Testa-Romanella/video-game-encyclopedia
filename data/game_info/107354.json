{"id": 107354, "slug": "void-wisp-itch", "name": "Void Wisp (itch)", "name_original": "Void Wisp (itch)", "description": "Void Wisp is an ambient arcade runner where you earn points by coming close to obstacles without crashing. \r\n<p>\r\n\tYou are a wisp. A collection of random energy that has coalesced into a sentient form. You float through the great nothingness that permeates existences, skimming off aether from the whatever that is nearby.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe gameplay is simple. You have two buttons; one moves you up and the other lets you glide. Typically you'll be holding the glide button to slow your descent when an obstacle comes near so you can grind along the top or bottom for points. The closer you are the more points you'll earn. You'll crash if the center of the Wisp contacts an obstacle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBelow is a short overview of how this game works.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n Features:\r\n<ul><li>Simple gameplay that\u2019s easy to pick up and hard to master. Designed for both short spurts and long sessions.\u00a0</li><li>4 Game Modes each with a unique twist.\r\n<ul><li>In Classic Mode you\u2019ll start to lose points the farther you go, so you want to get as many as quickly as possible.</li><li>In Caravan Mode you have one minute to score as much as possible.
