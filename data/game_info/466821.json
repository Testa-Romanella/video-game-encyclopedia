Hold down the mouse to stay connected for longer, and use the momentum from that swing to try to direct Rico to where you want to go! Good luck, it'll be a bit of a fight against gravity and chaos to get this cat moving in the right direction. Try your best, and remember to aim for the score multipliers at the end.</p>\n<p>Chase a highscore!</p>\n\n<p>A Game by<br/></p>\n<p>Will Warren, Garrett Hobson and Matt Parker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eefadbf726c988d54d1e343dfec7c460.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["BoredSkeleton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
