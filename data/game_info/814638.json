After spraying her prize cabbages with some experimental fertiliser (she knew she should have stayed organic!) Gertie now has to beat back the brutish brassica using only her handy spray backpack and good, old-fashioned gumption. <br/><br/>You guide Gertie (with a joystick in port 2) around her once beautiful garden. That backpack is pretty heavy but Gertie can move at a pace when it counts. None of this spinning around, though. That\u2019s for the young folk. <br/><br/>Hold down fire to stand your ground and unleash a torrent of \u201cspecial blend\u201d at the marauding Cabbages as they march towards Gertie\u2019s cabbage patch. Spray them long enough and they\u2019ll slow down (though will always creep ever-onwards, wanting nothing more than to eat the flesh of their own leafy kind). Keep spraying and they\u2019ll swell up (silly Cabbages can\u2019t keep their mouths closed!). KEEP spraying and the Cabbage explodes! Yes! That\u2019s showing \u2018em, Gertie! <br/><br/>If a Mutant Cabbage gets to a cabbage in the cabbage patch it munches on one and then wanders off, content. <br/><br/>But even though these voracious vegetables only want to snack on other leafy greens doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t give Gertie a good thumping. Get too close and Gertie will get knocked down, wasting precious seconds while she finds her lost false teeth. <br/><br/>Pop 50 Mutant Cabbages and the rest scarper, leaving Gertie to watch the lovely, errr \u2026 purple \u2026 sunset. <br/><br/>Have all 16 cabbages gobbled up and Gertie drops to the ground in despair, wondering how she\u2019s going to make her award-winning cabbage chutney for the next village fair. <br/><br/>HINTS and TIPS <br/>\u25cf Mutant Cabbages will only eat one cabbage <br/>\u25cf Slow down fast Cabbages to give you time to pop other Cabbages <br/>\u25cf Get a good blast right in the Cabbage\u2019s mouth and they won\u2019t be able to eat any cabbages <br/>\u25cf If a Cabbage under fire gets too close to Gertie she panics a bit and her shot goes astray <br/>\u25cf The screen border changes colour as the difficulty slowly increases <br/>\u25cf It\u2019s fairly easy to finish the game with one cabbage remaining. Try and see how many cabbages you have left in your patch and then try and beat that score\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Vanja Utne for her wonderful sound effects and music, and for her patience when I did a silly thing three times; and to Roy Fielding for his encouragement and help way back when.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T12:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c8/2c8fc3604230530411933d9edf4c64d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["antstiller"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
