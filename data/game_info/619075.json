If you stray too far from the surrounding trees, your life-force will be depleted and the forest will begin to die.</p>\n<p><strong>THE OBJECTIVE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Protect the altar from the oncoming hordes. If the altar dies, so too will the forest (and; therefore, you). You are equipped with a simple wand, which shoots pellets that bounce around killing both enemies and trees. When an enemy dies, there is a chance for new life to grow in its place, allowing you to venture farther from the borders of the forest while still maintaining your connection to the trees.</p>\n<p><strong>UI LEGEND</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Yellow Bar -\u00a0</em>altar health</p>\n<p><em>Blue Line -\u00a0</em>the link between you and the nearest trees<br/></p>\n<p><em>The Rings:</em><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em>Blue Ring -\u00a0</em>the time you have been unlinked from the forest.
