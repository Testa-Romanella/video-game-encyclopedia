Watch out for the roof-tops and see how long a distance you can travel.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Concept</strong>\n<p>Gizmo Rabbit was the result of combining a humanoid rodent with random gizmos and thingamajigs with inspiration from Rube Goldberg machines and the industrial age. Some of the components might help you fly longer, while others grant you more attachment points. See if you can discover all the components, beat your high score, or just build the coolest vehicle in town.\r\n  </p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>Use \u2018W\u2019 to drive forwards while on the ground and the \u2018A\u2019 &amp; \u2018D\u2019 keys to adjust rotation while in the air. Some components are interactable with an input indicated in-game, but the input changes as your vehicle grows, so be cautious!\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Credits:</strong>\n<p>Developed in Unity by https://ladane.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics and UI made in Illustrator by https://duendue.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Support in ideation proces - https://chamber95.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Audio<br/></strong></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/</p>\n<p>\"Wagon Wheel\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p><p>\r\n      Made for the <em>SURVIVE Game Jam 2022</em> - https://itch.io/jam/gdsc-1 over the course of 72 hours.
