The demo includes only the very first mission and does not include any of the advanced automation and transportation features, biomes, the world map etc. which the full game will include. Also, the game is still in early alpha so expect to experience some bugs and inconveniences - it is not representative of the final game.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you like what you see and would like to support the project, please have a look at and back the  Kickstarter campaign! \u263a\r\n<br/>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473925211/648829204?ref=537751&amp;token=f3632216\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTo learn more about the game, follow it on Facebook, YouTube or visit my blog.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Kubifaktorium/ </li><li>Kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473925211/648829204?ref=537751&amp;token=f3632216</li><li>Blog: https://kubifaktorium.com/ </li><li>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/bossconstructor</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>\r\nColony Building and Management<br/></strong>\r\nThe heart of your colony consists of loyal colonists who will mine resources, farm crops and craft tools and weapons. Each colonist has a different set of skills which will change based of the jobs he or she performs. Managing your colonists needs and abilities is vital to ensuring your colony's efficiency. </p>\n<p><strong>\r\nDifferent Biomes\r\n<br/></strong>In the course of the campaign you will explore and colonize multiple islands and encounter different biomes. Each biome features new enemies and challenges but also new resources to discover and process. </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automation</strong><br/>While your colonists are awesome, their work power is limited. Fortunately, your colonists know how to craft advanced machinery like automated farms and smelters, which you can use to automate more and more of your production.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>\r\nLogistics and Transportation</strong><br/>\r\nAs your colony grows and your production hums along, transporting the resources you need becomes a bottleneck. Kubifaktorium features a number of transportation systems like trains, conveyor belts, zeppelins and more. Automated depots and inserters are there to help you store, sort and keep track of all your goods. </p>\n<p><strong>\r\nWeapon Crafting, Enemies and Combat</strong><br/>The new lands are inhabited and guarded by mighty enemies and you will need mighty weaponry to defeat them. The game will feature multiple weapon types and multiple quality tiers of each weapon.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mod Support</strong><br/>The game is designed to be mod friendly and will allow players to create anything from new goods and industries to total conversions with new terrains and scenery. Created mods can be published and managed via the Steam Workshop.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Other Features</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Helpful and lean UI with plenty of tooltips and explanations. </li><li>Integration for Steam Workshop, Steam trading cards and achievements.</li><li>The game is developed for and will be available on Windows, Mac and Linux.</li></ul>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/837831faf838c6258dc6031857a11151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kubifaktorium"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
