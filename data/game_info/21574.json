All you have to do is interview characters, spot their lies and catch them out!<br />\nContradiction is a brand new take on the concept of an interactive movie and brings the genre to a whole new level of playability.  It plays as smoothly as a 3D graphic game. You can wander freely around the game environment, collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events.<br />\nBut the game is all about interviewing the characters you meet, questioning them about all the evidence you\u2019ve collected and things you\u2019ve seen, then spotting contradictions in their answers.  Pair two contradictions together and watch them try to worm out of it!<br />\nWorks best plugged into a TV preferably with a bunch of people to help spot the lies - but can be played alone on your laptop or PC just fine!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T19:55:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98a/98ac17bb47565b06a207151cd6f67a8a.jpg", "website": "http://baggycat.com/epk", "rating": 4.05, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 152, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 18, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Baggy Cat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Baggy Cat"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
