I know I can build something much better, it just takes time (which is a valuable resource) and any donations will further that cause :)</p><p>I hope you get a laugh or too out of how bad some of it is!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77a7726a9afa2d218609afc64ba6c9d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["light"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
