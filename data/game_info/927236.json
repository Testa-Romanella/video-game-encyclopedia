The objective is to reach the end of this dangerous path between dimensions using the weapons that you will have as a reward for defeating your enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The game is casual and easy. You just have to press the enemy to use a random weapon that has 3 power levels (normal, empowered and critical). Then you have 2 seconds to dodge the enemy's action if you think it's the best time by swiping left or right. The attack and defense of the player and the enemy are put face to face to calculate the damage. You can also upgrade your attributes and unlock new amulets for a better chance of finishing your journey by using Dark Matter at the start of each challenge.</p>\n<ul><li>Click the enemy to attack</li><li>Click the dodge button to dodge (Use 1 Dodge Orbe)</li><li>Click an object to see its explanation</li><li>Hold click on the amulets and drag it on a slot to equip them</li><li>Use Dark Matter to\u00a0 improve your stats and buy amulets</li><li>Your game is automatically saved every turn, you can continue your journey whenever you want</li><li>Gray weapon background: Attributes x1</li><li>Yellow weapon background: Attributes x1.5</li><li>Red weapon background: Attributes x2</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Adapt your strategy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Dark Matter Dimensions</strong>\u00a0you have 3 ways to change your strategy:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Amulets give you effects that you can take advantage of when traveling through dimensions\r\n</li><li>Each weapon has a special feature that can be enhanced with equipped stones by varying its attack and defense\r\n</li><li>At the end of each battle, you can heal yourself (Flashback) or you can improve your attributes with an associated punishment (Distortion)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>If you love\u00a0<strong>roguelike / roguelite style games</strong>\u00a0with increasing difficulty and are looking for a fun\u00a0<strong>casual game, Dark Matter Dimensions</strong>\u00a0is a game that fits the bill.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What do we find in Dark Matter Dimensions?</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Graphic style that mixes classic and modern\r\n</li><li>Random-based battle mechanics and understanding of weapons\r\n</li><li>Roguelike / roguelite with random selection of enemies\r\n</li><li>More than 35 weapons with their own characteristics\r\n</li><li>More than 30 amulets to combine in each trip\r\n</li><li>Unlock secrets for the most daring players\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Other games:\u00a0Witch Guild Survivor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T12:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a57e73035adbc02e815aba052acd3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunshine.Inc"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
