You'll fight endless hordes of demons and titans as you power up your army all the way to Mount Olympus where Hades waits for the final showdown.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Karma System allows players to help each other out by sharing loot earned in levels. When you die in a level, your tombstone will appear in someone elses world. If they pray at the location, they'll earn karma for the duration of the level. Any items they earn will be shared with you (the next time you're back at the world map). Increasing your karma will earn you special unlocks - weapons, characters, and other important items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome characters you'll unlock will have the ability to capture the souls of your enemies, which can then be summoned by anyone during battle. Increase your odds by collecting a huge roster of powerful enemies to fight alongside you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSkulls of Olympus features 3 distinct types of levels. A battle has you fighting through ever increasing odds until the boss challenges you. After defeating it, you'll then have to find the exist and escape the level. Survival levels take away your controls and pick all random upgrades. You're just a spectator, BUT you can earn more upgrade cards and weapon gems here than you can through other means. Lastly, defense levels tasks you with defending a city until time runs out. All of the characters you've unlocked will fire arrows off of the city wall to help you complete the level!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-26T07:16:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1d/c1dfe1d8d5e7a6fa868b26a61d09b951.jpg", "website": "http://www.dynamicvoltagegames.online", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dynamic Voltage Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dynamic Voltage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
