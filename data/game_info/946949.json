This game only features the basic fundamentals of a TBS game. In order for this to be considered a strategy game you would be required to implement alternative win conditions, consider FSM states of the AI, and design balanced levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b34cb68652774081c7483df19b9a907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arroslin"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
