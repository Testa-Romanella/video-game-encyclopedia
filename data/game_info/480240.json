Supports local multiplayer and AI opponents. It may lack graphics, but this is compensated with carefully crafter sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>Game is about building ships (or using pre-built ones) and using them to battle against other humans or AI. Physics simulation where everything affects everything should make the gameplay unpredictable and chaotic enough. Ships are built of modules of different types (armors, power sources, cannons, missile launchers etc.). Individual modules are damaged and destroyed during battles, which changes ship balance constantly.<br/></p>\n<p>Game is still in its infancy and developing steadily as I have spare time. Expect severe balancing issues and weaponry ranging from overpowered to useless ones.</p>\n<p>Recommendations: large display, company, controllers.</p>\n<p>What Avaruustaistelupeli has:</p>\n<ul><li>More or less functional game flow with individual battles and tournaments.</li><li>Local multiplayer gaming with keyboard+mouse and xbox/playstation-controllers.</li><li>AI that lacks most of the 'I'-part, but offers a reasonable challenge already.</li><li>Ship-builder.</li><li>Tons of bugs to explore and exploit.</li><li>The Jazz.</li></ul>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>Short term goals (0.5.0, during\u00a02020):</p>\n<ul><li>Better balancing (AI skill levels, energy consumption, \u2026)</li><li>Possibility to use own ships in tournament fleets.</li><li>New module types</li><li>Better controller handling (4 controllers,\u00a0customization etc)</li><li>Graphics\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Long term goals (1.0.0, someday):</p>\n<ul><li>More graphics</li><li>Online multiplayer (implemented in theory but needs polishing, lots of testing\u00a0etc)</li><li>Co-op team game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c37/c3787865abd49abb23cdbe996ed7120e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mobile Last"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
