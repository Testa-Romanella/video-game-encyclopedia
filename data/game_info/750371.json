All old maps are re-polished to make them consistent in look with the newer ones. Maps are &quot;progressively&quot; chained together (so the previous map&#39;s end is more or less linked to the next one&#39;s start). Difficulty is medium, sometimes hard, but not insane. Experienced players can do it in UV without any problem.</p>\n<p>HBFM29.wad: the full version of MAP29. Load this if you think your port/computer can handle the awesomeness (or laggyness) of it. Barely any gameplay difference, though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-06T12:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dcd504ddfee110dd3469fdba8ad1b5f.jpg", "website": "https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/hellbnd", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
