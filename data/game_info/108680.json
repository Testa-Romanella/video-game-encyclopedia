Player press 'return' to commit to a hiding or seeking position. When both players have committed the positions of the hiding and seeking player are shown, as well as an accuracy score between 0 and 100%.</p><p>The game runs best on Linux in a \"real\" terminal. That is, in text mode. </p><p>The source code for the game can be found here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a260780a0b2c6a47223ec22185b56005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["wilbefast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
