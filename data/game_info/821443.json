It is my first game jam, so the game is pretty simple and not that good. There isn't much dice theming either.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to shoot enemies that spawn on the left side of the screen, and stop them from hitting you. After you kill all the enemies, you get an upgrade. When you pick an upgrade, the next time enemies spawn you will get 1 extra die of enemies spawning depending on the upgrade you chose. For example: If you choose to upgrade fire rate, you will go against 1d8 extra basic enemies in the next wave, and every wave after that. If you die or press escape, the game closes.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>90% of coding done by me. Music by\u00a0https://toastercommission.carrd.co/.
