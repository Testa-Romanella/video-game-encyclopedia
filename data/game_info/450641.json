We play bingo almost every Saturday on stream!\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Press R to reshuffle the board.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Click and drag the Xs to move them onto squares.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Try and get BINGO!\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CHARITY STREAM BINGO. SATURDAY, 6 JUNE, 2020, 3-6PM AMERICAN EASTERN TIME.</strong></p>\n<p>This weekend, I will be streaming for charity! This coming Saturday (the 6th of June), I will be playing bingo on my Breath of the Wild stream, as I usually do. But now people can finally play along if they want as well!\u00a0<br/>How it will work:\u00a0<br/>I will be donating to Campaign Zero, an organisation dedicated to ending police violence in the United States.\u00a0<br/>I will start by donating $40 as a baseline. For every bingo that I get, I will donate an additional $10.\u00a0<br/><strong>For people playing bingo, I will donate $10 in your (user)name and you will get onto a special list of people who get bingo on my bio page! Send a screenshot via Discord (most preferable) in #bingo, the comments section on the bingo page on Itch, Twitter (@penguincucco) or Instagram (@penguincoco#9653).\u00a0<br/>I will be donating $200 total. At the end of the stream, if there is any remaining money (money that is not donated in the name of someone who gets bingo or my master bingo board on the stream), I will be donating the remainder with love from the entire WADDLE SQUAD :Lumi:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I will be donating for all of us, but throughout the stream I will be encouraging people to donate along the way. Every bit helps, even just $5! If you do donate, please let me know either via (again), Discord, Twitter or Instagram! Throughout the stream I will also be projecting the total amount donated, the username of the latest donor and the username of the latest bingo winner!\u00a0<br/>Again, I will be donating $200 regardless of if people play bingo or not, but I hope we can all still have a little fun despite these difficult times and support a good cause!</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you all for playing!\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:49:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b343a00a26fb3a3c17516fcb4c1fe9fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sammy Chuang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
