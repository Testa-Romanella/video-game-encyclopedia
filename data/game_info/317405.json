It is a 2d platformer with some puzzle elements included. The story is about an oni who is trying to find his way back to the japanese underworld. The player must reach the in the level by jumping and moving certain objects. I created all of the levels from a pre made kit in my class and the art assets for the character, background, and some objects are not my own. They belong to and came from Pinterest, steam.community, TdeLeeuw, Pukahuna, and animekida.com according to where I found them on google.
