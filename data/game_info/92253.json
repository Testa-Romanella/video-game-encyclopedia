But this laboratory proves to be a maze, with strange doors scattered about. The key to opening them: emotions.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game stands out for a unique gameplay inspired by the range of emotions by the American psychologist Robert Plutchik. Eight basic emotions (fear, anger, joy, sadness, boredom, disgust, envy and surprise) that react to the stimuli offered by the world and open up new possibilities.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a prototype.
