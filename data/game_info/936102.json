But you don\u2019t have to face this alone. Brave the mazes and challenges, solve the puzzles and conundrums, light a fire, and find your fellow wanderers to escape from the depths.\r\n<p><em>i was alone, so i set a fire </em>is a 2-4 player, collaborative, prompt-based dungeon crawler where players find themselves lost in an ever-shifting shifting labyrinth filled with danger and mystery. Players draw from a standard deck of playing cards to reveal rooms in the labyrinth, face challenges, find one another, and hopefully escape.</p>\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n<ul><li><strong>Designer:\u00a0</strong>Brandon George</li><li><strong>Editors:\u00a0</strong>Jon Boyle &amp;\u00a0Reilly Qyote</li><li><strong>Illustration:\u00a0</strong>dan qui dam</li><li><strong>Layout:\u00a0</strong>Sam Zimmerman</li></ul>\n<p>This zine was created and published by the Far Horizons CoOp as part of the\u00a0<em>A Thousand Burning Stars</em> series of small games.
