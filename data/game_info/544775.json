The twist is that the Earth is currently overrun with rogue AI that was made to fix the damage done to Earth during WWIII. What is left of humanity had to escape into space to survive and began the process of making a giant space station out near the largest of Saturn\u2019s moons, Titan.</p>\n<p>After many years of building and experimenting scientists were finally able to create a spacecraft able to visit other systems within the Milky Way. This adventure is done in the hope that humanity will be able to find a permanent residence or find a way to take back the Earth.</p>\n<p>There is a health system in place that will allow you to crash into something 10 times before it kicks you back to the first level. This health is reset at each level so on every level you will start with full health. There are currently 7 levels in this build that start simple and get more complex. The first 4 have a still camera, while the last 3 have a camera that does a loose follow of the player (I will tighten this up in the future).</p>\n<p>My first time making a 3D game with some added features. I\u00a0will be back to further improve this game when\u00a0I gain some more knowledge on the upgrades on want to do such as adding enemies, UI, music sound effect volume control,\u00a0\u00a0and instructions in the game. I also think I will add a further storyline to this game in the future.</p>\n<p>To close the game just close the browser window.</p>\n<p>For now, the controls are</p>\n<p>Space to boost up</p>\n<p>Left Shift to boost down (mainly used if you get stuck upside down)</p>\n<p>A to tilt left</p>\n<p>D to tilt Right</p>\n<p>F to rotate the ship 180 degrees so that it faces the exact opposite way</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T05:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/499646d3109ee29f2ca1b9f31885d211.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chad_Bowman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
