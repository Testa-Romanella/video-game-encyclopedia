Staying alive for as long as you can.</p>\n<p>\r\n    Development Discord: https://discord.gg/H5bDvtyDkU<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Q: Why is there only 1 story</p>\n<p>A: They take long to write<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Q: How complete is the game?<br/></p>\n<p>A: The games main features (story parser, combat system, save system ,etc) are complete however there are still some bugs and features that I want to add. Also I kinda have to make the stories for the game too and those take a while.</p>\n\n<p>Q: What do you plan on adding?</p>\n<p>A: Mostly modding support and a very robust story parsing system. Since the whole game is basically text based its a good idea to get a very robust system in place. Other \"features\" i would probably add are just UI tweaks/fixes unless someone comes up with a good idea.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f722e62e8c5d9899eff75ea0c0e1ef2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["The_Glit_ch"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
