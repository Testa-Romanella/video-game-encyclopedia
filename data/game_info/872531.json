But just how far away is it? And how many times will you die before you get there?<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>MOBILE CONTROLS</strong>: your screen is the control button. Swipe and hold \u2013 anywhere on screen \u2013 to apply thrust in that direction. Release touch to cut thrusters, and drift...</p>\n<p><strong>KEYBOARD CONTROLS</strong>: if playing on desktop you can control the SpaceLander's directional thrusters using the arrow keys (\u2b06\ufe0f, \u2b07\ufe0f, \u2b05\ufe0f, \u27a1\ufe0f) or Vim keys (H, J, K, L).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FUEL CONSUMPTION:</strong> you will burn the most fuel when braking and accelerating, so plan ahead and use your fuel wisely.</p>\n<p>_____________________________________________</p>\n<p>An iOS and Android mobile version of the game is in development. The web version will remain playable and free permanently.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T14:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0a/c0a55a3f98226e14b05424fe6e4e8cef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Makktu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
