The first time you impress an NPC with flowers, they become a new\u00a0<strong>Love Interest</strong>, and award you 100 points. As a\u00a0Love Interest, this NPC will continue generating points \u2014 so long as you maintain the relationship. In fact, the longer you maintain a relationship, the faster it generates points!</p>\n<p>Though happy at first, eventually Love\u00a0Interests will feel neglected and\u00a0demand another gift of flowers.\u00a0When this happens, be sure to get there with a new gift before time runs out \u2014 wait too long, and your former Love Interest will become\u00a0<em>very</em> unhappy. Like\u00a0<em>ragingly</em>, <em>murderously</em> unhappy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Likewise, be careful of who's around you when you give out flowers. If a Love Interest witnesses you giving flowers to someone else, they will immediately transform into a RAGING MURDEROUS EX.</p>\n<p>Raging\u00a0Murderous Exes will try to kill you with guns. If that's not annoying enough, they also run around and open their blabby\u00a0mouths about your polyamory, causing your otherwise-happy Love Interests to also freak out and become Raging Murderous Exes themselves. This gossiping can spread like wildfire, and if things get too far out of hand, you might find yourself completely surrounded by your Raging Exes, all armed with guns.</p>\n<p>In summary, try to maintain as many happy Love Interest relationships as you can, but don't get caught cheating, and try not to get shot too many times.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30e/30e6966bdfa50f20db2dcea4d18e67de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["savvyindoorsman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
