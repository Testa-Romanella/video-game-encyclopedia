If I dial the correct number, then I will be able to move ... somewhere else. But what are these numbers? Where to get them? And why is it needed? Doesn't matter. I must go ahead. The main thing is not to be afraid of anything. After all, if I die, I'll come back here.<br/>Welcome to a weird, surreal dream world where our hero must solve puzzles to move on.
