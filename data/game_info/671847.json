He quickly grabs the shrinkable\u00a0rocket ship he has in his pocket and ascends into the sky to save the world!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>What if CAVE or Toaplan made a bullet-hell for the original Game Boy back in the 90s?\u00a0With a resolution of 160x144, 4 colours and the spirit of my youth playing the portable brick, here's a short 1-level shoot-em-up I developed\u00a0for GBJAM 9.</p>\n\r\n\r\nTips and Tricks\r\n<ul><li>The hitbox of the pocketship is smaller than its sprite. Take some time to get used to it!</li><li>The laser is more powerful but it's overheating quickly if you use it too much. Pay attention to the bottom right corner for the overheating meter.</li><li>While using the laser, you move slower. It can be useful when you're surrounded with bullets and you need to move more precisely.</li><li>When you beat the game, it unlocks a more challenging mode. Select it on the title screen!</li></ul>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Level music by Nourished by Music</li><li>Ending music by Shane Ivers</li><li>Early Game Boy font by Jimmy Campbell</li><li>Pixelated font by Skylar Park</li><li>Mobile controls UI by Potomax</li><li>Godot logo by Herrwoland</li></ul>\r\n\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<p>All of this will be fixed when the jam is over!</p>\n<ul><li>The music only plays on the left side. Sorry for the issue if you play with headphones.</li>\n<li>Settings menu kicks you out right when you entered. It's just showing the controlc, so check out the page description instead.</li><li>If pausing when you're game over, the pause effect will carry to the title screen. Unfortunately, there's no way to unpause from there.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSocials\r\n<p>You can follow me on Twitter<br/>I also speedrun retro games\u00a0on Twitch<br/>I have a community Discord\u00a0for my speedruns and game dev endeavours<br/><br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T07:21:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc2286d96e4fabf8c56e020ba4a8867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["SuperMegaDav"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
