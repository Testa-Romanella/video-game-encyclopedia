Lots of bugs, lots of problems, but I thought it'd be cool to throw a quick tutorial level from some older assets\u00a0that\u00a0people could coherently play. A lot of things are still up in the air design wise, so if you're actually reading this, feel free to throw some suggestions at me on discord.<br/>Non-comprehensive list of known bugs/issues that are tied to the PlayTest:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Can clip into colliders at random if brushing against them the wrong way, causing a hard lock (this is hella annoying, but it's since been resolved).</li><li>Various clipping textures (has been resolved with later versions)</li><li>Ultimate status is stuck if ultimate is switched in ability menu mid-cast.\r\n</li><li>Most bot missile launch warmup timer causes missiles to get stuck to Filian if they are too close initially\r\n</li><li>Laser sprite sometimes maps incorrectly\r\n</li><li>Ability availability color only updates when it is active ability\r\n</li><li>Sprite flip animation freezes under grounded collision (merely a graphical glitch. does not impact functionality)\r\n</li><li>The laser is extremely loud on occasion. Abnormally loud.\r\n</li><li>More things that I am certainly forgetting.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>This is build 0.0.6 because there were 5 builds more scuffed than this that came before. The actual current\u00a0game version is quite a way ahead of this however (I moved the actual updates to a private repo) and is far less scuffed I assure you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fd7dfd0040330c7e956779f169e22e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RasterizedCup"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
