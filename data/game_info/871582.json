I will be providing bug-fixes for the duration of the jam's voting period, and leaving the original version (1.0.0) up for transparency's sake. If you're not rating this game in cosmic horrors jam, I would encourage you to <strong>download the most recent build</strong><strong> available</strong>.</p>\n<p>Content updates may come in the future, as there was much I wanted to do with this game that I didn't have time for, as well as generally filling out the sound effects and visual effects to make the game more immersive.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking a look at my game, I really appreciate it. I hope you have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T07:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/386/386da47f80d26fa5258bd3a4ba239aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shrine Dynamics"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
