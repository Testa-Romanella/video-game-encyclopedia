It was created by Broccoli in July 2000, when it launched a multi-platformed project called Project G.A. The anime and Galaxy Angel Party manga comprise a comedy story in an alternate universe, while the games and the regular manga have a serious romance and action plot.<br />\nA sequel to the game trilogy was released in June 2006, entitled Galaxy Angel II: Zettai Ry\u014diki no Tobira, and stars an entirely new cast, the &quot;Rune Angel Troupe&quot;, and a new feature that combines the new Brave Heart frame with any of the Angels. Each of the Rune Angels has a connection to one of the Galaxy Angels, such as Apricot Sakuraba, the younger sister of Milfeulle Sakuraba. Just like the original Galaxy Angel, the Galaxy Angel II series is a trilogy of games and has a manga adaptation and comedic anime spinoff. The second Galaxy Angel II game was released in October 2007 entitled Galaxy Angel II: Mugen Kair\u014d no Kagi.<br />\nThe success of the video game and anime series influenced the creation of a manga series based on the video game universe. In Japan, the series became so popular that a musical based on the series was made. Entitled &quot;GALAXY ANGEL ~The Musical~&quot;, it debuted in March and December 2005, and featured cast members who also worked on Galaxy Angel II.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb318ce7a6c7a6faf0a26e66f3cb5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "PC", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Broccoli"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
