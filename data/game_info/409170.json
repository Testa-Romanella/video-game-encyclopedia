I only made the first two worlds of the game, but\u00a0I ended up having a lot of fun making this silly game, and decided I wanted to finish it. This January, I finally found a good opportunity to thanks to the 2020 Finally Finish Something Jam hosted by Second Dimension Games.</p>\n<p><em>Super Robert</em> is, strangely, a memoir (with various names, places, and details changed, of course,)\u00a0following my life after moving from Illinois and New York. You play as me and dodge pigeons, cars, and giant pianos, while collecting headphones,\u00a0music notes, and brownies. It's not just platforming, though, because there are also mini-games and boss fights that break up the side-scrolling. If you play well enough, you can even take a vacation to Maine to earn\u00a0extra points and lives!</p>\n<p>This game is done in the style of a Nintendo Entertainment System game, attempting to utilize\u00a0the same palette, sprite limitations, and audio track limitations. Like many NES platformers, the game has eight worlds, and each world has four levels each, plus a mini-game and a boss battle.</p>\n\n<p>The main game follows the format of\u00a0a traditional side-scroller: move to left\u00a0and jump over enemies\u00a0and obstacles, collecting power-ups, and reading dialogue from various characters\u00a0along the way. Between levels, though, you'll get to see a map of\u00a0all the levels in the current world. Simply move Super Robert between these with the\u00a0arrow keys,\u00a0and press start to begin. The bright pink bonus levels work the same way,\u00a0and can only be completed once per world.</p>\n<p>If at\u00a0any point, you're ready to take\u00a0a break, pressing the space bar on the world map will let you see\u00a0a postcard from Super Robert, complete with\u00a0a secret password on the right. Take note of this password, since you'll be\u00a0able to use it next time you boot up the game by pressing the space bar on the title screen.</p>\n<p>Even though this game is odd\u00a0and not very innovative, I hope you enjoy playing it!</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Enter - Start/Pause/Begin Level</p>\n<p>Space - Jump/Continue/View Password/Select</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>Z - Shoot a CD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T05:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c75f71fb3f1adc8612d4cf416fb62bbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["robert0504"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
