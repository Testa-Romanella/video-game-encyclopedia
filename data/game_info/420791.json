Is to do this~</p>\n<p>Every time you go to the GAME-OVER screen, and return to the level you were last at. You are Granted a +1 Lucky Kitty Life Booster. So for example you start out with 3 and you lose for the very first time, when you return you will start out with 4, and it keeps stacking... 5,6,7+ SOOOOOO basically It rewards you whenever you lose the game. This is to ensure that the player Will get to the End of the Game. I know I made it kinda Difficult on some parts. loool Believe me *yelps I even have trouble and I am the Creator! *swts. But I added that so Hopefully the Player won't get too discouraged... Also Note on the Game Over Screen there is a Random Lucky Uplifting Quote to keep You Motivated! All of those are Real Quotes by Famous People and there are 23 of them in Total. Very good Stuff I must say myself! But ya. Just Lose the game 4-5 times, to give you a 7-8 Life Buffer. That should set you up for the Rest of the Game! But Also Note, You won't get the Alternate Boss Battle if you lose once. That's for Expert Gamers Only! lool ~~~\"thinks to himself~you've never once done that yourself you goober~\" *swts more lool</p>\n<p>~ Just J.A.B IT ~}~_6}_/c]]]] \u00a0 &lt; Fist BUMP Yo! )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b3f53559c6a573eed843b0b749036a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Andrew Buividas"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
