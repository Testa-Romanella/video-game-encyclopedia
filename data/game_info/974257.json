{"id": 974257, "slug": "epic-eon", "name": "Epic Eon", "name_original": "Epic Eon", "description": "Epic Eon is a single-player real-time strategy game set in a fantasy world that is a bit different from other RTS genre games. It does not feature any workers, buildings, or resource gathering. Instead, players control a single monarch leading a faction, enabling the creation of units, capturing runes for resources, and engaging in combat to conquer all other factions and their monarchs.<br/><br/>In this world, diverse factions coexist: orcs, humans, dwarfs, elves, undead, barbarians, animals, and many more. Each faction has its own history, traditions, unique units, and monarchs.<h3>CAMPAIGNS</h3><br/>Dive into diverse campaigns tailored for each race. Defend against ambushes, assist the greedy dwarfs, or unleash your inner unstoppable Orc warrior, and much, much more.<br/><br/>Each mission boasts a unique atmosphere, ambiance, and distinct goals. Some missions completely alter perspective by seamlessly merging RTS and RPG hybrid elements.<br/><br/>In the Epic Eon global campaigns, you might find yourself playing as one faction, attacking in one timeline, and later defending against that same faction in another timeline on identical maps, each with its unique goals and objectives.<br/><br/><br/><h3>SKIRMISH</h3> <br/>When you're in the mood for a different kind of challenge, there's a skirmish mode. Here, you can test your strategies against the AI and measure the strength of your tactics.<br/><br/>Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some factions are stronger than others, but even a weaker faction can win against a stronger one if its unit collection is far superior!<br/><br/>Players should learn about each faction's units and their types to understand how to counter them on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The Artificial Intelligence employs simple yet strong logic sets that can occasionally learn from previous mistakes, making it progressively better. It also adapts by changing its faction monarchs and unit collections.<br/><br/>For now, Skirmish mode is specifically designed for single-player gameplay.<br/><br/><br/><h3>MODES</h3><br/>Getting kinda bored with the current skirmishes? Feel like they're a bit too easy? Well, enable some extra settings to make things more interesting and, for some real thrill, enable the Enigma option. Get ready for some wild and random events that'll totally spice up the gameplay!<br/><br/><br/><h3>COLLECTIONS</h3><br/>If you're getting a bit tired of the same old regular units, no worries, we got you covered. Check out the Collection feature where you can handpick the units you want for your favorite faction. It's like a customized army for your gaming pleasure. Plus, you can read up on each unit and find out their roles in the game's lore.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T05:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/1799f68027301b697863575b3eb91cdc.jpg", "website": "https://histriagames.com/title/epic-eon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Histria Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Histria Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
