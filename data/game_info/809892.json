The name is not finalized, but the game is a physics + momentum-based platformer meant for speedrunning. A timer will be added, and Level 3 will be changed. The speed and jump also need to be adjusted as Level 6 is now impossible.</p>\n<p>This game will be updated in the future to include more levels, a storyline, an energy laser,\u00a0better coins (2 per level, which each unlock new levels), and, of course, bug fixes. Lots and lots of bug fixes. Oh yes, and details to the levels that already exist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffa852a652c5888391ab2c0bfd6e2066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Khord"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
