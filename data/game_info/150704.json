Corpses block bullets so you will need to upgrade your weapons and manage your surroundings to get a high score!</p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0<br/>Use [W],[A],[S],[D] to move your character around the battlefield, shooting zombies toward your cursor with [Left Click].\u00a0</p>\n<p>Guns:<br/>There are three available guns: pistol, rifle, and submachinegun. Each has their own unique damage, reload speed, clip size, and penetration (how many zombies 1 bullet can go through). Toggle between these guns with [Q] and [E].</p>\n<p>Items:<br/>There are three available items: bomb, decoy, and shield. Each has their own unique cooldown and behavior.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Bomb: Use the bomb [1] to deal massive damage to all zombies within the blast zone. The bomb will destroy corpses!(Known bug, only works once)</p>\n<p>-Shield: Use the shield [2] to block all zombie damage for a set amount of time.</p>\n<p>-Decoy: Use the decoy [3] to distract the zombies and get them off you.
