But the entrance closes behind him and locks him in!</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>W - Jump</li><li>E - Hang from wall</li><li>S - Drop from Hanging</li><li>F - Enter</li><li>Space - Dash (Gained\u00a0Ability)</li><li>Escape - Pause</li></ul>\n<p>I composed the main music of the game using Beepbox.co. There's an alternate theme that goes unused as of right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Status:</strong> There are a few things in this build that I noticed that bother me a little bit, so I may fix those and reupload. Other than that, I'm not sure how much more I'll work on this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:\u00a0</strong>There is\u00a0<strong>no saving\u00a0</strong>coded into the game yet (this is a feature I would like to add). However there is something at the end that you can use anywhere in the game.\u00a0Get there to find out what.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T13:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4d07e13d2a77eb5f399f234dbc566e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam Larson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
