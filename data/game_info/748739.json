If you could join a radio drama already in progress, talk to the characters and interact with the environments the story painted in your mind, you might find yourself in the world of the area man. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA quirky radio drama unfolds around you in VR while you do your best to keep the radio station humming along as its new DJ.
