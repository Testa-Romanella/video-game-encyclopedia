Play as Ash the Ember Knight, cannon-wielding specialist Dead Eye the Tainted or crafty hero explosives specialist Samson III in teams of four to scout for power-ups and create an effective (and deadly) defensive perimeter. Fight alone or alongside soldiers with distinct abilities to withstand the might of the demon horde across a number of thematic maps \u2013 each with its unique environmental twist. Set up archers, catapults, and mages \u2013 and carefully choose where to place them for maximum defensive cover.

Entire kingdoms crumbled before the sun rose again to reveal an endless army reaching the horizons. Only a handful of humans stood in front of them.<br />\nThrough great sacrifice, these Hell Warders crafted the first of the Nexuses to hold back the worst of hell.
