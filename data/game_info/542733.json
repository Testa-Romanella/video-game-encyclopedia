Welcome to LAYERS !</p>\n<p>And you might be wondering. \"who are you?\" \"what is LAYERS?\" \"what is LAYERS about?\" \"how can I get this \"LAYERS?\"\"\u00a0\"who is that on my front lawn?\" and \"why does he have a knife?\" All of these questions and (not) more will be answered!</p>\n<p>\"Who are you?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well I guess I should introduce myself. Hi I'm the program! I'm not only the area in which the entirety of LAYERS takes place NOR am I only the funny and witty commentary\u00a0in LAYERS but I'll also serve as your guide to the game!</p>\n<p>\"What is LAYERS?\"</p>\n<p>LAYERS is a (mostly) platformer made by \"Eggs1232\" (if that even is his real name) Eggs is also the leader and founder of Pen Studios! LAYERS is in very early development so show your love and support by telling us how to do better! Even though with LAYERS being his first game it is probably going to take about... (calculates number) !@#$% years to complete!</p>\n<p>\"What Is LAYERS about?\"</p>\n<p>Layers is a platformer about a stranger who gets kidnaped and stuffed into a (very handsome and funny) program Lucky him! When the full game comes out it will have a multitude of endings so try to find them all!</p>\n<p>\"How do I get LAYERS?\"</p>\n<p>Even though you cant get the full game just yet because it is far from finished you can still get the games demo right here on this website!</p>\n<p>\"Whos that on my front lawn?\" and \"Why does he have a knife?\"</p>\n<p>Wait... WHAT!</p>\n\n<p>Well I hope that that clears up all of your questions about LAYERS! Have fun and try out the demo!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>YOU NEED TO GET US OUT OF HERE.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac9eb1c595f1bc14a0bf56ba7dcf004.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PenStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
