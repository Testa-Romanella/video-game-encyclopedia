On windows, copies of all the photographs you take will be stored in your \"Pictures\\VoidIdyllic\" folder. If you are using the Itch app's sandboxing feature, they will be stored in the itch-player user's Pictures folder instead.</li><li><strong>Q</strong>: My computer doesn't meet the recommended requirements; can I still run the game?</li><li><strong>A</strong>: Probably. On less powerful systems you may be able to improve performance by reducing the Particle Density option in the game settings, as those are the game's most demanding feature.</li><li><strong>Q</strong>: Will the game be available for other platforms, or as a web build?</li><li><strong>A</strong>: A web build is unlikely because of the game's size, but OSX and Linux builds may be available in the future.</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Design, Art and Code:\u00a0Thomas Morley</li><li>Music and Sound Design:\u00a0James Evans (jamesmusic.co.uk)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T02:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78dbfeaa49d909fb4f9cbc5b322ce2f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tjm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
