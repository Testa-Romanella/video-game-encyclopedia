You play as a freedom-loving chicken seeking life, liberty, and the opportunity not to be turned into a four-piece combo. However, ruthless farmers aim to hunt you down and sell your delicious carcass to Big Chicken. To escape, you must ransack human settlements on six playable levels, ranging from large-scale, commercial farms to the bustling, industrial suburbs of the chicken-eaters, to collect your keys to freedom. Avoid farmers and their well-placed traps; otherwise, you\u2019ll be seeing the inside of a fryer tonight.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Six detailed themed playable levels</li><li>Randomly appearing free range eggs that can be collected for points or health</li><li>Above average IQ farmers using A* search</li><li>Replay to\u00a0get new high scores</li><li>Window/Fullscreen mode support</li><li>Buk-buk-ba-gak!</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys -\u00a0 movement</li><li>H - use cluck ability to knock farmers down</li><li>Esc - pause game</li></ul>\r\nAuthors\r\n<ul><li>Andrew Hein</li><li>Jeffrey Jin</li><li>Long Nguyen</li><li>Hwan Kim</li></ul>\n<p>Developed for CMPT 276 Fall 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T05:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c075f0fdf4d48e0bf2a14f90a61818.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jeffrey Jin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
