This time Osiris will show the world of humans what he&#39;s made of. But the ankh alone is not enough - not as long as he hasn&#39;t found the most important part of his body: his heart.<br />\nLife has not been kind to Assil. Only three weeks ago he managed to ward off his death curse. Since then a relationship (with Thara) has hit the rocks and the Ankh was stolen from him (by sinister assassins). Assil sets out to get it all back.<br />\nHe is not the only victim, however - there is another: the pharaoh! One moment he sits on his throne, lazy, sluggish and with a heck of a hangover, the next he is a slave in his own quarry - how could this have happened? And more importantly: how is he going to get out of this without getting killed?<br />\nAnkh: Heart Of Osiris is even more intense and more bizarre as it takes the player even deeper into the lazy world of old Cairo. You&#39;ll meet a lot of familiar faces, but there are plenty of new surprises and the same black humor found in the first Ankh.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T14:02:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/557/557303d2e44105033f15011fd26ad4fd.jpg", "website": "http://www.ankh-game.com/", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 124, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 1068, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Classic Macintosh"], "developers": ["Deck 13", "Deck13", "Runesoft", "Deck13 Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Strategy First", "Runesoft", "Deck13 Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
