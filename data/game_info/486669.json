{"id": 486669, "slug": "uwaa", "name": "Uwaa", "name_original": "Uwaa", "description": "<p><strong>Uwaa</strong> is a game about instructions and robots; make instructions for a small robot to complete a level you don't have access to, by using magical instruction-blocks! Uwwa is a puzzle game; but, if you put enough thought into it, you can solve any level, even if you are not good at puzzles!</p>\n<p>You can think of making instructions for the robot as making GPS instructions. You tell the robot to go left, right, up, use the thing right next it, or wait a turn!</p>\n<p>Additionally, Uwwa teaches you the very basics of programming. Don't expect anything slightly more complicated than \"move right\", though.</p>\n<p><strong>~~ HOW TO PLAY ~~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your objective is to build proper instructions for the robot, so that they will use the blue lever (that is present in every level). Use P to see what obstacles the robot should pass. Put the blocks, in order, on the sequencer (the vertical line), to make the robot follow them.</p>\n<p><strong>You are 100% allowed to share your level-code with others in the comment section!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>~~ Features: ~~</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Engaging robot-puzzle-action!</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>level editor/loader!</strong></li><li>A retro pixel-art artstyle!</li><li>You can operate a robot to do work for you!</li><li>Full, original (and calming) soundtrack!</li><li>Did I mention that you can operate a robot?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>~~ Controls: ~~</strong></p>\n<p>WSAD or arrow keys: Move</p>\n<p>R: Restart current level</p>\n<p>Q or P: Preview robot area (toggleable)</p>\n<p>Z or [ENTER]: Execute instruction sequence (go to execute-mode)</p>\n<p>X: Exit instruction sequence (go back to build-mode)</p>\n<p>[ESC] (Escape): Exit to main-menu</p>\n<p><strong>..:: The best level-codes will be featured here! ::..</strong></p>\n<p><strong>~~ Credits: ~~</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, music, general sound/level/game design: ascpixel<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to my friend <strong>CraftDasheq</strong>, who helped me with making some levels!\u00a0&lt;3</p>\n<p>Kenney for the art-kit @ https://kenney.nl/<br/>\"UI, Mechanical, Notification, 01, FX.wav\" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org<br/>Demigiant for the DOTween library<br/>You, for checking out this game &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>This game was made for the Miz\u00a0Jam 1.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T08:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d574ad7df78a5d18286b69e0eebc01c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ascpixel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
