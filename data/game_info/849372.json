Each character has unique traits eg. Double Jump or Wall Stick, be careful how you complete the levels as each character has to complete the level for it to be useable in the next one.\u00a0Your goal is to reach the end of the game and bring light to this dull land.</p>\n<p>Walkthroughs<br/></p>\n<p>I am always looking to improve so I please request that you write a comment on this page with constructive criticism that I can take into hand for future projects and jams. Also note that I have prioritised school derived grade exams over this project and it may not be up to my normal stand / less polished.<br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in the development process of the game then I recommend you read the dev logs. I tried to keep these as detailed as possible but they were not my priority, I mainly wrote into them whilst Unity felt like taking forever to import assets.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<strong>KEY</strong><strong>EVENT</strong>W,A,S,DMovementArrow Keys\u00a0MovementTAB\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Switch CubesR\u00a0RespawnCTRL + RReset LevelT (first)Enable Teleport ModeT (second)Teleport Selected CubeESCReturn to menu\r\n<p>Note: I added my own twist to the game jam and tried to make the code run from as less scripts as possible as usually I have a load of scripts in my main projects and wanted to break way from that behaviour.</p>\n<p>Time metrics for  this project<br/></p>\n\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<ol><li>Cubes Glitch together when level loads (5 onwards). <strong>Fix</strong>: Press R to respawn cubes</li></ol>\n<p>The game name Cubemunity comes from the combination of cube and community.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T04:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/605/605da581f5e7ee05198b29b1975540d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Max-Inc"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
