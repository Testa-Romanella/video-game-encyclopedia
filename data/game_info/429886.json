I specifically wanted to learn how to implement the\u00a0accelerometer and make something move while you tilt your device. Simply tilt your device to avoid the tumbleweeds (spheres as placeholder) as long as you can!\u00a0This game plays and feels almost like a toy which I thought was a pretty interesting feedback from playtests. I plan on making this a polished game with a casual vibe. The 3D models will also be reworked along with the gameplay and gravity of he skull. Stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6adc0d7c60e91e2b4c22c0a2418daa28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Katherine Rosell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
