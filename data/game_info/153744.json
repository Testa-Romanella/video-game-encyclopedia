So, our team decided to make a game that was sort of like a personality test. We'd throw the player into a randomly generated world, and keep track of what they did. Then, we'd try to figure out what they preferred to do in the game. Once we had that figured out, we'd change the experience to suit their desires. We had four traits over two axes. The Aggressiveness-Amicability axis would determine whether the player wanted to interact with the characters in the game, or just kill them. The Anal Retentive-Antsy axis was based on whether the player preferred to spend time in the rooms investigating its contents, or if they just wanted to run as fast as they could from room to room. </p><p>I actually wrote an article on Gamasutra about the procedural generation in ARE, and you can read it here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/17642298b160b088e34a1dd67496dd69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Aaron Chapin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
