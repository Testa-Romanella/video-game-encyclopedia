But do you want to?</em></p>\n<p><em>What if you can befriend them instead?</em></p>\n<p><em>And what about the Wizard with some abandonment issues who is so easy to fluster, will you accept his offer?</em></p>\n<p><em>And, most importantly... why are fairies telling you about the latest anime hit?!</em></p>\n\n<p>Hello, thank you for playing my first serious twine game!</p>\n<p>A basic run is around 10 minutes long, but to uncover all the possible endings you'll have to play for around fourty minutes. <br/></p>\n<p>Don't get discouraged if you die! It's all part of the game, and it will only enhance your experience.
