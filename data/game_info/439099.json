{"id": 439099, "slug": "close-call-racing", "name": "Close Call Racing", "name_original": "Close Call Racing", "description": "<p>A 3D arcade racer in the veins of Split Second: Velocity. It's just not a race against opponents, but against the track aswell. The environment can aid or hinder you in your progress to pole position.<br/>At the moment, the environmental hazard is randomly triggered. Reload the game (backspace) if you want to reset them.<br/><br/>This is an early WIP. So just a small section to test things out. This is my first game-development project and am just a single person, so I'm starting out slow.<br/>My first goal is to have 1 complete track and maybe 2 or 3 different cars. The track will have a coastal theme and trying to go for a modern '80s vibe.<br/>For VR enthousiasts like myself, you'll be glad to hear I'm creating this with VR in mind (hence why the \"mid-poly\"-look). So my current next step will be modeling the inside of the car and implementing VR.<br/>PS: I only own a PSVR-headset and haven't yet been able to get the Kinect\u00a0 track my head without stuttering, so I'm only able to test the VR-functionality without 6DOF-tracking.<br/><br/>This game is made with Blender 2.8x and Godot 3.2. I have no previous experience in game-development, so please take this in consideration. I recently had to start in self-employment and this is a project I'm working on if I don't get any paid assignments. Since I just started, this is also a way for me to get my name as a designer out there, since in my country, there isn't a big market for game-creation or just designing that goes beyond minimalistic in general.<br/>But don't worry, creating a game has been a childhood dream of mine and was the main reason for me to get a bachelor in IT. So this is a project i want to see through. I just want to paint a realistic picture of the progress you are going to see.<br/><br/>Since this is a tech-demo, this is up for grabs, so you can get a feel of the game and controls. Although donations are appreciated.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>- Esc: exit game<br/>- Backspace: reload game (in case you get stuck or you want to reset the hazard-trigger)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Controller:<ul><li>R2/RT : throttle</li><li>L2/LT : brake/reverse (once to full stop, release brake, the press again to go in reverse)</li><li>Triangle / Y : boost</li><li>Circle / B : handbrake</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Keyboard:<ul><li>up-arrow / E : throttle</li><li>down-arrow / numpad . \u00a0/ D / J : brake/reverse</li><li>left-arrow / S : steer left</li><li>right-arrow / F : steer right</li><li>numpad-Enter / K : boost</li><li>numpad-0 / H : handbrake</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Because of QWERTY and AZERTY-keyboard differences not yet implemented, I have chosen to not go for the typical WASD for now.<br/>Also, only if you play with a controller, you'll get the camera effect where the camera looks in the direction you steer. This effect wil only be executed if the joystick is pressed to the extreme left or right and is held more than a second.<br/><br/><em>PS: exporting the Windows executable isn't without its problems at the moment. Executing my code is a hit or miss, resulting in some camera-problems when using the keyboard. So it's advised to play with a controller.</em><br/><br/>Hope you enjoy this \"taste of things to come\".<br/>Cheers.<br/>http://www.eyeEmotion.be<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd0047e5d23dcbe0fdbad1e24e5ae08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eyeEmotion"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
