Innovations abound, from the fun and logical educational puzzles based on actual historical facts, to &quot;question mark&quot; icon that help you discover asynchronous elements caused by Dr. Fred, and the ability to play as Pepper&#39;s dog Lockjaw during some episodes (with appropriate action icons). It&#39;s also difficult enough for adult gamers to enjoy. Highly recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c4dc29648772a6ab186c831580272b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line"], "esrb_rating": null}
