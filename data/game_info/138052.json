Can\u2019t wait to play some of those games!</p>\n<p>Kessler Syndrome is a fun little game about launching satellites and stations into orbit while trying to not collide with the ones already up there. The game is based off of a real life theory that eventually space will become to crowded for us to fully utilise it. In the game, the player must pace their shots and spread out their satellite trajectories to avoid collision. Too many collisions will get your funding cut and your career will end. The game can quickly become hectic and challenging so plan ahead to see your career through to the end. Assuming that it actually does end\u2026 Perhaps?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m pretty proud of my programmer art as it turned out a lot better than expected. Hoping for this one to be my best Ludum Dare yet! Good luck to everyone!</p>\n<p>Wasn\u2019t originally planning on entering the Compo but since the game was pretty much finished and the Quill stream chat said I should, I did!

Cheers!</p>\n<p>\u201cKessler Syndrome (also called the Kessler effect, collisional cascading or ablation cascade), proposed by the NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in low earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade where each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges infeasible for many generations.\u201d - Wikipedia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/619350de4a98f199a383d2f7b3950427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Rytannic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
