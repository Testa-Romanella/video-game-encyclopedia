My game is called \"How to anoy your\u00a0owners\". The essence of the game is to do as many dirty tricks as possible and the owner did not notice you. To destroy everything in its path, tear down walls and so on. The idea was mine, I immediately started to implement it. I've been programming and developing games for a year, I've always lived it and I want to develop in it. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to implement the game to the end. I didn't add the owners themselves, didn't make an apartment, managed to make only one room. I decided to make the game in the \"anti-stress\" format - this is to demolish everything that you see on your way, animation of how we tear down walls in the role of a cat. Next, many different levels will be added (different apartments, houses, different owners and cats) and increase the difficulty level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T09:51:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a5/9a56c8d68928b724115fa43f514d2c37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rustkoff"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
