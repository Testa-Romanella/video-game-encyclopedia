This year for ArtFight I thought i'd do something special for an attack, and since my two favorite events of the year were happening at the same time I figured why not mash the two together!</p>\n<p>Due to collabs not being allowed on ArtFight, i've created everything on my own (expect for the music/ambience). All the character's models, animations,\u00a0 and textures, as well as the environment and programming were all done by me!</p>\n<p>Though My First Game Jam will be over, ArtFight continues on into August so I plan on developing and adding even more characters in until then! Keep a watch out for updates~</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Models, Textures, Voices and Design -\u00a0<strong>Spottedphyre</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Special Thanks to:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Grinjr</li><li>Kay2036</li><li>Starwhiskers</li><li>Hellion</li><li>Chvrch</li><li>All of the ArtFight Mod Team</li></ul>\n<p>Song Credits:</p>\n<p>Kidz Bop Kids: All Star<br/>Kidz Bop Kids: Funkytown<br/>Kidz Bop Kids: I'm a Believer<br/>Cafe Music BGM Channel: Morning Sun Cafe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:47:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb52aa263cc7bbf7457ca3e0eac305d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Spottedphyre"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
