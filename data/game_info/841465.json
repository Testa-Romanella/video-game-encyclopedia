I personally love Norse Mythology and decided to create this game around a spirit who is on an adventure to Valhalla and has to climb his way through each realm which is governed by gods like Odin, Thor, Freya etc.</p>\n<p>The game was made for a second-year project. We were only given the requirement of two levels but with time I did feel like I could make this game a lot better and more entertaining.\u00a0 I may come back to it and fix it up when I find the time.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NB:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The sound option does not work and on launch, the game is quite loud.\u00a0The only way to turn the game down is through sound options in the windows tab.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T10:33:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d5/1d5d2be430f6bbaac184544ee4977c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leachi Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
