Elemental Engagements is a split screen, versus, real-time-strategy game. Gain favor with the elemental gods to use their 16 powers, battle on 3 maps, and play with either Keyboard or Controller!<h3>Elemental God Powers</h3>As a major wind god, you'll wield wind powers. However, winning the favor of the other gods will grant you fire, water, and earth god powers.<br/>Use wind to control the battlefield! Use fire to damage your opponent! Use water to support your units! Use earth to deny enemy movement!<br/><br/><h3>Sacrifice and Gain Favor</h3>As a match progresses, you can choose which elements you will sacrifice your thralls to. The more territory you capture, the more favor and god powers you will gain for the associated elements, but you can only have a limited amount! This means that no game will play the same and each player must choose their sacrifices wisely.<br/><br/><h3>Pick Up &amp; Play</h3>Elemental Engagements is a progressively-faster paced game on match by match basis. This means that most matches will last 5-20 minutes. The controls are designed specifically for the gamepad and split-screen gameplay, so RTS veterans and casual players alike will find tons of fun and room to strategize!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-12T07:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/034d50e233f3d5b1c9e9710a805158c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unpronounceable Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Unpronounceable Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
