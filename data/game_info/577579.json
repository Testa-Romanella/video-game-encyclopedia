Battle Tag takes the classic game of tag and adds an asymmetrical twist which makes for an interesting,\u00a0dynamic experience.\u00a0Each time you get tagged by the enemy,\u00a0they get a point. Each time you collect a disc on the field, you get a point. Whoever has more points\u00a0by the end of the round wins. Each round is 30 seconds and the difficulty is pretty tough but a fair challenge.\u00a0The tagger has many ways of movement and changing the play field to keep you on the move. If tag had a boss fight, this would be it. Get to it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T09:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60e/60e5fa70eed996a1ebf85dbd21eafe18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jay Shippey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
