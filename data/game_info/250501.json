From here on out you take your chances as you attempt to conquer the highest Peaks and Canyons.<br/><br/>Race against time as you perform flips, cannonballs, chicken salad, the suitcase or the elusive cross rocket. Increase your score with any of the above moves, but be sure to leave enough time to make it to the lodge, or you will be left out in the cold somewhere on top of the mountain.<br/><br/>Fun for the entire family! <br/><br/>Features include: <br/>* Challenging levels <br/>* Race against the clock (the Mummy's) <br/>* 5 in air tricks for additional points <br/>* Gather as many coins for additional points <br/>* 5 characters to choose from (male or female)<br/>* Power Boosts to help you get through challenging level <br/>* Level Skips - When you just can't get past that one level <br/><br/>Compete against your friends in our multiplayer action where you can actually see the progress of your friends on your screen!<br/><br/>To get speed simply press and hold your finger on the screen when going downhill and release when going uphill.
