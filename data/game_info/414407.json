The only problem is your owners have been getting after you about digging holes in the backyard. That means you'll only have one shot at digging the bone up. You'll have to use your nose to see how far you are from the spot where the bone is buried. You don't want to go around sniffing everywhere though because your owners may catch on to what you're trying to do. Best of luck and happy hunting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:41:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac2c0f592918a02f6723b202f9aa823b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Armadillq"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
