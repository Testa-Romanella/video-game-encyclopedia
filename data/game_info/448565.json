{"id": 448565, "slug": "a-proof-of-concept", "name": "A Proof of Concept", "name_original": "A Proof of Concept", "description": "<p>I\u2019ve been an existential mess since the impacts of Coronavirus have settled in, and was spiraling to a very dark and emotional place. For a while, I was able to get by playing a number of games that had come and gone in the last handful of years that I had missed, and I coped my way through most of April reasonably well.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>For whatever reason, things quickly started going downhill. Games I had been able to rely on for years simply were not fun anymore. I couldn\u2019t speedrun Mario 64, I was struggling to play my placements in Overwatch, and every game I tried I simply just couldn\u2019t get into. Without games, on top of the lack of sports and society, I really did not have a semi-healthy vice to channel through.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>While this descent was occurring, I became more and more enthralled reading about Toby Fox and his development process for Undertale. As simply designed as the game was, its message really resonated with me, and I couldn\u2019t believe it had been made by 1 person in GameMaker in a reasonable amount of time. We have a similar background and education, and the more I understood about the game\u2019s construction, the more the idea of trying consumed me.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I took the plunge on a Monday afternoon at the end of April and thought what the hell, it\u2019ll give me something to do. I have done application programming professionally for several years, and taught object oriented programming at college, but had never worked on a game in any way. I had a one month trial, and I thought that would give me enough time to legitimately attempt to see if I could do this.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>After a week or so of tutorials, things started to really click. Within two weeks, there were very few things from a functional perspective I wasn\u2019t able to accomplish. The coding itself became creative, I enjoyed finding solutions to what I wanted to implement. There were times I legitimately felt this game was designing itself. I felt fulfilled and energized in a way I hadn\u2019t in months.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I blew past my original goals, and today, with hours left on my trial license, I feel I have put together something resembling a complete experience. Not a full game, and not necessarily a demo of the game I would ultimately like to make. But a proof of concept for an outline of something bigger. I think it truly has promise, but I am blinded by my own bias. I need you to tell me if I\u2019m on to something or whether this should remain a pleasant side hobby.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I wanted this game to be simple, and based on a few core principles I think this Proof of Concept gets across reasonably well. To summarize, I wanted this game to have:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>The platforming accuracy of Celeste, while not simply being a platforming gauntlet. I wanted this game to first and foremost be about fun and rewarding movement principles, but still be a story driven experience\r\n  </li><li>The exploration of a Metroidvania ala Hollow Knight / Super Metroid. A world to explore connecting a number of levels and hubs. This is one of the concepts that I think struggles the most to show in this POC simply due to lack of time. In a full game, it would be a central basis\r\n  </li><li>The knowledge as power mechanic most exemplified by Outer Wilds. I want there to be a number of major areas that interact and expand on one another while still being independent experiences. Each place would provide clues as to how to access more information and content\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>There are aspects I was not able to show mostly due to the time constraint I set myself, such as building out a few characters with depth and impact. I also would have liked to spend more time working on nuanced art strategies, but for now I am getting by completely on free materials. Besides the $5 I spent on real MP3s, I have invested nothing other than time and effort in this.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>With that in mind, if you think this sounds of interest to you, I would ask you try this experience out and keep the following central questions in mind:\r\n  </p>\n<ol><li>Could this gameplay and design style conceptually carry a full game?\r\n  </li><li>Is the game well-paced? The first two levels serve as conceptual introductions, and the last several I believe are truly challenging. However, I have been playing this for a month and can no longer be an impartial judge\r\n  </li><li>Do the music choices fit the scenario they are accompanying?   </li><li>Are any of the hints too obvious? Too abstract?\r\n  </li><li>What do you think of this game???\r\n  </li></ol>\n<p>If you\u2019ve read my spiel, you have already done more than I could ever reasonably ask for.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I\u2019m asking for your help. I really hope it ends up being an enjoyable experience for you.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Full Game walkthrough in glorious 480p:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_BtMgkonw</p><p>1.1 Update:\u00a0Arrow key movement added in addition to WASD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6086bf50939ce7b99d164e62ad139d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AProofOfConcept"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
