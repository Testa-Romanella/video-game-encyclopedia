Well, the reason is that I just can't affor the google play payment to upload it and it takes many time to set everything up on google play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know it's not best game of the year not even best game of the week, but just playing it and watching some little ads <strong>you help me getting the money I need to develop my next big project</strong>. (Donations are avaliable too) (VR-experience project)</p>\n<p>I also have my webpage (\u00a0https://javiercordero.github.io/Videogames/\u00a0) just if you want to see what kind of games I develop and if you want to try any of them<strong> for free</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time</strong> and your help and hope you like the game even a bit.\u00a0<br/><br/>Javier Cordero.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T06:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99c/99c5b935e986ee827c451a31fab6bfe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Javier Cordero"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
