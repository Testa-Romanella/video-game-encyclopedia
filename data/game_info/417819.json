Most time i wrote scripts. There are no textures or 3d models in this game, except unity build-in capsules, boxes and etc. I made music in my last 20 minutes with   BeepBox and Bfxr sites.<br/></p>\n<p>music1 | music2 |\u00a0GitHub | itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d81a74a3531c7e7b5c237a73455f757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TupiNUMBooR"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
