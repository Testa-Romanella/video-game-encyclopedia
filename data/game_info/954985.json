Nevertheless, I think it came out better than I hoped given the time! The difficulty rating could be improved.</p>\n<p>Rules and controls are in the game intro, but some clarifications:</p>\n<ul><li>Touching an orange orb will reduce your health and does not collect it. You can collect it to remove it from the path but this causes more damage.</li><li>In the light zone, the green orb will increase your health but you must collect it.</li><li>Blue breadcrumbs show where you have been in the dark zone.</li><li>Each portal will take you to the light zone, and you can only return to the dark zone using that same portal. Once used, it vanishes.</li><li>Red portals with a no entry sign in the light zone show where the portals exist in the dark zone (you cannot use them in the light zone).</li><li>Pressing ENTER in the light zone will return you to the portal you came from.</li><li>The exit is marked with a dark wall and green circle in the light zone, but can only be accessed from the dark zone.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T11:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/676/676ac15bd5d1f9b6f01022a2146b700b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["x3t10"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
