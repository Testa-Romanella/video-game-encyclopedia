As it was made in a short amount of time with very limited art assistance (and zero musician assistance), it's incredibly short and\u00a0kind of a mess. I plan to add a bit more to it after the jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T07:12:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ade/ade2f3d5dd2019fa2a20ee497022112f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HitlersaurusChrist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
