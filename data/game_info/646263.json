I was quite busy this weekend so only had an afternoon available but I really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>Gameplay video:</strong></p><p>https://twitter.com/OwenGreenaway/status/1421953389781557252<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Headsets:</strong></p>\n<p>I tested the CodePen link on my Quest 2. I think this will work on all headsets. I haven't tested the HTML file updated to itch.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>A short casual virtual reality game where you have to grab the planets that look like Earth, while not grabbing the planets that look like Mars.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>Your home world is being destroyed! You need to search the galaxy for a potential new home.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Use the purple box between your controllers to highlight potential worlds (Earth) and press either trigger. Find as many potential worlds as you can before the time runs out. Don't tag the barren worlds (Mars)!</p>\n<p><strong>Textures:</strong></p>\n<p>I created the basic Earth, Mars and Sky textures. They were meant to be placeholders and I was planning on going back and improving them but I ran out of time</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I recorded some notes from my guitar. Each planet plays a note. The Earth-like planets play notes in the E scale and I hoped that would sound quite nice. The mars planets play a note outside the E scale and I hoped this would sound bad and indicate that you had selected the wrong type. This didn't really work but I ran out of time to try recording other notes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T10:25:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03ae537ad0ab8597982b58c959474fa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["owengreenaway"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
