To get your identity back, you'll have to <strong>explore </strong>a strange, hand-painted world, <strong>befriend</strong> other travelers,<strong> trade</strong> goods and information and <strong>conspire </strong>against the Sun Himself. Will you ask for His pardon, or try to defy Him?<br/></p>\n<p>This is a <strong>playable teaser</strong> we released for our Kickstarter campaign. It lacks mechanics and visual polish, and it's much more linear than the main game, but it should give you a taste of the kind of gameplay you should expect from the complete experience. <strong>We hope you'll enjoy it!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>________________________________</p>\r\nTHE TEAM\r\n<p><strong>Chiara</strong> - Background artist: twitter.com/cornopardo<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Anita</strong> - Character artist: twitter.com/anitakajika<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Giada</strong> - Everything else: twitter.com/brica6rac <br/></p>\r\nALSO HELPING\r\n<p><strong>Lucy</strong> - Sprite artist: twitter.com/lucyrawrs</p>\n<p><strong>Devin</strong> - Composer: twitter.com/tbluesun <br/></p>\n<p>________________________________\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/8379946b43d968e2dfd7a1947fb8c178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bricabrac"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
