Armed with a glue gun, players will face each other cleverly by sticking their opponents to the moving platforms of the map to take them into the \"crusher\" that will kill them. To win,\u00a0 be the last survivor! As a chicken you can use your wings at their best to float for a little bit of time each time you are in the air. You can put some glue on the platforms to stick another chicken who walks into it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n\r\nGameplay :\r\n<p><strong>Your misson: Be the last chicken man in the fight</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Doomsday of chicken:</strong> The end of the world is near and as a chicken, you are too dumb to do something useful.

We've made this project during the GodfatherWeek 2019, a game jam organised by our school regrouping every\u00a0video game students inside the school. The Theme was centered around the word \"Legacy\", in order to answer that theme, every team\u00a0had to share an object that was supposed to be visible in game\u00a0with another group in order to form a continuity between every team in the game jam.\u00a0 We gave the object \"the glue gun\" and we received the \"chicken\" word.\u00a0</p>\r\nOur Team :\u00a0\r\n<p>-\u00a0 Producer : BOUCHARD Maximilien - TIRANT Eliott</p>\n<p>- Game Designer : FROMANGE-GONIN Eloi - BOINE Florian- LETOURNEUR Florian</p>\n<p>- Game Artist : PORISSE Emily - MARRASS\u00c9 Colin</p>\n<p>- Developer : BLAZY Elliot</p>\n<p>- Sound Designer : SCHLUME Octave</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074d89364d0bb9c246fbfa86f2d5b688.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Habide"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
