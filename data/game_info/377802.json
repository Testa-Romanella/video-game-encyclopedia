With over 30 episodes, it was one of the longest running tv shows never to\u00a0enter syndication.

I've created this game to draw attention to the fact that The Seinfeld has never been released on DVD.</p>\n<p>This is not promotional advertising.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T07:02:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea22b8b5aac998b7202384ba0a7ad141.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DelaneyB"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
