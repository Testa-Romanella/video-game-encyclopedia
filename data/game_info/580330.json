Here in Hollow, you must play as different characters to unlock what\u2019s actually going on rather than what you're told is going on. Starting as a child in the manor, you have a strict curfew to avoid the lurking shadowy monsters\u200a\u2014\u200ado these monsters even exist? While investigating different rooms your character may die, however, this will bring you one step closer to the truth as you revive as a different character from the same manor. This being said, you will no longer be a tiptoeing child restricted in your own room but rather you may have some authority in the house\u2026die and you shall see!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Forest Anderson, Sam Haskins, Adrien Gergouil, Jake Diedrich, Veronica Yung, Ben Barbeau, Evan Maxted</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2db148e66b736fe57a3f8d72aac238a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vSmiles"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
