Each household is specially marked for easy recognition of what they should receive: a blue exclamation mark for those who have been nice, a red exclamation mark for those who have been naughty, and a stick of dynamite for those who need some extra Christmas cheer! Avoid rockets fired from missile launchers dotted around the map that are trying to keep you from giving Christmas spirit!<h3>Story</h3>'Tis the night of Christmas, and all through the town, not a person was scurrying, even the adults in the house. Then, in the sky came a jingle of bells! \"Quick!\" the captain says, \"Arm the missiles and cover the wells!\" The missiles came to life and targeted the sound; ready to blast this trespasser into the ground! Santa looked down at the chaos below, he wanted nothing more than just to go. But he knew there were kids who needed their presents, so he sped forward with the speed of a phoenix! The missiles launched and the captain yelled, but nothing would stop Santa from spreading Christmas Cheer!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T03:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/306de0000cffb2c7145c6f7da23ed37f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Zoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Zoo"], "esrb_rating": null}
