{"id": 100280, "slug": "tubulance", "name": "Tubulance", "name_original": "Tubulance", "description": "<p>Tubulance is an arcade-style infinite flight/dodge-em-up indie game, currently in development. The focus is on a sense of speed, with simple but challenging gameplay. Obstacles fly out along the inside of the tube, and two buttons are used to avoid them. The speed increases continuously, and the obstacles are arranged into larger unique patterns, each with some randomized feature, keeping players on their toes. The hypnotic, high-speed effect is accompanied by a pumping soundtrack by electronic musician Aero. Tubulance's design philosophy supports short rounds of play and instant retries, which has been referred to as \"infectious\". It only ever takes sixty seconds to beat your highscore!<br/></p><p>Video: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAmY5GfIYHw</p><p>SEIZURE WARNING - </p><p>FLASHING BACKGROUNDS AND PATTERNS !!!</p><p>Play with arrows, or F+J, or D+L. </p><p>Alt+enter to fullscreen.</p><p>If you find the beginning too easy, use the Konami code to start at 30,000 points. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8d/d8d0fc0cbe3d2677c4463146d2fefb5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["merteor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
