As a result, the project's funding and our technical capacity are limited. You may have insufficient play or even procedural flaws in the course of the game. We will do our best to improve the problems exposed in the game, but there is still the possibility of not meeting your psychological expectations, which you will know.<br/><br/>      Whether you decide to support our game or not, we appreciate you reading our introduction to the game. Because it's all a small endorsement of the game in our opinion.<br/><br/>      While we're eager for the game to have your support, we'd like to see the quality of the game itself make your purchase decision.<br/><br/>      Therefore, if you do not like this game or the game has serious program problems, I hope you can apply for a refund in time. A game that never opens should not remain in your game library.<br/>      If you have the opportunity, I hope you will actively present your views on the game in the comments area, any criticism and praise you have is priceless.
