Best of three, the Game! <br/> <br/>Here's the catch... The Queen has armed her own champion with a flamingo fit for battle. The Spade however, must make do with a most uncooperative bird. <br/> </p><p>Player 1 (Spade)</p><p>==============<br/>Left : Retreat <br/>Right : Advance <br/>Up : Jump <br/>X : Thrust (holding Down for a low attack) <br/>C : Parry </p><p>Player 2 (Heart)</p><p>==============<br/>Mouse (movement): Retreat, Advance, Jump</p><p>Mouse (click): Attack (when cursor is White)<br/></p><p> <br/>press \"R\" to Reset. <br/> <br/>======================== <br/>Here's how scoring works: <br/>======================== <br/> <br/>-Hitting your opponent with your flamingo's beak scores you a Point. The page (white rabbit) raises a flag indicating which payer scores first. <br/> <br/>-The painter on the left keeps track of Points by painting roses (black for you, red for the heart). First to 3 Points wins the Match. <br/> <br/>-The King of Hearts keeps track of the Match winner, raising a sign for heart or spade. This triggers the painter on the right. Best of 3 Matches wins the Game. <br/> <br/> </p><p>========================<br/>Notes for the Spade: <br/>========================<br/> X and C (thrusting and blocking) will result in different motions based on the location/orientation of your flamingo's head/beak. Experiment to find the best times to attack or defend <br/> <br/>Trouble scoring points? Try following up a jump with a low attack, or thrusting after a well timed parry. <br/> <br/> If your flamingo gets tangled, mashing buttons may help.</p><p>Game seem unfair?
