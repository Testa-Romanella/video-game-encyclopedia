No health bar or timer, but <strong>anxiety </strong>levels and <strong>unemployment </strong>meter.</p>\n<p>Quick how to play:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ANXIETY</strong>: Timed. If you get too anxious, will start to break stuff. You can find coffee, chocolate, soda or medicine to lower your anxiety. If it goes full, you die.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>UNEMPLOYMENT</strong>: When you break stuff, it rises. You can find lost office papers, pencils, etc to lower it. If it goes full, you get a <em>little</em> crazier...</p>\n<p><strong>ETC:</strong> Move with WASD or\u00a0arrows (S or down arrow turns in place), jump with space or crouch with C.\u00a0 There is a key in a specific room, and you have to find it to open the stairs and get to the exit. The compass will guide you to the current objective.</p>\n<p><strong>ATTACK:</strong> with left mouse click or left Ctrl, aim is automatic when enemy gets into range.

He just started in a new job, in a big, tall and important company. He wanted to impress his boss, so he spent all day writing reports and didn't have time to smoke a single cigarette. With so much to do, he is now alone and lost in building he know nothing about. Only you can help John find his way out for a smoke before he loses his mind.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR ADDICTION?</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1cbb3d445da36a7599b4f0ff239067.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Nonsense Bull Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
