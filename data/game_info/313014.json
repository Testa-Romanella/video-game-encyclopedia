It is said that its flight is powered by state-of-the art anti-gravity boots\u2026 But in a time where resources are scarcer than ever, is that technology really sustainable ?</em></p>\n<p><strong>In Cloudwalker, your goal is to spot incoming ennemies. Day after day, you will receive new communications from your commander. Keep in mind that flying is not free : watch your energy level closely.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Communicate with your commander day after day.</li><li>Watch out for ennemies from your aerial position.</li><li>Keep track of intruders with your cursor to pinpoint them. Past a certain number of identified ennemies, the story will move on.</li><li>Reach the end of the game and discover secrets !</li></ul>\n<p><strong>This game was developed with mobile VR (Cardboard) in mind. </strong>As such, even in the HTML5 version, all interactions are based on the direction you are aiming for.
