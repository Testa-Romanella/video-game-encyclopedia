No guarantees that it works with other VR headsets, sorry! The theme was <strong>OPPOSITES</strong>, this is seen in the game by the fact that you cannot combine opposite elements when spellcasting, and to defeat the wizard you must\u00a0 negate his spells by casting with the opposite elements.<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS: All programming + level design was done by me, many assets were found online (all with the appropriate licenses).
