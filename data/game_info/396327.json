{"id": 396327, "slug": "frog-and-croc", "name": "Frog and Croc", "name_original": "Frog and Croc", "description": "<p>Frog and Croc is a retro-style 3D platformer based on the concept of controlling 2 characters with different abilities. The player must swap between playing as Frog and Croc as they navigate the environment and collect all of the golden clams. Solve navigational puzzles, fight enemies, and platform your way across the island! </p>\r\n\r\nNotes About Playing\r\n<p>\r\n    Frog and Croc is built to be played on either Windows or Mac operating systems.

It has 4 main areas with a few side areas on it. The first area is the starting area. This area is a safe place for the player to try out the controls and learn how the game plays. The second area is the forest level. This area is where the player will encounter the first set of basic enemies. The third area is the beach level. This area contains the first time the player will find Exploder Enemies and destroyable rocks. The last area is the Volcano. This has an outside and inside area to it. All types of enemies will be found on the Volcano.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nEnemies\r\nBasic Tiki\r\n\n<p>\r\n    This enemy is the most common enemy you will come across.    It is easily defeated with a single attack, however, it is normally found in groups. They will follow the player until they are close enough then lunge at the play and damage the player on contact for one health point.\r\n</p>\r\nExploder Tiki\r\n\n<p>\r\n    This enemy is found spawning in caves in specific areas around the island. This enemy can not be killed by basic attacks. To defeat this enemy, they must blow up. When attacked the exploder will be stunned and spinning in place. Croc is able to pick up the exploder while in the stunned state. The timer for the explosion is paused and you can then throw the exploder at another enemy or at the brown boulders which can only be destroyed this way.\r\n</p>\r\nArmored Tiki\r\n\n<p>\r\n    This enemy is the most rare enemy to find on the island. It serves as a mini boss at specific parts of the island. The Armored enemy can only be attacked on the red weak spot on the back of him. When he attacks he will stay stunned for a short period of time before moving after the player and attacking again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nGame Play Videos\r\n<p>This video is a full game playthrough.
