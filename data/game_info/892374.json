The vessel, empowered with abnormal energy, has the ability to traverse a post-apocalyptic world, fight enemies previously thought invincible, and relearn lost arts through fragments of history, locked away and guarded by fearsome enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use A/D to move left and right, Space to jump, 'K' to swing your weapon, and 'Q' and 'R' to use abilities after gaining them from the respective bosses</p>\n<p><strong>What went right</strong></p>\n<p>The initial development and set up allowed our group to experiment and find good concepts and ideas for both the player and the respective bosses, the core gameplay loop we went for was consistent for the entire project which allowed us to be more proactive about implementing ideas and our general organization was well maintained up until the near end.</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Time constraints, time constraints, time constraints. A lot of major issues we had happened halfway through the set working period for the project or worse, some examples being our Production Artist left our group without a word halfway through development taking all assets they made with them as such, the rest of the group had little time to implement graphics and work on their respective parts, causing the unfinished visual. Another big issue that happened near the end was the concept art developed caused major issues on importing and addition because of severe miscommunications on dimensions, imports, and implementation of collision systems which meant most of the prepared assets didnt make it to the final product and a fair amount of mechanics were left relatively clunky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:01:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d3943e06a8854f48e8f3dd5d8ae0742c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrevorRaposo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
