To win you have to make your opponent fall of their platform and into the abyss. The only way to do this is to remove parts of the platform by shooting at it. Only a red bullet can destroy the ground, a bullet have to bounce once to become red. But be careful your opponent will shoot back.<br/></p>\n<p>You also have to keep moving, if you stand still the ground under you will be removed.</p>\n<p>There is a forcefield between you and your opponent to keep you from jumping over, don\u2019t worry your bullets will pass right thru.</p>\n<p>Your gun can only have three active bullets at a time, so try not to be to trigger happy.</p>\n<p>The game has three difficulties that affect how many opponents you will have to face. </p>\n<p>**Update**</p><p>Finally got time to make a MacOS and Linux build. I have never done that before and I don't have access to Linux or Mac to test them, but hopefully I got it right. :)</p><p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD- Move</li><li>Mouse - Aim</li><li>Left Mouse - Shoot</li><li>Jump - Space</li><li>Esc - Pause</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c03aa42985354908f79e44dbb48a3824.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ZenriS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
