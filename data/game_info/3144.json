Meat Boy has to save Bandage Girl from Doctor Fetus, by completing the platforming challenges. The game has 5 main worlds, each consisting of 20 light levels, 20 dark and harder versions of those levels and a boss fight. Meat Boy has only one life and cannot take any damage, but there is no limit on attempts, so players can try and fail the stage until they get it right or collect special bandages. Unique replay system will show the player every try they made at the same time right after they completed the level.<br />\nSuper Meat boy has multiple characters, some of them are a different skin for Meat Boy and in-game adaptations of other indie-game protagonists, that can be unlocked by completing their special challenge levels, hidden somewhere in the campaign; or by collecting set amount of bandages. Players will be able to choose any unlocked character for any level from the main menu. The game gives players access to the community created maps, but even without it \u2013 Super Meat Boy offers more than 300 levels.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2010-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e04/e04963f3ac4c4fa83a1dc0b9231e50db.jpg", "website": "http://www.supermeatboy.com", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 334, "owned": 6786, "beaten": 752, "toplay": 136, "dropped": 1177, "playing": 86}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 84, "ratings_count": 1723, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1734, "platforms": ["Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "Wii U", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "Android", "Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios", "Team Meat"], "genres": ["Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "BlitWorks"], "esrb_rating": null}
