Follow the self-named cat burglar, Schwarzschild, as he delves deeper into the strangest and most dangerous corners of the city on behalf of a mysterious patron who has granted him superhuman abilities in exchange for a handful of heists. Enter multi-floor dungeons filled with enemies and traps and use Schwarzschild\u2019s superior mobility to out-maneuver adversaries and counter attack with wells of concentrated gravity that disrupt and manipulate the environment around them.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, with each job it becomes more apparent that perhaps these\u00a0abilities alone are not enough.\u00a0Perhaps Schwarzschild was not meant to make it out of this bargain alive.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Schwarzschild</em> is currently in development! This build was created as part of NYU Game Center's 2021 MFA Thesis Showcase.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5bbeab7da54b720fa52b10741e23840.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Merry Hospelhorn"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
