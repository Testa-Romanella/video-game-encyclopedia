{"id": 727825, "slug": "full-house-dice", "name": "Full House Dice", "name_original": "Full House Dice", "description": "<p><strong>RULES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Roll both dice and place their values into the 5x5 grid.  Your objective is to create poker-style combinations (3-of-a-kind,  2-pair, etc) in each row and column.\r\n             </p>\n<p>Press \"Roll dice\" to begin a turn and click on the dice  you want to place - it will turn green to let you know it's selected.  Then click where you would like to put it in the grid - your dice will  turn red to let you know it's been used. Once you have used both dice,  press \"Roll dice\" for the next round.\r\n              </p>\n<p>On a single turn, you cannot place both dice values on  the same row or column - both numbers must be placed in entirely  separate rows and columns from each other. Spaces in the play-area will  turn grey to let you know they're unavailable.\r\n             </p>\n<p>You do not have to place a dice value, if you do not want to.\r\n             </p>\n<p>After 13 rounds, each row and each column will score  points, based upon the combinations of numbers it contains. For example,  a sequence like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in any order, will score as a  5-straight. The point values are as follows:\r\n             </p>\n<ul><li>5 straight = 7pt\r\n</li><li>4 straight = 5pt\r\n</li><li>3 straight = 3pt\r\n</li><li>5 of a kind = 6pt\r\n</li><li>4 of a kind = 4pt\r\n</li><li>3 of a kind = 3pt\r\n</li><li>Pair (+) = 1pt\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Notice the \u201c+\u201d next to \u201cPair\u201d. This means that pairs can  be scored along with other sequences - ie, another pair, three of a  kind, or 3-straight. The pair must be made of values not used in another  combination on that row or column.\r\n         </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5dfdb795df7c34b30e32a968cb00b11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RobinDavid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
