To achieve that, many design choices that may appear odd at first were built upon. These are what shape the game and make it stand out from other similar titles.  Without spoiling much, one of the first things you will notice is that there is no game menu, or that you find yourself dying a lot! Don't panic, it is all as intended. Just keep at it!<br/></p>\n<p>Resuming, you'll either love it or hate it (or both). But if you can manage to reach the end, you will, hopefully, reminisce it as a gratifying walk.
