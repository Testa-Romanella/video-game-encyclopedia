Our hero Cybergeist did that, but to survive. He got cheated, and now he is a living weapon of mass destruction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The cops of all the city are hunting down Cybergeist. Their goal: kill. So run and dodge them all over the endless highway.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Collect the Burst Spheres until our hero gets full charged to activate the Burst Mode. In this mode Cybergeist is able to destroy everything on his path!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Cybergeist is a twist on the classic game with the yellow hero afraid of ghosts. Referencing other classics in the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Neon lights, big banners, terrible life. Cybergeist gets it all. A dark, and yet colorful, dystopic future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game features great electronic beats from Peritune. A catchy sound that makes you thrill over the highway.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T02:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0a66fd888a26e01464c90c3dc83528f.jpg", "website": "https://www.indigoarts.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Indigo Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Indigo Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
