Cybertopia is designed specifically thinking of people with such mindsets, so it is so super easy to understand that many players have never even read the rulebook - just know that to do stuff you roll a D20 and add bonuses from items and skills that you select from whatever you can think of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No complicated moves, just one dice needed, character creation in minutes and a learning curve so shallow I'd be surprised if anyone didn't completely get the game within the first session.</p>\n<p>Cybertopia is a near-future cyberpunk-esque TTRPG that lets players be really whatever they want to be, with whatever abilities and gear they can think of and virtually no limits to what they can\u00a0<em>try</em>\u00a0to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This 98 page pdf\u00a0contains:</p>\n<ul><li>The complete rules with everything there is to know about\u00a0playing this game and advice on running sessions and creating scenarios\u00a0</li><li>10 unique template characters and dozens of skill and item ideas</li><li>A collection of lore and world details with 10 fully fleshed out scenarios including\u00a0a fun festive mission as well as a big campaign finale to lead into a more open-world future to come! (2 new missions are currently in the works!)</li></ul>\n<p>The book is currently lacking illustrations but if this gets enough sales, a professional illustrator will be brought on board and all sold copies updated to the full art-worked version.\r\n</p>\n<p>Cybertopia is the debut TTRPG created and written by Ben Newbon in his spare time without any financial backing or publisher support. All sales go towards further developing the books with artwork and new missions/features. Please think of this when you considering purchasing from indie-solo self-publishers that you are supporting a hobbyist creative.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cce/cce5f2f6fdeafe5d3635f5dfb284eb17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Newbon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
