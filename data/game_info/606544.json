So, when Amatsuka Uto released her Angel with a shotgun cover I knew exactly what needed to happen.</p>\n<p>It's still a work in progress and I want to add many more Vtubers who I adore, but here is already a small working prototype!</p>\n<p>You can use WASD to move, press Space to jump and hold to glide. Right click will let you shoot and when you do, you be be blasted backwards which can be used to gain height or to doge a bullet. You can regain bullets by touching the ground and by hitting frenemies. (They will turn pink when shot, because they will fall in love with Uto to make it less violent^^)</p>\n<p>There are three kinds of enemies, seperated by the scuffed rooms and that's about it for now. Have fun and feedback is appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T08:13:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/461afb00d5e85742fbcf284b98133c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chouchourd"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
