This version comes with bug fixes, level design improvements, and even more gay and trans dialogue!</p>\n<p>This is a tactics game about two girlfriends, a Knight named Onyxia and a Mage named Nenna, who are being attacked by the army of  Death Emperor Anur. When they stand next to each other, the girlfriends heal, but when they're apart, the pain is so great they both take damage. Fight your way through three tactical levels, acquiring new weapons and skills while growing your characters quickly, culminating in a story about love told just as much through play as through dialogue!</p><p>--Love Tactics is created by Angie Nyx Solomon, and is her first game released since switching fully to SRPG Studio. Hopefully you'll stick around if you want to see more games like this from her!--<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a767bbec2ab195740b7a4afc3727bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NYX"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
