It's actually a gift for my mom.</p><p>It's a point-and-click game, built in Unity, available for Mac and PC.

Your \"score\" is represented by the kid's changes in appearance and environment. You can also view the progress of how many plants you've unlocked through the Plant Journal at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Art, design and coding were done by me. Music was done by two exceptionally talented composers: Steven Cravis and Alec Holowka. Sound was done by the phenomenally skilled Ryan Roth!<br/><br/>For more info, check out the official Growing landing page or the blog post I made on its release.<br/><br/>Growing in the Press:</p><ul><li>Truth In the Land of Imposters [Dork Shelf]\r\n</li><li>Freeware Pick: Growing is a developer's gift to her mother [Indie Games Blog]\r\n</li><li>Corey Nolan's Growing Is A Two Year Journey To Create A Gift For Her Mother [Indie Statik]</li><li>Weekend Download [JayIsGames]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a5b1eaa8173f9a98d25640df095e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Corey Nolan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
