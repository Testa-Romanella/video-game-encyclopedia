The game is designed such that after a point of time, the enemies become so fast that it's practically impossible to continue playing any further, thus complying with the theme of the One\u00a0Minute Jam.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Use the W,S,A,D keys for movement, and Left Shift to use your jetpack to fly. The left mouse button is used for shooting the bugs, whom you have to avoid touching.</p>\n<p>The faster you kill enemies is the faster your score increases.</p>\n<p>You die when one of the enemies collides with you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcd2bc14d7b9b34a4f773af1ede38f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["roet"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
