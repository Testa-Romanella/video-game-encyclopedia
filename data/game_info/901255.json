I am new to game development so if you experience any bugs, or issues, feel free to let me know. Also, the game is not very long, but I hope you enjoy anyways! Galaxy Adventure is a game which was created in GDevelop. The sprites, background and the whole game was made entirely by me. This was my first attempt at game development, so bugs<strong> </strong><em><strong>could become an issue while playing.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I hope you have a great experience playing it!
