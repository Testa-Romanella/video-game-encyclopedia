Though i didn't spend much time on menus so the interface is a bit rough, most of my time went into balancing\u00a0the enemies\u00a0their skills, the passive effects, the zones\u00a0and the cost of the items.</p>\n<p>This is a small game built around earning money and progression, you earn cash to get better items which lets you get through the game faster and faster, you won't be able to get through it on your first run but eventually you can reach the end and beat the final boss.</p>\n<p>The controls are the standard rpg maker controls.<br/></p>\n<p>z or enter = action button</p>\n<p>x or keypad 0 = cancel</p>\n<p>left shift or\u00a0right shift = run/speed up</p>\n<p>Right now this is a windows only file, i can use the other explorters for mac and linux\u00a0if more people show interest in it.</p>\n<p>The plan was to draw everything myself which i thought might take around half a year but then the AI stuff came out, learned it and boosted my progression real fast and i was able to learn aspects or RPGmaker\u00a0faster thanks to being able to produce faster characters, enemies and such, i still had to draw many things and fix all the issues but regardless it really helped speed things up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T06:35:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/553/553a032eb49370404cf2785dd1803bb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TGJackalope"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
