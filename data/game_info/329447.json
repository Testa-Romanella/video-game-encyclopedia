I implemented everything\u00a0 I wanted to in my game !\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Have Fun!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Leave me any bad or good comment ,\u00a0 tell me what can I do better or what I did bad.</p>\n<p>This is my 3rd game so I don't\u00a0 expect it to be a \"Hit Game\" on marketplace , but all the things I learned were worth IT!</p>\n<p>Google Play Store\u00a0\u00a0: Download</p>\n<p>studio instagram\u00a0: @pasarel.studios_</p>\n<p>personal instagram : @alexandruandriev</p>\n<p><strong>I hope you have a nice day and don't give up on anything that you do!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bf/2bf0c78fd9691fcf6cef7cd2e7e01d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pasarel Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
