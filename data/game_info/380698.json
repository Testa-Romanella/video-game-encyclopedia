I AM AWARE THERE IS ALREADY A GAME (HALFDEAD, HALFDEAD 2) THAT USES A SIMILAR THEME, BUT IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL MOVIE. I HAVE TRIED TO CAPTURE THE ATMOSPHERE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE LOGIC BEHIND THE CUBE.\u00a0\r\nMAIN WEBSITE OF THE PROJECT CAN BE FOUND\u00a0HERE.\r\n\r\n<em>CUBE IS THE DEADLIEST SHAPE</em>\n<em>RUN!</em>\n<em>YOU MIGHT ESCAPE!</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f448c12d942f67dde424e11566119de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petrzel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
