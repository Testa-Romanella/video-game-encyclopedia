This is now a public demo.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for your support and for checking out the demo of Cafe Crush.</p>\n<p>Just to clarify, this short demo does not reflect the final game, since this was released the GUI has changed quite a lot and the dialogue you see in this demo is scripted specifically for this and not all of it appears in the game, plus this demo is only partially voiced whereas the game is fully voiced.<br/></p><p>I would greatly appreciate feedback on the general gameplay and any glitches you may find.
