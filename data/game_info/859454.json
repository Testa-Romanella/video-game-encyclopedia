At that time, there were not many RPGs, and Chinese RPGs were even rarer. So every time you find a Chinese RPG, you must play it through. At that time, there were many classic Chinese (Chinese) RPGs, such as heavy aircraft soldiers, devouring heaven and earth, canonization, and so on. But there is also such a unique game, which is the real RPG \"Jing Ke Xin Zhuan\"! The familiar and magical BGM, the anti human horror cave, the huge font, and the familiar characters and maps... I believe many old players still have an impression on this game. Now, aloby studio has remade this game, and the game plot, map, dialogue and so on are completely remade according to the original version. The specific features are as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/>0. At the beginning of the game, you can choose [normal game] or [open game]. The plots of the two modes are exactly the same. The normal game is completely the same as the original version. The open game can get many unlimited props at the beginning of the game to facilitate the needs of different players. At the same time, the game has built-in detailed strategies, and is also equipped with maps of various caves and the world. You are no longer afraid of getting lost.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. The remade game screen is completely remade at a ratio of 1:1, accurate to every tree and mountain. On the basis of retaining the layout of the original FC map, the performance of the screen is relatively greatly enhanced.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2. The combat system is greatly enhanced compared with the original version. Different weapons and different skills have different attack images and sound effects. Compared with the original version, the battle background is added, the battle sound effect and the skill attack visual effect are strengthened, the enemy's shape and types are enriched, and the battle data such as critical hit and evasion can be displayed; In addition, each enemy has set up many different kinds of dropped items. After the battle, you can check the list of trophies, and there will be unexpected surprises at any time. At the same time, the game can also be switched between automatic combat and manual combat at any time, which is convenient for players in need to choose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3. The big map is completely made according to the original game 1:1. On the basis of remaking all the materials, the unreasonable problem of encountering enemies in some areas has been corrected, and villages that can only be accessed by remaking have been set up in some places.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4. Compared with the original version, we have added voice and sound effects to all controllable characters, including selected character avatars for important NPCs, and expanded more attributes in character status attributes. The original version only has three basic abilities: attack, defense and agility. The Remaking version has increased the values of military attack, military defense and poison avoidance, which correspond to the power of using skills, the defense against skills and the immunity to poisoning probability.<br/><br/><br/><br/>5. All the plot dialogues and NPC dialogues are reproduced on the basis of the original version. On the basis of keeping willing, many sick sentences are modified, and some irrelevant NPC dialogues are replaced with some information related to game clues. At the same time, the Historical Biographies of important figures are added to enrich the completeness of the plot. The most important thing is that compared with the original version of the wonderful large font, the dialogue is finally much more normal this time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>6. In the game, on the basis of retaining the original props, some original props are added. For example, gold cards that can be upgraded with money, Warring States maps that can display world maps and cave Mini maps, and Pearl fragments that can illuminate the whole cave map!<br/><br/>The biggest criticism of the original version is that it is an anti human cave. Not only is the map particularly complex and the rate of encountering enemies is high, but also you can only see the distance around you with lanterns. In those years, I don't know how many kids drew maps while playing, how many kids ran out of ammunition and food after finding items and couldn't find their way back, and how many kids were dissuaded by this terrible map... However, in the remaking, I improved it while retaining the unique charm of the original. There are three options for players to enter the hole:<br/><br/>1. Turn on the lantern to display the surrounding environment.<br/><br/>2. Use pearl fragments (available in grocery stores, or can be obtained by searching) to instantly illuminate the whole picture.<br/><br/>3. Using the newly evolved Lilou God's eye, you can instantly change the terrain of the labyrinth and turn the complex road into a super simple labyrinth with only one room and one jar! However, the price to be paid is that all the \"skills\" are used up, and there will be a special boss to protect the jar... Yes, speaking of which, I want to roast about the original version. Except for the last king of Qin, there is hardly any boss in the whole game! However, in the remaking, not only a number of bosses with different shapes and forms were added, they were not only famous generals (or beauties...) in the Warring States period, but also they could gain good experience, money and equipment by defeating them. However, there are gains and losses. If you use Lilou's eye to change the labyrinth terrain and easily obtain important props, you can't get some treasure chest items in the cave again. How to choose is up to the player in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>7. Compared with the original version, the game not only adds props that illuminate the whole picture of the cave, but also increases the moving speed of the character. There are even shoes that can walk at four times the speed (much faster than the original fairy shoes). Classic props such as fairy shoes and feather shoes also have corresponding special functions, such as preemptive strike, halving the enemy encounter rate and other additional attributes. In addition, the drama prop nightpearl can also be used, which is equivalent to the unlimited use of Pearl fragments. From now on, you can walk freely in the cave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>8. Compared with the original version, some brand-new skills have been added in the game, such as the golden seal method, which can obtain double money and double explosion rate in a certain time, and make money and treasure without mistake; The original version of liunie method, which had little effect, was changed to detoxification method. Qin Wuyang has also newly added many of his exclusive skills, as well as many lines that are not in the original version.<br/><br/><br/><br/>9. The effects of all props have been improved, and the power of skills has also been greatly improved compared with the original version. Many small details and the acquisition of the ultimate equipment are waiting for you to explore.<br/><br/><br/><br/>10. Compared with the original version, the remake adds a large number of hidden props, which may be money, goods, equipment... They are scattered in the corners of the town, fields, pots, tables and other places. When you travel around the city, you can investigate everywhere and have an unexpected harvest at any time. Compared with the original cave, it is large and empty, and the complex route often has only one manna or detoxifying grass. Remaking has greatly increased the number of pots in the cave, from manna to hot pot, from thousand mile horse liver to Ji Ren's good hand, and hundreds of taels of random money, so that your cave exploration journey is no longer monotonous and there are surprises everywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>11. Compared with the original version, the casino in the town is also brand-new and improved. You can not only get money, but also get various props. If you get more expensive props and don't need them for the time being, you can sell them for money!<br/><br/><br/><br/>12. The original version of the item column can only carry a limited number of props, and the remade version can carry more. For example, manna only occupies one position, and can carry up to 20 (shown as manna * 20). Other props can also carry many on the premise of only occupying one position. In addition, the savings office in the city has evolved into a depository, which can temporarily store all kinds of items that can not be taken away, avoiding the embarrassment of reluctant to sell when encountering too many props.<br/><br/><br/><br/>13. In order to follow the charm of the original version, most of the music and pictures in the remake are still familiar with the formula and taste. Looking at and listening to those things with a special sense of time will certainly remind you of your wonderful childhood memories!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T04:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/117da50c9818e72650c7b2921e37a8e6.jpg", "website": "https://space.bilibili.com/40613479", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u827e\u9732\u6bd4\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["\u827e\u9732\u6bd4\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
