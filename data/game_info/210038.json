From the main menu you can view high scores, continue a game that you previously exited from the pause screen or start a new game. When starting a new game you first enter your name that will be displayed in the high score listings then select done. A new game will now begin. The objective is simple, use your character to pop as many balloons as you can without missing the trampoline. A score modifier is applied to each consecutive balloon you pop in a single bounce. Missing the trampoline will cost you one of your lives and reset your avatar unless you are out of lives in which case the game is over.</p>\n<p>Use A and D to move horizontally<br/>Use W as you hit the trampoline\u00a0 to boost your bounce<br/>Use S to increase your air resistance and slow down<br/>Use O to pause the game</p>\n<p>As always any and all feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea9ed9d3664a1d4b534cf39175f73ab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Menacer20"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
