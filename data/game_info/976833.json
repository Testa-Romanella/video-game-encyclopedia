Compete against your community to stand on stage with your streamer. Practice good teamwork through proximity chat and represent what kind of frog you are. Make the stand for your team and streamer for the whole world to see who really has the best and strongest online community. Meet the viewers you see spamming in chat and hopefully they don't spam you ingame. Come to StreamerVille and get the social life you never had.
