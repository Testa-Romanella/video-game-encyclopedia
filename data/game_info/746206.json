Navigate him through this dream world, and uncover secrets hidden within his art. What awaits you when the Angel\u2019s Trumpet blows?</p>\n<p>Dev notes:<br/></p>\n<p><em>AAAAAAAAAAAA! It was our first game jam, please be kind! This is also our first time using RPG Maker MV and we learned SO much thanks to a ton of great tutorials on YouTube. Shout out to Echo607 and SRDude for carrying us through so much of what we needed to learn.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Blue: </strong>AAA this was my first game in addition to being my first game jam so that was an interesting experience! but i'm glad i was able to work with Cranes to get this done. I want to make another bigger game with RPG Maker MV so, this was great practice with the program and very eye opening for what actually needs to be done. Really pleased with the results even if I\u00a0did break the game at literally the last minute. But it's okay because we got the submission in and another page with the right build :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Cranes:</strong> I've been wanting to take the leap and make a game for so long, and finally after putting it off I decided to goad Blue into doing it. Super happy with what we ended up churning out, writing for a game was an interesting and fun experience. 10/10 would not crunch at 6am again! (Probably will.) There was a lot of fun flower language I got to play around with, and fans of the game IDV will enjoy this more with subtle (not so subtle?) nods to the original. I love Edgar a lot, so this is my sad love letter to him. Red is in fact, a gentle color.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Blue: takumitown\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cranes: flyhinata</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Yanfly</p>\n<p>Galv's RPG Maker Scripts &amp; Plugins</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-suspense-dark-ambient-8413/</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/28497/</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/28500/</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/30482/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11d/11d2341a728d066929ec62fa1598b606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bluecranes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
