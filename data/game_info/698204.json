If you'd like to retrieve it, it's available in TINY HOPES_Data &gt; Streaming Assets</strong></p>\r\nWhat were you inspired by?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<p>We were mainly inspired by\u00a0people who make up our support network, those who believe in us regardless of the circumstances. Mainly our family and close friends.\u00a0We were also inspired by a lot of wholesome games like Virtual Cottage and Kind Words as they involve a home where even if you as the player are alone in it,\u00a0it feels warm and filled with wholesome emotions. Lofi was\u00a0definitely\u00a0another media we were inspired by, it helps those who listen to it help feel calm while staying focused, getting us into the great mindset we desire.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nWhat sort of experience/message are you hoping your game will bring across to the player?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\n<p>\u00a0Everything will be alright. We wanted to empathize\u00a0and touch on something unseen but surprisingly quite common which is the eerie unsettling and suffocating\u00a0loneliness\u00a0because of the current pandemic where\u00a0people, especially of those who are exposed to Covid 19 and have\u00a0to\u00a0self-isolate.\u00a0The unconscious feeling that you are stuck in that small room\u00a0indefinitely\u00a0makes it feel that there\u2019s no hope in that moment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>But family, friends, or even yourself can be sources of happiness during this turbulent time. The everyday heroes can be those who bring cheer in what little ways they can, and receive cheer themselves in turn.\u00a0 Art is one of the ways this positivity can be spread \u2013 looking through wonderful pieces online that inspire others to create and be creative. In turn, the artist receives affirmation and encouragement from those who take the time to admire their artwork, creating a small community of positivity and inspiration to pursue dreams in art and creating a better, beautiful digital world.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nWhy did you end up choosing this direction for your game?\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>With the theme of \u2018everyday heroes\u2019, many would immediately bring to attention groups such as frontline workers, cleaners, delivery drivers, and other types of\u00a0people we often take for granted. We wanted to bring out something less common and more personal to highlight how everyday heroes can even be\u00a0those who impact us in subtle ways, and how creative expression can be a catalyst\u00a0to bring hope during harsh times.</p>\r\nCreative Director Notes -\u00a0Timothi Ellim:\r\n\r\n<p><em>TINY HOPES is modeled after our game jam team's own struggles with selecting a creative arts field as our full-time job after graduating or when transitioning jobs. This is what we love to do on a daily basis. This is why we wake up. Yet, even when we have found our 'why', our daily motive, we still face prejudice from our communities.\u00a0\u00a0In Singapore, where practicality and logic are prized, it seems that\u00a0high-paying jobs that work you to the bone and a job that you 30% love is the 'right thing' to do. Time and time again, \u00a0I find that most fresh grads are uncertain and not hopeful about their future. These graduates are the future of our nation, we need to do better for them and cultivate an environment that allows us to play, fail, and most importantly, aspire to be our best selves.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/34189580f701a8aa40852d3264d372c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Doodle People"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
