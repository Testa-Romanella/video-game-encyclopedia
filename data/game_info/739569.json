The game is a side-scrolling RPG, where chains are used to make up battle commands.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T06:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70aa6236ac6bf1e5829470f444981ca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
