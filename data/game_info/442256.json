In this game, the player will take on the role of a new intern at a small indie studio. Through the exploration of the office and interaction with the employees, the player will get a feel for some of the interpersonal relationships that exist in the space.<br/><br/>For this project I wanted to use visual storytelling techniques, along with short interactions, to provide characters with depth, personality, and substance. I\u00a0want the player to explore the area visually, to get a feel for each character. There are plenty of playful little moments built in to the environment, including flavor text.<br/><br/>Along the way, the player will also get a sense of what it's like to work in a small indie studio, where each person has to take on multiple roles and use a variety of skill sets to create a game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d1a7bbf4e2a49323c0c5417770abd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zen of Thieves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
