Whatever it was, it left a mess. The horrors of the blasted wasteland, the things that roam outside of city walls, the static that buzzes in your ear like an old TV... not to mention the violent fuckers out there who'd rather they have what you've got.</p>\n<p>But a job with a caravan travelling across the wastes means you can finally start a new life in the neon-lit utopia of Signal Hill. That is, until you're ambushed outside the city, your cargo stolen and your guards dead. The bright lights and the ever-present hum of the radio are starting to feel like more of a nightmare than a dream...</p>\n\n<p>Signal Hill is a post apocalyptic interactive fiction RPG set in on off-kilter world brimming with personality. Heavily inspired by Apocalypse World, Fallout: New Vegas, and Disco Elysium, it places the player into a rich text-based open world full of people to meet, things to do, and leads to follow. Authored, choice-based quests will guide you along a non-linear story as you decide who to stick with and who you're going to be.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE APOCALYPSE\r\nMAKE YOUR PLACE\r\nPLAY WITH IDENTITY\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Roam the richly detailed world of Signal Hill, learning about the place you are and the place you come from. Each area is a snapshot of city life, from the luxury of The Heights to the poverty-stricken slums of Skid Row.</p>\n<p>Meet a colourful cast of freaks with their own agendas, all eager to use you to further them. Decide which of three factions to align yourself with and find your place in the conflict brewing at the heart of Signal Hill.</p>\n<p>Beyond just skills, explore what makes your character unique and choose their identity. Become a hedonist, worship a mysterious Northern death saint, take up arms as a mercenary. Shape your past and future.</p>\n\n<p>This is a <strong><em>demo</em></strong>, meaning it's a representative portion of the final game at only about 83,000 words. Things will change, some of them a lot. The world will gain more nooks and crannies to explore, you'll be able to follow every lead down long and winding paths, and you'll gain access to even more abilities and items. The game will be receiving constant support and frequent updates for the foreseeable future.
