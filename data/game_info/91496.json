{"id": 91496, "slug": "kentucky-route-zero-itch", "name": "Kentucky Route Zero (itch)", "name_original": "Kentucky Route Zero (itch)", "description": "<p>Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it. Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill. <br/></p>\n<p>The game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt), and features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns &amp; bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. </p>\n<p>Your download includes four of five acts. Act V will be released soon.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<p>Limits &amp; Demonstrations</p>\n<p>The Entertainment</p>\n<p>Here And There Along The Echo</p>\n\n<p>Visit us at: kentuckyroutezero.com or cardboardcomputer.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e92/e92bc4e2d1c3618e81783d25891eac6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["cardboardcomputer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
