I didn't start until mid-morning on Sunday and I finished it up on Monday so it's a Jam entry, but I otherwise followed all of the Compo rules, for whatever that's worth. <br/></p>\n<p>My day job has been keeping me too busy of late so I've become kinda rusty, but it was good to get back into creative work for a change.
