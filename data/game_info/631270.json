But Ptolomy remains more powerful and influential.</p>\n<p> The powerful Roman Republic could prove to be a powerful ally to a young queen. Consul Julius Caesar has ordered the egyptian armies to stand down, but Ptolomy has not obeyed the orders. This, together with the consul's reputation for falling for royal women, could bring Cleopatra the opportunity she desperately needs to become the sole ruler of Egypt...</p>\n<p>Perhaps with some divine intervention from the goddess Isis, Cleopatra could achieve all of her goals!</p>\r\n Gameplay:\r\n<p>A stealth game played in the style of ancient egyptian stone carvings. Make sure to avoid detection by the guards while you infiltrate Caesar's room and the Temple of Isis! Use carpets to hide (based on the legend of Cleopatra entering Caesar's room hidden in a carpet)</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys/WASD: Move Left/Right.</li><li> Arrow key Up/W: Jump.</li><li> E: Enter/Leave carpet.</li><li> R: Restart level from last checkpoint.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>A VERY late entry into the\u00a0Historically Accurate Game Jam 4 (theme: mythology).
