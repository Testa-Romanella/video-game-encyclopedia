Lovecraft's very first published short story\u00a0<em>The Beast in the Cave</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>The actual text of the original story was used wherever possible. My own additions were made to fit within both the story structure and literary\u00a0style set by Lovecraft. By making the right choices, you can essentially experience the original story word for word or you can take a different path and see how else the story might have played out. There are five possible endings.</p>\n<p>Best played with headphones!</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>Low Force - Daniel Birch<br/>Plague - Kai Engel<br/><br/><strong>Sound effects</strong><br/>Sharpen Knife - J Bravo<br/>Typewriter - tamskp<br/>Help - vanceparley<br/>Crumbling- Mike Koenig<br/>Zombie Talking - Mike Koenig<br/>Breathing - Mike Koenig<br/>Inhaling Loudly - Mike Koenig</p>\n<p><strong>Engine</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created using\u00a0Twine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1423712477cd42185eeeda04b435b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jeremy Whitson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
