These people can be eaten to increase health and mana (and may also drop an item!).<br/></p>\n<p>People will run at the very sight of you, and the police will quickly run and try to beat you to death.  Pressing the Transform key will change you to Human form and will stop you from being detected!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dead of Night</strong></em> also uses a day/night cycle (of sorts!).  As Vlad is a vampire, he can only stay out at night, and as such must either retreat to his castle or find some other way to evade the sun.</p>\n<p>The Demo is a BETA version. \u00a0A lot has been reworked in the final version but the demo will give you an idea of what the game is about. \u00a0Feel free to download and try it out!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p><strong><em>- Two Game modes - Arcade (Eat-Em-Up) and Story Mode</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>- Two Story Mode Quests - with their own items, characters and settings</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>- Over 165 Uniquie Rooms to Explore</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>- Original Soundtrack and Sound Effects</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>- Original Commodore 64 Inspired Graphics</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>- Original Story and Script</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions?
