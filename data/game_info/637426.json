Game mechanics<br/>In a dream, through the power of the dream, fire increases with wakefulness, but also decreases with drowsiness.<br/>When you're fully awake, you fire at full speed.If hit by a barrage, you will consume a lot of wakefulness and save yourself.<br/>Use part of the state value to open the boundary of the dream.At the border.If it is not shot during this time, it returns a portion of its cost and rewards it with a large number of points and eliminates ammo, and if it is hit, it triggers anti-ammo prematurely.<h3> The author's words </h3>The game is more for STG beginners, so if there is enough planning, the resources can be much more.While barrage is more powerful and difficult than most N's and H's, it's enough to break these epic runes if you understand and use the binding mechanism of anti-ammo, anti-ammo, and fire coverage perfectly.Hopefully it will give you some confidence and a sense of accomplishment as you get through very difficult levels and games.<br/>In addition, the difficulty level was not developed due to the size of the game.I'm sorry,", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T02:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c85e2093a5f24cf417795acde7c52a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4e1c\u65b9\u6709\u9876\u5929\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crestruction"], "esrb_rating": null}
