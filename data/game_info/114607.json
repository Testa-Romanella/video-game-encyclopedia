The game tells a short and sad story about the last two robots on the Moon, Nebra and Albedo. It was made in less than 24 hours by AmazingHoffman. Thanks to NomNomNami (https://nomnomnami.itch.io) for her unbelievably cute game \"her tears were my light\". It inspired me greatly.</p><p>Links:<br/>In Solitudine Pax: https://insolitudinepax.itch.io<br/>Overview: https://insolitudinepax.itch.io/overview </p><p>Social Media:<br/>Like Steps in the Snow: https://twitter.com/StepsInThSnowVN<br/>In Solitudine Pax: https://twitter.com/InSolitudinePax<br/>Overview: https://twitter.com/OverviewVN<br/>AmazingHoffman: https://twitter.com/AmazingHoffman</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e6314ad1f83f49be95f9c5c6dbbbbe26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["In Solitudine Pax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
