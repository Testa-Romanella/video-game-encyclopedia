Featuring leap motion controls for the player paddle, it is a 3D pong game inspired by the flash game curveball. Instead of levels, the player is given 10 lives, and when the ball hits their wall they lose a life. When you score, the ball and AI paddle speed up incrementally. Simply use one finger to control the paddle on screen. Spin the ball to curve it!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/9650aae6a87836f6a3881c9e9beedc99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kainazzzo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
