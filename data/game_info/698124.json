(WHATTT?)</p>\n<p>You're a delivery person on a hot day where everyone wants bubble tea. There's a surge of orders and limited supply. Everyone is frustrated (who wouldn't be if you don't get your bubble tea on time, am I right?). Go around and find your customers, and shoot off anyone who tries to get bubble tea off you. Shoot them with some boba of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ever since Covid started, delivery workers have been heavily relied on, and not always treated the best. We created this game as a way of appreciating their hard work, while also empathizing with the ever increasing bubble tea craving we all have.</p>\n<p>Game/Level Design: Grace Chua, Hans</p>\n<p>Programming: Jing Lin, Shreyas Parbat</p>\n<p>Art: CS<br/></p>\n<p>Music/Sound:\u00a0Avik Chari</p>\n<p>UI: Min,\u00a0Avik</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c18ea944da6fa5b85487c715c9690e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["avikchari", "Grace Chua", "aqcd"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
