{"id": 746485, "slug": "imagamation", "name": "Imagamation", "name_original": "Imagamation", "description": "<p>This is a game for <strong>Brackey's Game Jam 2022.1</strong>. The given theme was <strong>\"It Is Not Real\".</strong> To fit the theme, I made a 3d platformer called <strong><em>Imagamation</em></strong>. The idea of the game is to click on one of the three UI elements and different platforms spawn in front of you. The green platform increases jump height, the blue platform increases speed, and the red platform is called a magnetic platform, it will follow you around and try to save you from falling when you spawn it. Do be paying attention though; there is a random chance for obstacles to spawn. The goal of the game is to get as far and high as possible in a random amount of seconds.</p>\n<p>While the game is not visually appealing, it is my very first completed game, therefore modelling was not part of my priorities.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T07:12:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9a92b140f31fff3784f3c1cd07129de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sasyimmagoat"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
