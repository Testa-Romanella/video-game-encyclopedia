It was directed and produced by Toru Hagihara, with Koji Igarashi acting as assistant director. It is the direct sequel to Castlevania: Rondo of Blood taking place four years later. It features Dracula&#39;s dhampir son Alucard as the protagonist rising from his slumber to explore the Dracula&#39;s castle which has re-appeared after Richter Belmont has vanished. It marks a break from previous games in the series, introducing exploration, non-linear level design and role-playing elements.<br />\nInitially, the game was unsuccessful\u00a0\u2013 particularly in the United States where it was meagerly publicized\u00a0\u2013 but thanks to praise by critics, it gained sales through word-of-mouth and became a hit. It has been re-released on several consoles and is considered a sleeper hit, a cult classic, and one of the best video games ever made.</p>", "metacritic": 93, "released": "1997-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T23:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/45d/45da4dc311d84b79230317d7b24a3dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.36, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 124, "owned": 868, "beaten": 400, "toplay": 153, "dropped": 103, "playing": 30}, "playtime": 19, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 531, "suggestions_count": 1144, "game_series_count": 30, "reviews_count": 540, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation", "Android", "Xbox 360", "iOS"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Konami Digital Entertainment", "Digital Eclipse"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
