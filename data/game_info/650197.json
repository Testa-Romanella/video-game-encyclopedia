The asteroids are attracted to each other by an accurate, if exaggerated, representation of gravitational forces as laid forth by Newton. The law of conservation of momentum is also at play in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:15:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b132f21871bd659b157155e8fa25083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["steenish"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
