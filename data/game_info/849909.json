The goal of the game is to keep a particle in circular motion for as long as possible. Your particle starts moving slowly, but gets faster as the game progresses.</p>\n\n<p>When your particle enters a positive (red) gate, press 'F' to begin rotating clockwise.</p>\n\n<p>When your particle enters a negative (blue) gate, press 'J' to begin rotating counter-clockwise.</p>\n\n<p>If a gate spawns and the particle is too close, a ghost will appear until the particle is out of range. Failure to press the correct button before leaving a gate will result in a game over.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T08:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f7/7f70d2a24cd8466b5bf94ff6690da0fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Yokamaa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
