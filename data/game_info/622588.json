We designed this game to understand and explain what it is like to look at life through the eyes of a cargo worker(owner or worker its up to you).<br/>You can grapple with all sorts of ordeals on a deserted mountain road and make your bread with your sweat, or you can manage a shipping company in the city and swim in money in the monopoly you set up with your friends.<br/>Logistics Simulator promises you good times to spend with your friends. When you buy this game, you buy not a game but a fun time to spend with your friends. Is it the sense of accomplishment of working together? Or is it the pleasure of taking a job behind your friends and pocketing the extra money? If you want to experience both, Logistics Simulator is for you.<br/>Logistics Simulator is being prepared by a young developer. The problems will be resolved as soon as possible.
