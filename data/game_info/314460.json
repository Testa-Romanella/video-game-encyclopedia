All of the code and art was made from scratch within Unity. Sorry for the broken/wonky/vague features and controls, I just ran out of time :)</p>\n<p>The game contained a game-breaking bug, so I\u00a0had to fix it post-jam. <br/><br/>*If anyone care about the error*<br/>Something with Unity's tilesets crashed it on scene load. So after some fiddling around I got it working by seperating all tilessets to their own grid. Thanks Unity.</p>\n<p>LD Page:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/the-summoners-siege/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T06:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3c/e3c43f98b0f199f39a29b0932ec96ff3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TwinGhosts"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
