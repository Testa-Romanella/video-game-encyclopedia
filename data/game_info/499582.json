Dark Side of the Earth gives you this opportunity. Visualize the Sun\u2019s radiant warmth casting across our planet, bisecting the world into day and night.</p>\n<p>Start by experiencing those perfect 24 hours of equinox, when the Earth\u2019s tilt is aligned so that everywhere on the planet experiences exactly 12 hours of day and night. Or watch the solstice, when perpetual darkness bathes polar regions in one hemisphere, while the other experiences perpetual day. Zoom through time to watch the seasonal cycle of sunlight animate as the Earth orbits around the Sun.</p>\n<p>Everything in the app is based on real scientific data: complex geometric calculations are performed to give the correct diurnal and seasonal cycle of sunlight throughout the year.
