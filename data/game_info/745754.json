The more he tries to find them, the more things seem to spin out of control. The tone is funny but also kind of introspective, following the kind of crappy morning that makes you rethink every decision you\u2019ve ever made while wandering around in your underwear.</p>\n<p>This is a very short game!</p>\n<p>Solve retro style point-and-click puzzles on your quest to get out of the house.<br />\nIntricate, detailed pixel art brings a rainy workday morning to life.</p>\n<p>Offbeat humour and a touching emotional journey. Will he find his pants? There\u2019s only one way to find out!</p>\n<p>And always remember- you are more than the sum of your pants.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T04:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/41513486850251ad18855ff9e7715c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghost Cat Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ghost Cat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
