It's short dark and a story I've been meaning to tell for a while so I hope you enjoy it. There's not much to talk about since it's so short and not that special.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Developer note:</em></strong></p>\n<p>This little project is my first attempt at game making. It was done in 2 weeks and was definitely an interesting experience. The game is not extremely polished and never will be. Making games is not my passion or something very high on my priorities list so don't expect another project from me.\u00a0 I am very open to criticism (even though I am already aware of most problems with the game) so feel free to leave a comment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's all. Now go play the game pls...</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8dae534688a0016f8dc71c20cbef9c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mr.P1nk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
