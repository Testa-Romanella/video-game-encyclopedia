We wanted to put this proof of concept\u00a0out there for people to play and give us their feedback.</p>\n<p>The game is very simple: you need to control a resupply spacecraft and perform a successful docking to the space station. The spacecraft can be rotated and translated across 3 axis, so you'll need to use 12 keys! There's also a key for killing the velocity across all axis, but it consumes a significant amount of fuel!</p>\n<p>We'd really appreciate if you can take the time to complete a survey after playing the game and let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>Follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and check out our\u00a0development blog\u00a0in order to stay up to date with the latest news.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f86f65c93a1bc83eebd6cd2a24d55c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Polar Motion", "msanjurj"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
