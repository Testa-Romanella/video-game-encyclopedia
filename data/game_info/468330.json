{"id": 468330, "slug": "drone-around-the-world", "name": "Drone Around the World", "name_original": "Drone Around the World", "description": "<p> - This game was cobbled together in a few hours for the \"DC Jam Summer 2020\". The theme was \"Going Global\" so in this game you'll pilot a drone across the world. The further from home you travel, the more points you get for collecting rings. But flying this drone is <em>really</em> hard, so best of luck to you!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> - Designed for Xbox-compatible twin-stick controls, or WASD, use the left control to change Thrust and Yaw. Use the Right control to change Pitch and Roll. Be delicate, and don't let the drone crash.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Get one point for every Ring you fly through, multiplied by your Bonus. The Bonus increases the further from start you are, so <strong>be bold, and GO GLOBAL!<br/></strong></p><p>*NOTE* For DC Jam judging, I submitted the last build with the addition of the theme song late. Everything else was submitted on time. I also started at 2am though, so if you want to give me some leeway since everything was done within, 21 hrs, it's up to you. If you judge my audio without the song... I might actually do better :P<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:35:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbdcc9a545077f177159c3019e197a08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["callenshaw"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
