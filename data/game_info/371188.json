The maps are bare and the inventory system doesn't work, but it's a fun little game to play.</p><p>If enough people demand it, I'll take the project further. But for now, it's just a submission for CGJ2019 and my best shot at getting the best game soundtrack award.<br/><br/>Make sure to check me out on Youtube and subscribe to make sure you are notified when I upload the high quality versions of these soundtracks.<br/></p><p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQWN7zdUfskROpOVrkR2TYg?view_as=subscriber<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:43:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d74e515c38bbc1f637d9676252dc537a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDSherbert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
