It was ported to the Apple II and Commodore 64.</p>\n<p>Wayout is among the first maze games to offer full 360 degree 3D perspective and movement, and its graphics were considered state-of-the-art upon its release. There were many pseudo-3D maze games at the time (such as 3D Monster Maze, Phantom Slayer, and 3-Demon), but they used a fixed perspective and only 4-way movement.</p>\n<p>Capture the Flag was released as a follow-up in 1983. It has similar graphics to Wayout, but allows two players to compete at once with a split-screen view, and adds dynamic music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efee62b4b18de9e2fd0c4845fd467362.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit"], "developers": ["Sirius Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sirius Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
