One thing interesting about this game is that it's <strong><em>extremely difficult</em></strong> but I designed some bugs for you to use. Don't be upset if you can't pass, I have to try several times to pass even the second level!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you are interested in the development of this game and my further study of game developing please follow me on <strong>Instagram</strong>(https://www.instagram.com/illuminat_or/)/@illuminat_or.
