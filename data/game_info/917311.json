Dongeng Bayang Kulit is a <strong>turn-based RPG</strong> that is loosely based on <strong>Southeast Asian folklore</strong>. You play as the recently ship-less,\u00a0<strong><em>Captain N'man</em></strong> and his mystical guide, <strong><em>Putri Matami</em></strong> as they travel in search for answers regarding a <strong>mysterious\u00a0apparition</strong> that has taken to incessantly haunting N'man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo covers the <strong>first chapter</strong> of the game (a little over an hour gameplay wise) where the unlikely duo are investigating their first lead: a <strong>foreboding presence</strong> somewhere deep in the heart of\u00a0the long-abandoned <strong><em>Old Water Village</em></strong>. Will the party be able to locate the ominous presence? What will they find? Will it be enough to free N'man? You'll have to play to find out!\u00a0We hope you have a great experience with it!
