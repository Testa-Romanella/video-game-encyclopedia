By the way, you are a <strong>cat</strong>. On <strong>roller skates</strong>. So good luck!</p>\n\n<p>You can jump and gain speed by moving your paws. Take care though - if you hit an object while moving too fast, you will lose a part of your health. If you lose all your health, you will have to start all over.</p>\n\n<p>While moving at your own pace, you will be approached by some human through the power of text messaging. This will initiate a <strong>dialogue</strong> - and who knows what that can lead to? Reply to this human by choosing an appropriate answer. Some answers will regain your health, while others can lead to a <strong>unique ending</strong>.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>A or D - acceleration. To achieve higher speed, use different keys, and not the same one in a row.</p>\n<p>A <strong>and</strong> D - stop. This will help you lessen the chance of colliding with things.</p>\n<p>Space - jump.</p>\n<p>LMB - select an option in the dialogue.</p>\n<p>Health loss can happen only when you collide with objects while moving <strong>too fast</strong> (the high speed is indicated by green particles). Remember, that you can regain some health if you choose certain options in the dialogue. </p>\r\nEnding:\r\n<p>The game has 2 endings (3 endings if you count the health loss ending). Achieving the non-default ending may require you playing around with different dialogue options and hearing how the game reacts to them.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435 Ludum Dare 47 \u043e\u0442 \u0421\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u201c\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440</em><em>\".<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The game was developed during Ludum Dare 47, authors community \"Indicator\" edition.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b201723a802fdbc221fcb634f4386db5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sunnray"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
