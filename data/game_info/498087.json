But you may have the power to stop it.<br/></p>\n<p>Dodge Walls and Obstacles long enough to reach the Key at the end of each World. Collect all 4 to complete your mission.<br/></p>\n<p>You have the ability to slip between parallel worlds at any time. The terrain remains the same. But you will have escaped from the increased difficulty of certain obstacles.<br/></p>\n<p>Collect Fruit to refill health.</p>\n<p>I made some last minute adjustments. But the game Should be beatable. I'm like73% sure.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Jump with the SPACE key, Jump again for Double Jump.</p>\n<p>Left and Right movement with (A and D) OR (LEFT and RIGHT) arrow keys</p>\n<p>World Shift with the W or UP arrow Key<br/></p>\n<p>I noticed the \"Effect\" representing your invincibility frames doesn't look correct on the broswer version.
