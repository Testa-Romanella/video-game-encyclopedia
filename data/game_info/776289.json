Axolotl is Dry is a precision platforming game where your goal is to guide a small axolotl that was taken by an eagle to a place far away from his lake. Navigate spike walls, bouncy palm trees, intradimensional portals and much more. Help the axolotl get to his home!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Your journey back home will be filled with harsh challenges. Utilize your diverse abilities - jumps, dashes, wall slides and more - to navigate various types of obstacles. Avoid spikes, swerve sharp blades, jump in coconuts and recover your dash in magical crystals to get to your destination.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the heat of the desert, every second counts. The little axolotl needs water lest he sweats himself completely dry. You'll need to move fast and continuously to be able to win.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Phew, how refreshing!
