Since this is a one button game, the character will automatically walk and turn around, but everything else is up to you. Throughout the game you will collect an inventory of different items to assist you. The challenge of the game is figuring what item to use in each scenario quickly enough before you fall into a bed of spikes, get eaten by a giant bat or drop into a pit of no return. As the game progresses, the obstacles will become more difficult and you'll have more items at your disposal so figuring out the correct one to use will be more and more difficult.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82c9cd3cd7703cf3a0a3d5259f19fbf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jarow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
