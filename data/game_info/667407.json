Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>As for the future gameplay style, I have two proposed options.</p>\n<p>1. Level-based \"puzzle\" style where you use the limited boxes provided to complete the objective</p>\n<p>2. A survival based sandbox where you build your ship to defend an upgradable base. Possibly enemy AI bases that need to be destroyed to win, or simple wave based survival.</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy to take suggestions as well!</p><p>Twitter<br/></p><p>Discord<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25edb4fbf1d6da66f8f58ec8d2c46395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheMadChemist"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
