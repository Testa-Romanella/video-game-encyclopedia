A messy bed beckons him to give up, and an empty inbox insists that no one cares about him. Everywhere he looks, the world shows him what he lacks.<br/><br/>Until one day, he forgets to shut his window and lets a little bird into his life.<br/><br/>As the player, you play through three very different days of Tom's life, exploring his neighborhood and interpreting his thoughts through word puzzles. As his perception changes, his worldview widens, allowing Tom to see the unexplored, hidden dimensions of his life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/126/1265c450df83e7533118147198a51a2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Frostwood Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
