It is a very simple game: click until you can click no more. That is approx. 32,000 clicks. If you're really bored and want to skip to the end, hold X and click.</p>\n<p>That's it! I had fun making the number sprites and especially the cursor sprites. Just threw this together in an hour because it's been a very scattered month as usual.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM August 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a14bc0daf957ca4ce65e7d9468961294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
