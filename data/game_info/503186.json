Let's go with that sure. Made during Ludum Dare 47 by the same duo that created Second Layer</p>\n\n<p>WASD to move, mouse to aim and mouse buttons to swing weapon. You can sprint with Shift. Esc to quit the game.</p>\n<p>You can talk with the NPC's by aiming and swinging your sword at them. It's fine, you brought your smart sword and it wont harm anyone friendly. In fact it makes them talk!</p>\n\n<p>Can you fight yourself trough the many perils and reach the dreaded ENDGAME CONTENT???<br/></p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to our co-conspirators Adecristo and Vatix for ensuring we have higher-than-usual quality 3D and 2D assets with the game (and others who submitted their take on what house looks like but we ran out of time to implement them).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/25395ccf610ee4d8460c872788423a1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Naamed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
