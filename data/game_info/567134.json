The goal is to stop the enemies from getting past the bottom of the map. Your towers will degrade over time so you can't just set up some towers and then go eat lunch, you will need to replace the destroyed towers if you hope to survive. This game is only in a prototype stage so please do not expect a fully polished game.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>W</strong> or <strong>S</strong> to move forward and back</li><li><strong>A</strong> or <strong>D</strong> to rotate left and right</li><li><strong>Spacebar</strong> to spawn a tower in front of you</li><li><strong>R</strong> to reset your rotation</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e664dd8f2bdce883e9b5c7d0a404b6c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nicholas Alesse"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
