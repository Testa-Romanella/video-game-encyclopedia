The minions gather in a queue behind you as you pick them up, and you can only use the minion at the front of the queue at a time. They will protect you as they follow you, so they resemble your in-game lives. You must sacrifice them to progress, but if you take damage without any following you, it\u2019s game over!</p>\n<p>This was our first Ludum Dare, and while we didn\u2019t participate in the solo competition, we did finish in 48 hours with one playable sample level, with four different types of minions (fire, water, bomb, normal), obstacles, and a queue structure used to have them follow you. A full game would include levels that test the user on picking up the right minions, in the right order, and using them to navigate different obstacles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faf580a924624caf9bf126322e9709b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axelancer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
