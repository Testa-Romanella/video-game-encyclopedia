The ratio between the angular velocities of these two planets, is what makes them trace out a beautiful symmetrical flower pattern as they orbit the Sun.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Planet Dance allows you to create multiple planets orbiting at different angular velocities, configure their orbits and customize their trails to get fantastic looking results.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:34:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd6d9b2906a7297abe9e47896929fb89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["laverzatti"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
