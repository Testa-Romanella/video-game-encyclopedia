Look at the artefacts you find around them to identify what they were used for, then label them on your map. Once you draw all of the buildings in the correct location and put the right\u00a0labels on\u00a0them, you win :)</p>\n<p>Be careful while you dig! A direct hit with most tools will smash any artefacts in the way. Your tools also wear out after a lot of use, so make sure to visit the camp now and then to repair them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a365403965fc41d3c3b2ea41a3e68056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chel"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
