{"id": 960490, "slug": "slime-knight-2", "name": "Slime Knight", "name_original": "Slime Knight", "description": "You are a humble slime that has recently found refuge for you and your family in a small village.  Everything seemed peaceful...until a gigantic wurm, thought to be a myth, emerges from the deep underground and devours the entire civilization in one enormous gulp!<br/><br/>Separated from your family, you awaken inside the beast's maw, and discover the corpse of a knight wearing a suit of armor.  After imbuing the corpse with your slimy essence, you are able to deftly maneuver around the hostile creatures that lurk around you, as well as fight back with your stretchy, toxic appendages!<br/><br/>Your family must be deeper inside the belly of this beast.  Will you be able to fight your way through and rescue them before it's too late?<h3>Take Control of Slime Knight!</h3>The slightest touch of your gooey essence will damage almost anything it touches.  Use this to your advantage and take enemies by surprise by stretching your arm out, and whipping it in their direction!<br/><br/><h3>Swing, Punch, Grab, Throw, Survive!</h3>Your extendable arm is deceptively simple, but offers you a bevy of tools to handle a variety of situations.  <br/><br/><br/>Swing your arm through hordes of enemies to damage them en masse.  Punch creatures out of your way with your first.  Or, grab them and throw them at their allies to really stir some chaos!<br/><br/>Use it to its full extent to tackle any challenge that comes your way!<h3>Devour the Devoured</h3>As a slime, you have one more trick up your sleeve that could turn the tides of battle.  <br/><br/><br/>If you deal enough damage to an enemy while it is clutched in your gooey fist, you can finish them off by devouring them completely.  Doing so will grant you unique abilities that could help get you out of a desparate situation.<br/><br/>Different enemies grant different abilities when devoured, so be sure to experiment and plan your targets strategically!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T03:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b61f528432ebf55a0448fbd74706aa.jpg", "website": "https://beastbellystudios.wixsite.com/beast-belly-studios", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jared Slawski", "andrew taylor johnson", "Ogulcan Buyuksandalyaci", "Sage Severson", "Jonathan Conger", "Isaac Houston", "Wanqing Hu", "MyKaela Parag", "Zeshi Chen", "Chandler Jeffcoat", "Ivan Lee", "Mitchell Walker", "Stephen Holdmeyer", "Lucas Qu", "Kayle Heideman", "Tim Trimble", "Jeremy Van Patten"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Beast Belly Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
