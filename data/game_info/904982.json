Here are a few of the changes:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0NPC and animal character models introduced (imported via Unity Asset Store). Added scripting for each of them to animate them properly.</li><li>NPC waves to the player (if it thinks it needs to catch the player's attention), and always turns towards the player. When the player approaches the NPC and presses \"T\", NPC talks. The dialog shown is also a new change, and the dialog content changes depending on the player's progress.</li><li>The animals have favorite food types, and if their favorite food type is given to them and they are hungry, they walk towards the food and if they are the first to reach, they eat it. If there is no food or they are not hungry, they randomly move and make sounds.</li><li>Gun logic has been changed to be able to throw food projectiles after player picks them up.</li><li>New Copyright-free music downloaded and added to the game. The music is context sensitive. Once the player is in a dangerous situation, action music starts playing, after things calm down, calmer music continues in a few seconds.</li><li>Lots of environment assets and terrain assets have been added via Unity Asset Store. The levels are enriched with those assets.</li><li>When the player beats the game, congratulations message is shown, and the camera rotates, just like in the intro.</li><li>Intro scene has been changed to reflect the spirit of the Happy Valley.</li></ol>\n<p>Submission by M.Y.
