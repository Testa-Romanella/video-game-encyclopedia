This was an experimental project in order to allow me to have something in my portfolio before I start working on bigger projects.\u00a0 Please keep in mind I am only 14, and do not have the resources to get a job! Any amount of money spent towards this game helps me tremendously in my future as an indie developer!</p>\n\r\ndescription\r\n<p>\"no going back\" is an all-ages, side-scroller in which you can only go forward. The main character, Axle, embarks on an adventure while encountering mobs such as slimes, all the while trying to overcome a greater enemy.\u00a0 Find your sisters, switch characters, and gain xp throughout the game in order to build and enhance the experience.</p>\n\r\nstory\r\n<p>\"no going back\" is a short but sweet indie side-scroller that takes place in the fictional Lukra Forest. Lukra Forest\u2014the home of our three main characters, Axle, Kat, and Lucy\u2014was invaded by dangerous mobs. As a result, the Lords of the Land placed a curse on it: anyone who stepped foot in the forest could not leave without bringing with them the souls of the three residents. One day, Axle came home to find that her two sisters were missing, presumably kidnapped by someone trapped in the forest. Axle knew she had to find them and bring them somewhere safe.\u00a0Yet, it was clear now that Lukra was not a safe place\u2014once they left, there was no going back.</p>\n\r\ngameplay\r\n<p>This game features simple controls, understandable and usable by all ages. Overall, the gameplay is simple, the hardest factor being that you cannot go back, figuratively and literally. All in all, this game is simple, but still a unique experience that any avid gamer should try.</p>\n<br/>\r\ncontrols\r\n<ul><li>Right arrow key to move</li><li>X, K, and L keys to switch between Axle, Kat, and Lucy, once you have unlocked them</li><li>I to check inventory</li><li>Numbers to use inventory items (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0); these increase hp; Axle (blue witch) can only pick up and eat blueberries, Kat (red witch) can only pick up and eat cherries, and Lucy (green witch) can only pick up and eat apples</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Click to attack</li></ul>\n\r\ndevelopment\r\n<p>The devlopment of this game was fun and full of challenges.\u00a0This was my very first \"full\" game ever, and I was entirely new to 2D game development\u00a0and coding.\u00a0I challenged myself to create the game entirely alone, utilising both pre-existing assets and my own skills in areas such as music and storywriting. This allowed me to have complete creative control over the game, although it was much more time-hefty to complete.</p>\n\r\nplans for future development\r\n<ul><li>Make sprites less buggy</li><li>Better save feature</li><li>More in-depth OST</li><li>Longer/more difficult gameplay</li><li>More interaction</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nplans for future games\r\n<ul><li>Bastion's Reign, a 3D choose-your-own-adventure RPG</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T10:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f82/f82a044b4fb4ee8cb8e2184ed3b5a1f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laktoz AJ"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
