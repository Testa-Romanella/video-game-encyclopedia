It was released for the Amiga in February 1993. The player control a bipedal mech and are tasked with killing advancing enemies in stages set in multiple time periods. Development of the game began after the release of Blood Money, but was scrapped in 1990 because the game was not coming together. By the end of the year, development had recommenced with a redesign, inspired by sprites originally intended for Blood Money. Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy designed the game, and Raymond Usher wrote its soundtrack. The game was released to positive reviews with praise directed at the game's graphics and sound, but reviewers were critical towards the repetitiveness of the gameplay. Amiga Power ranked it among their top 100 Amiga games of 1993.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9dcb72d1e848833e8d01812942ccb94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Rockstar North", "DMA Design"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis", "SCE Studio Liverpool"], "esrb_rating": null}
