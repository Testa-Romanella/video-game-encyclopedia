Monster rooms need all monsters cleared before you can move on to the next room. Gauntlet rooms require you to simply get to the end of the room and avoid all the traps. Puzzle rooms require switches to be activated in order to open the exit door. Sacrifice rooms require you to make a moral decision before you can progress to the next room.</p>\n<p>When you die, you can be resurrected. You will have sacrifice your stats when doing so (Max HP, Attack, Defence, Attack Speed, Move Speed). If you help Lucifer, he will reward you by improving your stats - though your decisions will impact your final test at the end of the dungeon.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>[MOUSE VERSION]</p>\n<p>- W, A, S, D (or arrow keys) - *Movement*\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- Left-Click - *Attack*\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- Space - *Interact, Hold to Drag / Push Objects*\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- Left-Shift (or right click) - *Dash*\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>[KEYBOARD ONLY VERSION]</p>\n<p>- W, A, S, D (or arrow keys) to move\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- J - Attack\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- K - Interact\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- L - Dash\u00a0\u00a0<br/>- Space - Drag / Push Objects\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You play Vincent, a rabbit who\u2019s poorly son has just died. When burying his son, Lucifer appears and offers Vincent a way to bring his son back to life. Vincent is taken to Lucifers dungeon, and told he must prove how much he wants his son back through fighting his way through the dungeon. During this trial, Vincent can gain help from Lucifer: reviving yourself when dead, helping you clear / solve a dungeon room, providing you with improved character stats. However, all of these come at a cost: losing character stats, making immoral decisions, making the end boss fight more difficult. Vincent must make it to Lucifer at the end of the dungeon, in order to bring back his little baby rabbit son. </p>\n\n<p><strong>F.A.Q</strong><br/>**The game is too hard!**<br/>It is difficult, but you can be revived as often as you like other than on the final boss.</p>\n<p>**The aiming is too difficult**<br/>Yes, it is. We wanted an old school approach, but in hindsight it will frustrate more people than we'd like.</p>\n<p>**There's a bug with... **<br/>Please let us know with as much detail as possible &lt;3 thank you!\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d321479ed88b678d388ca296e4945451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
