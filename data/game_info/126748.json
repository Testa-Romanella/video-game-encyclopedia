The lifeless bodies the Boxes leave behind are said to bring children everywhere happiness. There are many \"Toys\" who reject that idea and will survive, defiantly, until their last breaths.</em>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Boxed by Christmas</em> is a game about survival. Inspired by the gameplay in the asymmetrical multiplayer game <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Boxed by Christmas</em> brings to life a spin on the characteristics of Santa Claus. <em>Boxed by Christmas</em> was created in just under 24 hours, including the completion of code, art and sound assets. It was developed as part of an ongoing \"Let's Dev\" series on YouTube, which documents the trials &amp; tribulations of learning to make video games.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t\tWatch <em>Boxed by Christmas</em> being made on YouTube: \r\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOZiUKLr92kGcLh-ItvEGjOdxAIdnNbRs\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis game is completely free to play.
