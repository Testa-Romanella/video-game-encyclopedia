Shapes can only be joined with shapes of the same color and/or polygon. Make sure that each shape can reach every other shape to beat the level and lines can't cross!</p>\n<p>Also, if a shape has a number in it, it must have that many direct connections!</p>\n\n<p><em>Connect them all!</em> is a game made in under 48 hours for GMTKJam2021 (theme: Joined Together). I had a great time honing in on a design given the theme and time constraints, as well as racking my brain over puzzle design. It's definitely tough in such a small time frame!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click Drag from one shape to another to connect</p>\n<p>Right Click on a connection to remove it</p>\n<p>(Esc to exit the application. Beware! Progress doesn't save)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Attributions\r\n</p>\n<p>- Unity 2019.4.26f1</p>\n<p>- Unity Assets: Shapes, UniTask, DOTween, ScriptableObjectArchitecture, NaughtyAttributes, better-minimal-webgl-template</p>\n<p>- icon: left click by Kirby Wu from the Noun Project\r\n</p>\n<p>- PT Serif font\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Lato font\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23b/23b6bf4663531a1d2709e07fa36859e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["sharkwithlasers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
