I'm RMF_AndyPlayz! I am a game developer and has been working on this game for over 3 years! After this 3 years of continuous coding and bug testing, I present to you \"Toewr le Fence\"<br/><br/>Note that this is my first time in my life doing this. So expect errors pretty much anywhere!<br/><br/>Here's a basic description:<br/>(I'm trying my best to explain without spoiling!)<br/>This is an endless tower defense-themed game where your objective is to survive as long as possible and get the highest score you can get (subject to change. I may add levels later!). In this game, some turrets and threats are replaced with memes (because that's kinda the current trend of gen-z humor).<br/><br/>Target age group: 10-20 years old. (This is the age range where you understand memes, but this game is for you as long as you understand and like 'em!)<br/><br/>Be aware, this is the 1st release. Which means that the game is all \"Programmer Art.\" I am looking forward to polishing up this game in the future!<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a basic rundown because I do not want to spoilers!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T03:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46f/46ffcc2ef3c30ad448a875fab4ab5354.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/toewrlefenceofficialwebsite", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RMF_AndyPlayz"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["RMF_AndyPlayz"], "esrb_rating": null}
