Help him get out using any means you see fit.<br/></p>\n\n\n\r\nOur hero? Mel doesn't quite remember what happened leading up to this, and the stockpile of strange weapons through the cave only further muddy the waters.<br/><br/>Some kind of mindless drone which appears to patrol the interior of the cave system. It's on the prowl for any intruders... or anything it thinks, or is told to think, the world would be better without.\r\n\r\nSure you could argue that this modified Uzi has a lot missing, but what it lacks in damage it makes up for in fire rate. This gun came straight from a stolen arms shipment container and wound up in the hands of an illegal weapons tinkerer.<br/><br/>Why would a cave system have energy-hogging devices like this inside? Whatever the reason, these stationary laser-firing turrets will vaporize anything that comes in contact with its beam.<br/><br/>The primitive spike, a staple of defense throughout time. Landing on one of these sure would hurt...<br/><br/>Why the hell would anyone leave land mines in an abandoned cave? Better be extra cautious around those.<br/><br/>Looks like this key could fit in a door. Quite a cliche if you ask me!<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:47:09", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Greasepile"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
