Created by an intern, Sam Pegg, and overseen by James Baker, Head of Digital Humanities. This project is designed to bring attention to the decisions that we make regarding the environment, spotlighting the small actions we make (or don't make) and the impact they have. While this project does not claim to solve or provide a \"how to end\" climate change thesis, it does seek to empower the decisions we can make that have much more significant impacts than we give them credit for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the style of a click-and-continue adventure, this short project contains both a \"short-play\" option and a \"long-play\" option. \"Short-play\" should take five minutes, while \"long-play\" takes roughly 10-15 minutes.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c7b94fc0e9f6d9ec1643e99efa7214a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["biglittleinteractive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
