But today, none of that matters. Timmy's parents are unconscious and it's Christmas morning. Time to open some presents. They're out pretty hard, so there's no reason <em>not </em>to throw the presents around to open them (Hold left button and drag to move presents). Maybe if he hits them hard enough on the walls they will open.</p>\n<p>With any luck you'll get an\u00a0<strong>unexpected</strong> gift or two.</p>\n<p>Yeah basically this whole game is built upon the \"suprise\" of what's in Timmy's presents.</p>\n<p>Artist - Jonah\u00a0Switzer</p>\n<p>Programmer - Jake Dubeau</p>\n<p>Wall art done by\u00a0www.facebook.com/theartofdanverkys</p>\n<p>Note: Sound effects and\u00a0music aren't working in this build.
