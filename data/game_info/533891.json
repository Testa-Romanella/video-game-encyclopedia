There is also an\u00a0optional objective of destroying the harmful turrets which are disrupting the local flora, but it's not fully implemented.</p>\n<p>Inspired largely by the early structures in the Blame! manga. I wanted to capture a feeling of being lost in\u00a0endlessly branching monolithic architecture. I personally find the idea\u00a0</p>\n<p>comforting somehow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll try to push out a post-jam version in a bit, to make things more user friendly but also to expand on the design. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Generation algo:</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Generate spaces.<ol><li>Place primary (vertical circulation), secondary, and noise nodes. For each subsequent floor, place some primary nodes above primaries from the lower floor (to be used as vertical circulation.)</li><li>Create connections between nodes and their closest 2-3 nodes.\u00a0Also connect relevant primary nodes.</li><li>Pathfind these connections.</li><li>Carve out small and large volumes randomly.</li></ol></li><li>Assign \"biome\" values to spaces using 3d perlin noise.</li><li>Instantiate &amp; orient architecture prefabs for all spaces, mostly based on biomes.</li><li>Instantiate enemies and props mostly randomly.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Hold right-click for grapple hook.</li><li>Left-click for gun (just for shooting turrets).</li><li>F for flashlight.</li><li>G to shoot out flares/glowsticks.</li><li>WASD movement, SPACE for jump, hold LEFT SHIFT for run.</li><li>BACKSPACE to generate new level.</li><li>ESCAPE to quit.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>It's possible to spawn in an area disconnected from the main structure.
