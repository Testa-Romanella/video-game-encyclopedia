Humanity's relentless pursuit of colonization and resource exploitation has led them to the Aegis system. This yellow star, located 129 light years from Earth, holds great potential. Within its orbit lies Hera, the fourth planet\u2014a super-jovian situated perfectly within Aegis' habitable zone.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInitial surveys revealed Typhon, a promising satellite orbiting Hera, boasting a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and liquid water. However, strange interference plagued orbital scans, limiting data collection. Multiple failed landing attempts resulted in the tragic loss of over 200 crew members. Something inexplicable awaited them on Typhon's surface\u2014severe temporal anomalies. Modern technology became useless, and Earth-based lifeforms perished within seconds.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot deterred, humanity made a breakthrough in 2390. Utilizing primitive silicon-based computers and LOX-liquid methane rocket engines, the first successful landing on Typhon's surface was achieved. Automated exploration missions commenced, but the limitations of the hardware prevented the integration of advanced artificial intelligence.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile collected flora and fauna samples decayed rapidly when taken to orbit, mineral samples proved stable. Crystal-like formations known as stasis crystals were discovered, capable of altering the flow of time within their vicinity. Overnight, these crystals became the most coveted resource in human space.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2392, unable to reproduce stasis crystals artificially, private corporations were granted mineral extraction rights by the United Terran Nations government. Repurposing the government's exploration bot template, these corporations became mining powerhouses.\n\nMissions\n\n\n<br/>\nExperience the heart of Typhon's exploration as a Pilot. Join one of the corporations and board their space station orbiting Typhon. Your mission: complete a series of daring endeavors.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore each mission, undergo a virtual reality briefing, immersing yourself in the mission area. Identify objectives, plan your approach, and customize your mech's loadout\u2014select the perfect mech type, drive, weapons, and auxiliary systems. Code your bot's every movement and action, shaping its destiny. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeploy your programmed mech to Typhon's surface, accompanied by recording drones capturing every moment. Mission windows are narrow, demanding swift completion. Failure to finish within the allotted time results in the mech's abandonment and a failed mission. But fear not, the recorded data ensures insights and analysis.\n\nEquipment\n\n<br/>\nEmbrace the power of mechs. Choose from three weight classes: light, medium, and heavy. Speed, durability, and carrying capacity vary across the classes, allowing for versatile playstyles.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTerrain dictates your mech's drive\u2014wheels, legs, treads, or the remarkable hover drive. While true flight remains elusive, the hover drive enables seamless movement a couple of meters above the ground, traversing water and overcoming obstacles. Strategize your mech loadout based on the terrain's demands.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEquip your mech with mining tools, weapons for defense against native life forms, and shields for protection. But remember, rivalry between mining corporations runs deep, and accidental skirmishes are not uncommon. Additionally, auxiliary slots offer opportunities for power sources, repair equipment, or ECM gear.\n\nTime\n \n<br/>\nDiscover the awe-inspiring influence of stasis crystals. These enigmatic entities possess the ability to manipulate time within their vicinity. Though time travel remains elusive, they can dramatically slow down or speed up time. Infrared sensors help locate these temporal anomalies, characterized by a significant drop in temperature in faster time areas.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Pilot, understanding time becomes paramount. Each second is divided into ten ticks, and your mech's actions are limited by the computing core's capacity per tick. Strive for balance and efficiency, utilizing time-altering areas to gain a tactical advantage.\n\nModding  \n<br/>\nBecome the architect of your own adventures through the powerful mission editor. Craft unique mission scenarios, set objectives, and control the placement of stasis crystals. Combine multiple missions, including solo, co-op and BvB missions, into custom campaigns. Share your creations with the community or embark on missions designed by fellow pilots.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin the ranks of the elite pilots venturing into Typhon's temporal mysteries. Engage in exhilarating battles, extract valuable resources, and unlock the secrets of a world where time is fluid. The fate of humanity's expansion lies in your hands.
