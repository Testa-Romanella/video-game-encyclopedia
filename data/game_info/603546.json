It is a 3rd person 3D very low poly game. In this game, the player will race against time and fight other delivery driving companies to deliver their food the fastest. The faster and more well persevered the food is when the player delivers it, the more tips and company respect the player will get for upgrades. These upgrades will go to their vehicle, equipment, and delivery business size. The player will start with an old car in a poverty-stricken area with a small delivery company. Eventually, the player will upgrade, have a fast race car, and complete tasks in a rich upper-class city with a team of delivery employees.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>General Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sizable World Map with Real Time Traffic</li><li>Delivery Driving Cars</li><li>Wacky Voice Acted Characters</li><li>3D Low Poly Models</li><li>Vibrant Colored Textures</li><li>Enemy Delivery Drivers</li><li>Upgrades and Player Progression</li></ul>\n<p><em>*It is recommended to play with a controller but mouse and keyboard will work as well.
