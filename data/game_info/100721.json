I wanted to make 5 'zones', each one with a different tetris piece to collect at the end, but i made only one. So it's doesn't have much content, and you can finish it really quick!</p><p>This game was made using the engine i'm making on top of luxe engine, it's the same engine i'm using for Super 365 Quest and N\u00b07. I was thinking about turn this game into a shooter or something cool, but it dependes on the support since i'm already working in two game.</p><p>The music, programming, art and everything was made by me. It's a really small game, but i hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Thanks! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70d2388c406c83f296ba2d053bdc163a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eduardo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
