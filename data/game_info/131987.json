Overload volatile energy nodes before they self-destruct, but watch out for self-defusing modules; overloading their defuse protocol will have explosive results!</p><p>We've built an exciting experience that's quick to pick up to kill a few minutes but addictive enough for endless entertainment. How competitive are you? Instant replayability is perfect for hot seat multiplayer!</p><p>Pylons is still in active development because there's a lot of awesome stuff we want to add to the game over time. The current game is fully functional and playable, and all future updates will be free.</p><p>Have any questions?
