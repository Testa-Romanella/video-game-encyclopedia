Starting with the course's model game, I adjusted the look and feel of the UI elements and added the simple fruit and veg animations and a new non-space level 2.</p>\n<p>Then I went on and broke something without saving this stable version, so I can't make any more improvements or corrections at this stage - a super learning experience! I could rebuild it, but at the moment will spend my time on new projects to share.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>To play:</strong> Use cursors to move, left mouse button to fire and mouse to aim. <br/></p>\n<p>Basically just <strong>shoot everything</strong> and try not to get shot too much. Different snacks have different points if you're after a high score.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> Created by Louis Greenberg<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdb/fdb4be3e9e691c9e38faf4683dc26b7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["louisgreenberg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
