{"id": 12503, "slug": "sumo-revise", "name": "Sumo Revise", "name_original": "Sumo Revise", "description": "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's super fat guys free-styling!!!<br/><br/>Sumo Revise is a local-multiplayer brawler designed to harken back to the zaniness and replayability of couch-crowding games like Super Smash Bros. and GoldenEye 007, with a splash of silliness of games like QWOP and Surgeon Simulator 2013.FEATURES<br/><strong>INSANE, UNPREDICTABLE GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>Struggle to force your friends out of the ring in lightning-fast, ever-changing rounds. Grab power-ups to learn the secret abilities of the sumo masters. Don hats and costumes on the fly to confuse your opponents (and yourself)!<br/><br/><strong>EXOTIC LOCATIONS AND EXTENSIVE CUSTOMIZATION</strong><br/>Battle in seven different arenas in the far reaches of Sumo Land. Sharpen your skills with 12 different modes and gameplay modifiers, including Free-For-All, Capture the Flag, and Bacon. Create and share your own levels and modes for never-ending insanity!<br/><br/><strong>THE PLACE IS CRAWLING WITH SUMOS!</strong><br/>Play with up to 8 players simultaneously, or supplement with AI opponents if you're feeling lonely.<br/><br/><strong>REALISTIC SUMO PHYSICS?</strong><br/>Unfortunately, since they're so portly the sumos don't exactly maneuver well...Move wisely!<br/><br/>DISCLAIMERSSumo Revise is designed to be a local multiplayer game, and some of its best qualities are lost during online play. As such, Sumo Revise is at this time offline-only. BE ADVISED. Also, playing with 8 players simultaneously requires four gamepads, two keyboards, and a mouse. The extra keyboard is needed because keyboard hardware can only receive a few inputs at once. BE ADVISED.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d483d29e7facc126672696729d23406a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 404, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Szymanski", "John Szymanski", "Evan Szymanski"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["John Szymanski"], "esrb_rating": null}
