Is better to use more than one basket and if so how many?</p>Want to buy the full Unreal Engine 4 project?<p>If you are a Unreal Engine 4 dev and you want to see how the the game is made or you want to use some of the assets and materials for you game, or maybe you just want to make Egg delivery better! once you have bought the project files then they are yours. You are welcome to use the assets in your own game and make money from them!<br/></p><p>Egg Delivery is a blueprint project, there is no code at all. So great for blueprint users.<br/></p><p>It is Windows only, as I created the project on windows.</p><p>The project was made with Unreal Engine 4.76 so it can be opened with 4.76 or above, opening it with older versions is more likely to corrupt the files. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a7762c93d1361e7348bfe3b2d60a0db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jazz Cousins"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
