Stuck in this weird but personal place you try to get out. But it's not that easy. As you go higher in attempt to escape the ground becomes more unstable, moving faster and faster, can you get ahold of it? Will you be stuck in an endless-lop or will the day finally illuminate the darkness?</p>\n<p>Artistic, creepy platformer with random generation.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for PROCJAM in a week.
