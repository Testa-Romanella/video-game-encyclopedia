{"id": 783838, "slug": "routine-feat", "name": "Routine Feat", "name_original": "Routine Feat", "description": "<p>Summer days and no one around. An unnamed office worker pursues his dream, tormented by isolation and abandonment. No violence, no monsters, no haste, no conflict, except fighting your doubts. Swifts, butterflies, sunset rays on the leaves of trees; radio and TV, notepad and pencil; typewriter and retro computer; bus; overwhelming loneliness.<br />\nThe sky overhead and your dreams change together. In this game you&#39;d have an opportunity to sit on the roof, to fry scrambled eggs on the stove (without using a frying pan), to eat a stick of sausage alone and to flush your sneakers down the toilet. This is your Routine feat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-06T00:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2dc1d3aee3676041cddff790d33ab1d.jpg", "website": "https://sad3d.itch.io/routine-feat", "rating": 4.12, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 8, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 611, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["sad3d"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u0418\u041b\u042c\u042f\u041c\u0410\u0417\u041e"], "esrb_rating": null}
