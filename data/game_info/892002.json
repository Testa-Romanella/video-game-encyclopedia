They will be able to explore freely in a world and learn more about the previous inhabitants by searching through their remains. The players will have to work together to move forward and try to reach the end of the map. They will come across messages that will help them understand the world they are in.</p>\n<p>In order to communicate with fellow players, each puppet will have the ability to play musical notes using the VR controller. Each puppet will also have a song emitting dimly from them. The music coming from each player is all part of the same song, just different instruments.\r\n<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>To move use primary thumbstick\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Move around and get close to other players\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Explore the world\r\n</li><li>Press any button on the controller to communicate!
