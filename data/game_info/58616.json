{"id": 58616, "slug": "assassins-creed-odyssey", "name": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey", "name_original": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey", "description": "<p>Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey is the twentieth game in its series. It is the earliest game in the Assassin&#39;s Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The events of Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey&#39;s take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T19:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c6b/c6bd26767c1053fef2b10bb852943559.jpg", "website": "https://assassinscreed.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/home/", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 515, "owned": 4252, "beaten": 1362, "toplay": 685, "dropped": 531, "playing": 376}, "playtime": 32, "achievements_count": 437, "ratings_count": 1974, "suggestions_count": 641, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 2006, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Ubisoft", "Ubisoft Montreal", "Ubisoft Montpellier", "Ubisoft Shanghai", "Ubisoft Quebec", "Ubisoft Bucharest", "Ubisoft Kiev", "Ubisoft Singapore"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
