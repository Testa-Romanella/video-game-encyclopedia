She started to see the world very oddly, almost abstract. In this game I want to create this weird abstraction, caused by Dementia. The game does not really have an incentive or goal and has a creepy feel to it because of the unknown elements, which simulate the world as it could be with Dementia.</p>\n<p>This game acted as a sort of playground for me, in learning Unreal Engine. That is the main reason I used several models from sketchfab and did not really focus on\u00a0 finishing sound and gamedesign (incentives and story).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f58d0ff77131cc3f29e720f4faa2e34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maartenwolfsen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
