But what if in provincial Russia there are kids so harsh they can defeat the vile creatures from dreams?<br/>Three simple Slavic kids - Boris, Dora and Joseph - turned out to be daredevils. Why them of all? It\u2019s unclear, because in real life they have only three things in common. These children were born in the region of the Kursk magnetic anomaly, always obeyed their parents and they did not eat pork.<br/><br/><h3>In this card roguelike you can do the same as in every other:</h3>1) <strong>Play as one of three characters</strong> with different characteristics:<br/><ul><li><strong>Boris the Brave</strong>. The boy's greatest dream is following his father\u2019s example and become a boxer, but for now, monsters of his dreams are the only defeated opponents;<br/></li><li><strong>Dora the Adventurer</strong>.

Just whenever, whenever;<br/>3) <strong>Leveling the hero\u2019s characteristics</strong> that affect the strength of the cards;<br/>4) <strong>Jokes</strong> (at least attempt at jokes);<br/><br/><h3>The best way to support game development is add it to Wishlist.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T04:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecf69260bd9e771861aef5e50e2515d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Dog's Dream"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Dog's Dream"], "esrb_rating": null}
