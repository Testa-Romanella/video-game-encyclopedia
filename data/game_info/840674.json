L\u00f3pez</strong> and that has helped me to exercise <strong>C# code in Unity</strong>, in a structured way, from start to finish and narrated in a friendly way. It has been like having instructions and the plans of a model, easy to understand and useful for those who are not initiated in this world. I make it available, in order to continue learning and considering it as a first step to future extensions.
