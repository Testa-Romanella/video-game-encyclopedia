This project was created for me to learn and for you to enjoy, and will always remain free.</em></p>\n\n<p>A\u00a0fast-paced, almost boomer shooter with a gameplay mix of Wolfenstein 3-D, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and some Doom 3.</p>\n<p>The prompt is simple:\u00a0the nazis stole your dog, kill them.\u00a0Do you need more?</p>\n\n<p><em>What you will find in this game:</em></p>\n<p>- Nazis to kill.</p>\n<p>- Euro Jank.</p>\n<p>- Old school gameplay with lots of blood.</p>\n<p>- 4 levels made the old way.</p>\n<p>- Funny ragdolls.</p>\n<p>- 1 boss fight.</p>\n<p>- Classic wolfie weapons and some new ones (5 in this build).<br/></p>\n<p>- The journey of someone who 10 months ago had no clue how to make games.</p>\n<p>- A complete game, when it is done.</p>\n\n<p><em>What you will NOT find in this free game:</em></p>\n<p>- A store</p>\n<p>- Lootboxes</p>\n<p>- Microtransactions.</p>\n<p>- Season Pass</p>\n<p>- DLC</p>\n\n<p>This is an early build and as such will have some problems, although I've tested it extensively so no game breaking bugs should turn up.\r\n</p>\n<p>Currently there are 4 maps in this build, and the final build is projected to have 12-13 maps.\r\n</p>\n<p>I'm also very keen on adding mod support to the game in a later version, when I\u00a0have an idea of how to go about that.</p>\n<p>Some parts in some maps have performance issues, especially map 3. I'm running it on a relatively high end rig, so any feedback on performance is good.\r\n</p>\n<p>Likewise, any other suggestions or reports you have will be good to hear.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can find me here:\r\n</p>\n<p>via email at roger.creus@digitalrowye.com<br/>via Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/roger_creus_art\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T10:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b4d1f9614e6a318a3e3d8273156ba58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 368, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rowye"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
