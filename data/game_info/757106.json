Thankfully one of the best was buried in a graveyard some time ago, but wait just a minute! That's your graveyard! These fun loving monsters are inviting themselves over to take over your territory!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Seems like the only thing you can do is fight them off until morning comes once again. But the monsters seem to never stop coming, the nights seem to get longer, it seems the only thing you can do is delay the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Bury defeated enemies so they can't come back the next night, and stop them from throwing a monster rave!
