She's a good shooter, but \n      she's also klutzy and can be pretty sensitive at times. And she always \n      has a solution. Just not right now.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      The Secret Service just fired her. She has no money, no papers and no \n      idea how she got into this situation.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      But she'll be damned if she doesn't find out what this crap is all about \n      - to put it in her words.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Stranded in Miami, she now goes to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen \n      in years. And her mother has no inkling of Mia's real job\u2026\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      You will meet a wide variety of people over the course of this gripping \n      tale. Some will be on your side, others not so much. Proceed with \n      caution and be sure to look and listen closely.
