{"id": 259874, "slug": "short-circuit-vr", "name": "Short Circuit VR", "name_original": "Short Circuit VR", "description": "Short Circuit VR is an electronics lab simulator in Virtual Reality.<br/><br/>You can build your own electronic circuits with the components provided, learn basic electronics by completing challenges and just have fun while experimenting and making awesome projects!<br/><br/>For who is this game intended?<br/>While Short Circuit VR can be used as a learning tool for young and old, it can be used by hobbyists and anyone who wants to experiment and build things with electronic components.Main features<br/><strong>Spawn components</strong><br/>The player can spawn electronic components to build custom circuits. Here\u2019s a list of components currently available:<br/><ul><li>Wires<br/></li><li>Batteries (1.5V, 3V, 9V)<br/></li><li>Resistors<br/></li><li>Breadboard<br/></li><li>Diode<br/></li><li>LEDs (red, green, blue)<br/></li><li>Slide switch<br/></li><li>Pushbutton<br/></li><li>Potentiometers<br/></li><li>7 Segment display (common cathode)<br/></li><li>Photoresistor<br/></li><li>Buzzers<br/></li><li>DC motor<br/></li><li>Protoboard</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><strong>Receive feedback</strong><br/><br/>Get information about circuit components values (voltage, current, voltage drop, resistance, \u2026) when hovering over them with the controller. Easily detect errors in your circuit as you\u2019ll get a warning when doing something wrong (short circuit, open circuit, too much current, \u2026).<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Complete challenges</strong><br/><br/>The game includes several challenges to learn how to work with the basic components. Players will get a challenge description, a circuit diagram and some extra information to help them get started.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Save your work</strong><br/><br/>Short Circuit VR includes 10 save slots where you can save your progress in. It also gives you the ability to load save files from other users or save files downloaded from our website.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Import custom models</strong><br/><br/>Users can import their own custom 3D models (.obj files) with a material. These models can be imported during gameplay to customise your projects.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3a/e3a2141dc5ae8f4b58afaf2f11d36591.jpg", "website": "https://shortcircuitvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stefan Bauwens", "Cindy Ho"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
