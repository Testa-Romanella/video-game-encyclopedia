It is a simple homage to the golf games of the 90's. It is made using the wonderful\u00a0PICO-8\u00a0fantasy console in July and August 2020.</p>\n<p>picogolf (currently) contains a single 9 hole course featuring a range of par 3, 4 and 5 holes. There are no settings, nothing gets saved, if you wanna play again, just reload the page.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Everything is controlled using the arrow keys and the Z and X keys.</p>\n<p><strong>while aiming...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>left and right to aim</li><li>hold up to zoom out</li><li>press down to cycle through clubs</li><li>press X to cycle view modes between close up aim, distant aim, whole course and pin</li><li>press Z to start your shot</li></ul>\n<p><strong>while preparing a shot...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>press X to cancel if you haven't already started a shot</li><li>press Z to start your swing</li><li>press Z to indicate the power of your shot</li><li>press Z again to to set your shot accuracy, aim to be as close to the green marker as possible</li></ul>\n<p><strong>while driving...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>left and right to steer</li><li>hold Z or up to accelarate</li><li>hold down to brake</li><li>park up near the ball to take another shot</li></ul>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Always look out for the wind indicator, this will affect any shots hit into the air.</li><li>The number range to the bottom left of the screen indicates how well you might hit the ball. For example using a driver while in the bunker shows 20-100%. This means you could hit anything between 20% and 100% of your indicated power, so don't rely on it! Cycle through your clubs to see what your best option is.</li><li>The game will try to automatically select a suitable club, but it might not be the best one for you so give them all a go.</li><li>Hitting a ball into water or too fair away from the course will add a penalty stroke and reset your ball.</li></ul>\r\nWhat next?\r\n<p>I would love to add more courses but I've just about hit the limit of what I can code (Pico-8 limits the amount of code 'tokens' you're allowed to use). I would also like to add both local and online multiplayer. I've got a few other ideas, but I might have to save that for a different game engine.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>lexaloffle for making pico-8</li><li>kometbomb for their fade to black implementation</li><li>freds72 for their rspr implementation</li><li>Though made by me, the music is a crude remake of a couple of tracks from one of my favourite ever games, Everybody's Golf on the PS Vita.
