The art is all temporary, the mechanics are hopefully not.<br/></p>\n<p>This version contains 15 levels; They are not ordered by difficult and are not necessarily in the order they'd appear on the final game.</p>\n<p>I made this as an exploration of what's possible to do with a minimal set of mechanics and level geometry. Hopefully this will serve as proof of concept for a full-length experience. I'll be adding more levels/entities as I make them, as well as updating/removing existing levels.</p>\n<p>There's a known bug with the undo system where it just goes\u00a0 completely haywire sometimes for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it! Any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a5a270195eb7471ae4c9781dc1846e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["temdisponivel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
