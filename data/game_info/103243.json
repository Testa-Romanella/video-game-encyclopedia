{"id": 103243, "slug": "foreveracers-itch", "name": "Foreveracers (itch)", "name_original": "Foreveracers (itch)", "description": "<p>\r\n\tForeveracers is a bouncy wobbly arcade online multiplayer driving game. Jump in to the action with no fuss. Race, roam, roll, crash, and challenge as you drive around the game world day and night. Cut corners, find shortcuts and avoid other players while trying to set the best lap times or win the challenges.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Each car in the game has a distinct feel and unique characteristics, and the physics model means that balance is as much part of challenge (and fun) as the optimal racing line. And each car has their own 'optimal racing line', since as long as you hit the checkpoints in order, you're free to find your own route around the circuit!<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can challenge (and be challenged by) other players in the game to races or to special challenge modes. Everyone that accepts the challenge will join that game mode, and anyone that doesn't can just carry on driving as they were, maybe to join or issue the next challenge.<br/><br/>When not in a challenge, just drive through a start line to begin a lap, drive somewhere else to find another circuit whenever you want, or maybe explore to see if you can find an unlock for the hidden circuits. Or if you just want to quickly change car or jump to a different circuit, you can do so too.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>All one world - You're free to drive between the different circuits, and explore the world, without any reloading.</li><li>Day/Night cycle - The racing in Foreveracers never ends, so keep driving night and day.</li><li>Over 12 circuits - 4 initial circuits, 4 hidden circuits to find, and additional mirrored variants to then unlock.</li><li>Race challenge - Issue a race challenge to other players, those that accept will line up and race to the finish line.</li><li>Special Challenge Modes - If you want a break from the racing, then challenge players to a Scavenge Hunt or Rust-Bucket Survival challenge</li><li>6 Main Vehicles - from the slow and steady Starter Car, through to the 'too fast' Sports Car, and the frankly ridiculous Clown Car.</li><li>Leaderboards - See how your lap times compare to others (steam version only)</li><li>Live world rank - Your current world rank is displayed for whichever circuit you currently have active, try to improve your best time and move up to #1! (steam version only)</li><li>Ghosts - If you're just lapping alone then the 'ghost' of your best lap will start when you do.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Note For Solo Players</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We believe there is fun to be had with this game even if playing alone - start an online game and while waiting for others to join, you can drive, explore, time trial, try to improve your world ranking and unlock the extra circuits. However, we do want to make it clear that there is no single player 'story' or challenge structure, there are no AI racers in the game, so if you're only looking for a game to play alone/offline, then this may not be for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Steam Purchase Only</strong></p><p>The game is not currently available to buy through itch. Due to the way their pricing works, and the requirement for us not to sell less than the steam price (as we would want to include a steam key as the game utilises steam for leaderboards etc.) it's not practical for us to offer it for sale here at this time. If you are interested in the full game, please check out the game on steam.</p><p>We will continue to review this in future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d1f34fa3a40daaa53a6c7fc2c86bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperSmashingGreatGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
