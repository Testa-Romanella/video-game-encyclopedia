Even before you get on the scene there are signs that maybe this isn't just a simple missing persons case. Can you crack it? Explore Anteform Valley and its settlements, talk to its residents, search desks and files,\u00a0and build up your skills as you collect clues to figure out what really happened to Steve and maybe even prevent it from happening again. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Anteform is a weird detective story RPG in the style of the older Ultima games (Ultima I, Ultima II, Ultima III, Ultima IV, &amp; Ultima V) as played on the Commodore 64 and 128 computers (although thematically it fits in better with the Worlds of Ultima games). Just like the original Ultima games, it includes a world view, enterable towns, and 3D dungeon displays. More importantly, it is a fully playable (and winnable) game with its own backstory, plot, setting, and characters. It was written for PICO-8 using the Minima Engine and can be run on Linux, Mac, MS-Windows, and Raspberry Pi. It can also be played through the Web at:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=35093</p>\n<p>If you like Anteform you may also enjoy Minima.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to answer any questions about Anteform, but as it is a mystery RPG please be mindful and don't ruin the fun for others by posting spoilers or even any hints about what the story is actually about.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff89674766953686c7c5e60e0e311feb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Feneric"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
