Tap once then tap again to move in a direction, tap twice in quick succession to fire a shot, and tap three times to aim/rotate your ship without moving. Key inspiration to the idea was the sound, as the sound a player makes as they play the game sounds uncannily like Morse code.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35cb38fd9aa55a584c13aec2cbd35781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlightBulb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
