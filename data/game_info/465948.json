Try to\u00a0achieve a\u00a0monkeyness threshold, whereby the monkeys are out of control and take over all thoughts. I believe this is a struggle we deal\u00a0with in life everyday ;)</p>\n<p>A monk's eyes shows the monkeys in his mind!</p>\n<p>Thank you for stopping and playing! Hope you enjoy the mini game made from 48hrs of intense programming, bad pixel drawings with a mouse, and pizza!\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Notes/Tips:<br/>- Use of mouse required, left click to unleash the monkeys!<br/>- Windows versions are tested, but Linux and MacOS versions are not. Fingers crossed they work! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/37845e63a4fffbef334630fd171cbd17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wei Jiun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
