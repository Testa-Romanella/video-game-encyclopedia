This was not only my first time participating in the Ludum Dare, it's also my first game jam ever. I'm looking forward to doing more in the future.</p>\n<p>Everything in the game, from sprites to music was done exclusively by me EXCEPT for the sound effects (as such I will be opting out of the audio voting category).</p>\n<p>(You don't need to memorize these images by the way, the instructions are available in game)</p>\n<p>Edit: Sorry for the large download at the itch.io page. The Mac, Linux, and Windows versions are all in the same zip folder, so if you don't feel like waiting for the download you should just play the HTML5 version :smile:.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Sound Credit:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soundsnap User CRussomFX- Wall SFX</p>\n<p>Aturax Audio - Injury SFX</p>\n<p>Freesound User Pugaeme - Flamethrower SFX</p>\n<p>Soundbible User Mike Koenig - Zombie SFX</p>\n<p>Youtube User n Beats - Bat SFX</p>\n<p>Youtube User Hawaii ASMR Nature Relaxation - White Noise</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS (which I'm not going to fix as I'm supposed to be rated by what I made in the 72 hours)</p>\n<p>- You can skip Level 4 completely by making the Milkman walk through the zombie facing left near the bottom exit. He will only take one or two hits, but he can still reach the goal and load the next level despite not being supposed to. (A lot of people encountered this one. I probably would have caught it if I had the time to thoroughly playtest, but I literally made level 4 like 3 hours before the Jam ended.)</p>\n<p>- You can avoid the main puzzle in Level 4 by making the Milkman walk through the bat at the top of the screen at the right time. He'll only get hit once, and will survive without being hit a second time. (This one almost never shows up in regular gameplay, hence why I missed it. Even if you are trying to time it right, it's hard, and fairly obvious it's not the solution.)</p>\n<p>- The Milkman's sprite will sometimes clip into a controllable horizontal wall. Honestly don't know why this happens, but it's probably due to me messing up with origin points somewhere. The bug is only visual and will get fixed once the Milkman starts moving again. (You probably won't encounter this one unless you are trying to. It requires you to bring up a horizontal wall with pixel perfect timing. Thought I should mention this.)</p>\n<p>- There are three controllable walls at the bottom right of Level 4, two being horizontal, and one being vertical. The bottom horizontal one is supposed to stop the Milkman from being able to pathfind since it should be right over the destination point, but it doesn't. This is fine, as it was only designed as a crutch for people who were having trouble stopping the Milkman. The level was designed for people to not even need it, so this is fine. (This wall isn't lit very well since it is just barely outside of the light that the two other bottom right walls are in. Most people wouldn't even see the wall, which is honestly really dumb of my since it was designed to help struggling players.)</p>\n<p>- Fire particle effects from fire traps go way farther than the actual collision box, which only really matters in Level 4, because players might try to kill the bat with the right fire trap instead of the left one. (Okay I actually knew about this one, and since it was a really easy fix I decided to put it off and fix it later. I forgot.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:07:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a657fb16ef160d1b4936340dbadeed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Notic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
