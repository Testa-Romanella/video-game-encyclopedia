Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it&#39;s not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot...<br />\nThus the stage is set for Star Wars Racer Revenge, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2015-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T09:07:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7df/7df46e4b093a99def4db9469b5e61935.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.94, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 173, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 14, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 32, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 57, "reviews_count": 32, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Rainbow Studios"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
