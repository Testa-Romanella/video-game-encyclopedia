Trump.\u00a0I'm not a game dev <em>at all</em>, I hardly know what I'm doing, but much like Donald Trump, I didn't let ignorance or lack of technical competence get in the way of my dreams, which is to let people vicariously dunk on Donald J. Trump.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is repetitive as shit with no win condition, but I'm hoping that someone out there will find my endless dunker perversely therapeutic and lose themselves 2 tha dunk, babyyyyyyyyyy.</p>\n<p>Music by MegaPixel Music\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53cb06e55f2487c940a027f61a0aa5c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jayson Musson"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
