The goal of the game is to escape the room, easy right? It's simple, there is\u00a0a randomly placed key hidden in the room and you need to find it to open the door and escape! Have fun!</p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 days\u00a0for the Wowie Jam 3.0, a game jam where the theme was: Failure Is Progress. What better way to fit the theme than a classic escape room (The more you fail at finding, the less options there are)! This was very fun to make and I may further develop on it. All assets were made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/967/967c3cea39b67758006c637eeea0b0f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["suppliedcoot"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
