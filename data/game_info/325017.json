{"id": 325017, "slug": "grid-magic", "name": "Grid Magic", "name_original": "Grid Magic", "description": "This game is my take on the block-placing puzzle genre. <strong>The pieces don't rotate, but there is no gravity. Place them anywhere!</strong> Complete a line or a column and those block pieces disappear. Score bonus points for completing multiple lines at once, or for completing combo chains, or both.<br/><br/>You can choose to race against the clock, or take all of the time in the world. There are three modes to play: a <strong>Time Attack </strong>(a two minute challenge), <strong>Survival </strong>(where you score bonus time for completing lines), and <strong>Timeless </strong>(where there is no clock at all, and you have a set number of turns instead).<br/><br/><br/><br/>There is a fourth mode, called <strong>The Quest</strong>, which is a preview of a story I need to tell. How Grid Magic is real, and how we are all players in a game, until we choose to break the rules and make our own. I wonder if this description will be read, or understood. I hope so.<br/><br/>Besides, what's the point of being a technical witch if I can't wield some magic with your game?<br/><br/>If you want to pretend that all of this is marketing text, that's great. I've made a nifty puzzle game that I hope you will enjoy. Or maybe, just maybe, this game is the start of something a bit more important.<br/><br/>Join me. <strong>Join us.</strong><br/><br/>-- dera", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9684d8ef0030665254a692bc910739.jpg", "website": "http://gridmagicgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrea Davis"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Andrea Davis"], "esrb_rating": null}
