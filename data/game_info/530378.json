The story of the game is that you play as a ghost high school student who was so obsessed with grades that in order to move on, you need to break into the principal's office at your old school which has turned into a cursed maze full of monsters, traps, and mystery.</p><p>Move via the Arrow Keys, press space to jump, collect coins, avoid traps and monsters, and solve puzzles. For now, my job was to work on the UI and how it functions through the use of animations and sound effects. Enjoy the game and I'll keep adding to it in the upcoming months!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21e/21e4c53a59703e525485d21b7914ebdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugo Lopez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
