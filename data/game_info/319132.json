Perfect for those who aren&#39;t looking for a simulator experience with the ease of pick up and play, all the way to those who want a fast-paced challenging flight action game.<br />\nDogfight, strike, and fly through combat zones based off an alternate history of Earth. Either over the cold waters of the Bering Strait, attacking tanks in the brutal deserts of the Orient, or diving through the Red Woods to strike targets of opportunity in the Pacific North West, across the oceans, above the scarred lands of the world, this war will take you from exotic battlefield to exotic battlefield, all while going up against odds way above your pay grade.<br />\nPure Combat Flight Action<br />\nExotic weaponries such as railguns and geothermal-powered armaments will be ready to pluck you out of the sky if you&#39;re careless. Whether you are an attack aircraft pilot, skimming the ground with a gatling gun and rocket launchers attached to your wing, or an interceptor with long range, almost sniper-like missiles at your disposal, it will be up to you to prove yourself as an Ace pilot.<br />\nConquest Mode<br />\nIn Conquest Mode, fight in an uphill battle against various bosses and ace squadrons in a territory capture game, drawing elements from roguelikes and RPGs.
