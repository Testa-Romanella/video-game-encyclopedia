Use the left and right arrow keys to move your paddle. Guide the ball into the basket. Various obstacles will make it more difficult. The hole in the floor grows the longer you take.</p><p>This game has 10 levels.</p><p>Depending on feedback, I may continue development.</p><p><strong>Note: The ball bounce sound is a bit weird in the WebGL version.  I put this version out to help DL reviewers play my game easier. Please do not rate the game based on that sound. If that is an issue for you, please check out the downloadable versions.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c307a01bc7214da609020d229252de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Games By Candlelight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
