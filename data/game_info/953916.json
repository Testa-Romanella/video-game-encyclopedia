{"id": 953916, "slug": "robot-escape-dalia21", "name": "Robot Escape (Dalia21)", "name_original": "Robot Escape (Dalia21)", "description": "<p>Robot Escape was initially conceptualised as a side-scrolling shooter, where the robot was unable to shoot back at the humans, due to a directive preventing them from doing so, in the style of Isaac Asimov\u2019s novels. We had hoped to include more immersive story telling and additional content and power-ups.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the scope of our ambition was too large for a one week game jam, as is often the case. We settled on a simple side scrolling platformer, where the robot has to dodge obstacles and traps, and race to freedom.</p>\n<p>The game ended up becoming a bit of a rage game, due to time constraints. We weren\u2019t able to improve the gameplay beyond simply putting difficult traps in the way. The use of free assets, some of different resolutions, also made it very difficult to achieve a cohesive aesthetic style. The codebase is still in a state of some confusion, and some unsightly graphics proved unavoidable.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we both learned so much about Godot and game development in general. The game jam was well and truly a success for us both. We enjoyed the process of development, and are pleased, on the whole, with what we have produced. Perhaps this first attempt will provide some inspiration to us both for future game ideas.</p>\n<p>We hope that you too enjoy this game for what it is worth, and derive some inspiration of your own from our efforts :)</p>\n<p>Not for sale or commercial use.</p>\n<p>The code base and our other work can be found at https://github.com/Dalia-21.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c630fca01de8c3ea3327b96e327a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dalia21"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
