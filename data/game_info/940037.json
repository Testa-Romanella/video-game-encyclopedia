I played the game for the first time last December, and I wanted to explore what it would be like to implement its systems in a roguelike context. I think it works pretty well! Sadly I didn't have time to flesh it out and make it playable, but you might enjoy poking at it.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse: click any tile to take one step towards it.</p>\n<p>Keys<strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Melee attack - X</strong> (mouse over target)</li><li><strong>Ranged attack - Z</strong> (mouse over target)</li><li><strong>Reload - R</strong></li><li><strong>Stealth kill</strong> <strong>- S</strong> (mouse over target)</li><li><strong>Search container</strong> <strong>- S</strong> (mouse over target, containers will have a different colour)</li><li><strong>Throw molotov</strong> <strong>- T</strong> (will throw towards mouse)</li><li><strong>Use medkit</strong><strong> - M</strong></li><li><strong>Start/stop crafting - Tab<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Craft - Enter<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Change recipe - left/right arrows</strong></li><li><strong>Crouch/Stand</strong><strong> - C</strong></li><li><strong>Wait - Spacebar</strong></li></ul>\r\nOther Mechanics\r\n<p>Runners\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0red\u00a0arrow\u00a0indicating\u00a0the\u00a0direction they are looking (Clickers are blind).\u00a0Some runners\u00a0periodically\u00a0wander\u00a0around. Crouching makes you harder to see, but makes you move twice as slow.<br/></p>\n<p>Runners and Clickers will respond to sounds. The main sources of sounds are firing a gun (very loud), other zombies screaming (moderately loud) and walking (quiet, but Clickers will hear at close range - crouch to avoid this).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your melee weapon has limited durability, but attacking with it will stun an enemy, giving you an edge at close quarters if you're alone.</p>\n<p>Your ranged weapon is less accurate the further away it is.</p>\r\nNot Implemented\r\n<p>Sadly there's no ending (see if you can reach the end of the road), no sound effects (check the log on the left to see if a zombie has spotted you) and no way to find ammo or new melee weapons. I could've waited and implemented some of these, but I'm pretty tired and I wanted to slip something in before the jam ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a number of other systemic holes in the game - you can craft bombs but not use them, for instance, and there's a few bugs too. But there's enough there to get a feel for the game.</p>\n<p>Art was all made in Pixaki and edited a little in Aseprite. I had fun doing this!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:55:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4e2c7d48ecd9a70d2ebde77eadd740c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cut Garnet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
