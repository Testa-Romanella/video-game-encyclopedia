Defend yourself from the incoming aliens using the Programmer Universe Laser Vessel, better known as the PULVerisator !</p>\n\n\n<p>Rotate the PULVerisator in any direction you want to prevent the aliens from reaching the weapon. You can use mirrors to make the laser bounce and hit multiple enemies at a time !\r\n</p>\n<p>The more enemies you destroy, the more points you make! Survive as long as you can and make it up to the top of the leaderboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most powerful weapon in the galaxy has been created, and it attracts lots of malevolent aliens. But thanks to the hard work of the best scientists, mirrors have been dispatched all around the PULVerisator to help it defend itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vectrex was released in 1982. It was a monochrome console that used vector graphics. The controller only had a stick and four buttons.\r\n</p>\n<p>Our game tries to be as close as possible to the games that were published for this console, while innovating to make a whole new concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We developed the PULVerisator in a 4 days long game jam whose theme was retro gaming. Our team was given the constraint of making a vectrex game with a laser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game Programming\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Esteban Nunez / David Du / Julien Sadarnac</p>\n<p><strong>Game Art\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Judica\u00ebl Da Silva Opter / Angela Tran</p>\n<p><strong>Game Design</strong></p>\n<p>Soulaymane Guigon / Jean-Nicolas Carment</p>\n<p><strong>Game Producer</strong></p>\n<p>Enzo Gut</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T12:17:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f693c480f0e36b3f5a7f73ccdcc14010.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WhiteNoize"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
