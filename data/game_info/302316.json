According to some articles in the local press, a few days ago several bodies of dead tourists were found in the woods of North Carolina. And yesterday, another tourist said that he had seen a strange beast there, and it had had nothing in common with any of the known species. You are a local hunter whose house is located near the woods, and you are going there to trace the beast or, even better, to kill it. At home, you have to pack all the things you might need during the hunt, such as weapons and ammunition, medicines and food, etc., and to start out searching for the beast then. The main thing is to be as careful as possible, for you have no idea what is awaiting you there.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dac/dac68166ae15af21b0376f495283a518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiddy"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kiddy"], "esrb_rating": null}
