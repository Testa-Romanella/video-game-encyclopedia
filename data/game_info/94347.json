Our jump button also acts as a dash button if executed while airborne, both the dash and the jump can be used to eliminate the bugs. The dash can also be used in defence against the seeds the flower throws, turning the flower into a spring to reach higher areas if done correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>The game's executable package or binary</strong><br/>Windows executable file</p>\n<p><strong>Intended platform</strong><br/>PC Windows</p>\n<p><strong>Resources used</strong><br/>LibGDX<br/>Aseprite, Pyxel Edit beta, Tiled<br/>#SoftMilk32 palette by mnrart http://mnrart.tumblr.com/tagged/color-palette<br/>Made by Joe and Daniel, Spacefish Games</p>\n\n<p>Oh hey! Thank you for taking the time to look at our little game. This was our first gamejam, and our first \"completed\" project in game development (quotation marks used as we of course had more features and content in mind that time did not allow for). Needless to say we learned a bunch doing this, and would very much appreciate any and all constructive criticism and comments. We look forward to sharing more games with you in the future, and good luck to everyone who participated in the first (hopefully of many) GMTK Gamejam!</p>\n<p>Cheers, Joe and Daniel<br/>Spacefish Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108bf59072ed9ae575730d07bae23978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpacefishGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
