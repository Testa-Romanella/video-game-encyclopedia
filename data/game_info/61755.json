Mechanical updates, including new features and options <br/><br/>2. Content updates, including new heroes, areas, or new rooms<br/><br/>We will implement all mechanical implementations as free game updates. Why? Because we think of them as as steps to completion. The game experience will only be complete for us, once we added all our ideas.<br/><br/>We only want to make the game better, not more expensive. Whereas the content updates are more of a luxury, that aren't necessary to play the game, but additionally extend the experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f37064e7e8401bc9229dbb2d4a09a79.jpg", "website": "http://thequestgiver.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rest.less Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["rest.less Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
