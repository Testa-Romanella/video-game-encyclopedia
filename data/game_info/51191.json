Step up to the virtual table and show what you can do with a cue! In addition to the pool hall classic eight-ball, you can also play nine-ball, ten-ball and even snooker! Whether alone against the computer or in a duel against a real player on the same console, you'll send balls careening across the table in four selectable, highly-detailed rooms as you work your way up the high score list. <br/><br/>In 3D Billiards you can choose from ten attractive avatars as you duel against computer opponents of varying difficulty levels. Featuring an engaging pool-playing soundtrack, billiards enthusiasts will also be delighted by the authentic sound effects, like the clack of the balls, collisions, breaks and the characteristic way the balls roll across the table. Take aim, put a bit of finesse on your shot and play like a real pro!<br/><br/>1-2 players<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
