As they arrive at the scene, a dim light is flickering in one of the abandoned warehouse buildings. There appears to be something huge in the middle of the room. Rex turns to the wall and flips a switch, he is stunned. A heaping pile of Krash reaching the top of the ceiling lies alone in the room. Voices come from the distance, Rex and James pull out their guns waiting for the voices to come closer. James shouts out \u201cStop Miami P.D.\u201d. Fire exchanges back and forth. Shortly after, one of the wounded gang members touches the side of his head with his hand and whispers his final worlds \u201cHeat at Warehouse 7\u201d.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Heat at Warehouse 7 is a tower defense game with the spin that you have to keep track of multiple rooms to defend.
