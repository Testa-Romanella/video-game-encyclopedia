I had short nights, from\u00a0breakfast to sleeping time, I was working on it, to be able to make all the art and programming that I wanted to.\u00a0 So it would mean so so much to me if you could bypass the difficult installation and bugs to see how much I tried to give in this game. I promise you, it will be worth it :)</li></ol>\n<p>Tip : Don't go to the right after the first construction, there's a collider I forgot to add, so you will fall of the world, woops, woopsy XD\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you can't install it, try this one, it's the Unity file, it works better.<br/>https://marijenburg.itch.io/bill-webgl-version</p>\n\n<p>What's BILL about ?</p>\n<p>\"Bill procrastinates and accumulates stuff, it's time that he declutters and advances in his projects\"</p>\n<ul><li>You will collect your mess laying around in the house</li><li>\u00a0Recycle it at the crafting table</li><li>Build cool projects with the material that you got from recycling<br/><br/>Crafting, SimsLike, inspired by Stardew Valley</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you so much for trying it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b10ac19c500de5fc56f63aba3a902c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 335, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marijenburg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
