Well then you are in the right place. In this 2D shooter, you can play as a cloud and save the planet by shooting harmful greenhouse gases with water.</p>\n<p>The game works as following: - you have three kinds of enemies: carbon dioxide (red or white) and nitrogen monoxide, which you need to hit with water in order to destroy them.</p>\n\n<p>You have five health points and every time a cloud touches you or the top of the screen, you lose 1 health. You can restore health by picking up bonus hearts that float in the air.</p>\n<p>Enemies appear from the bottom of the screen randomly. After killing the first five enemies, a wave appears. Waves continue to appear throughout the game. You can collect power-ups that appear from the top of the screen to help you clear the waves.</p>\n<p>The game has an online leaderboard and a name editor.\r\n</p>\n<p>Join Rainy's discord server to contact creators or just to hang out.
