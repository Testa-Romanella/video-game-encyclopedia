{"id": 28284, "slug": "tenchu-z", "name": "Tenchu Z", "name_original": "Tenchu Z", "description": "<p>In Tenchu Z, you become the ultimate Ninja as you complete 50+ missions set in Ancient Japan to assassinate wrong doers, gather info, track enemies and collect or destroy targets using the art of stealth. Slash unsuspecting guards with a wide array of ninja weaponry on your way to slaying the big bosses. True Ninja mastery only comes with keen awareness of sound, sight and smell detection as you learn new moves and obtain new weapons and accessories. Patience and strategic thinking via use of the stealth kill system is rewarded over a run and gun style of hand to hand combat. Practice missions in single player mode offline, then grab your friends to team up for even more fun in multiplayer mode over Xbox Live or System Link.</p>", "metacritic": 56, "released": "2006-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-14T14:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/5584039ee0fcffb005ebec8a2732dacb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 134, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 43, "achievements_count": 31, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["Xbox 360"], "developers": ["K2"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "From Software"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
