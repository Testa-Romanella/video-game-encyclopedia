Take control of a commanding Engineer who has the unique power of Transmechia, that when casted on mechanical machines, grants them powerful abilities that can turn the tides of battle.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is to defeat the enemy Engineer\u2019s forces and to keep growing and customizing your army. A heavy tank can turn into a powerful magical machine that can call down meteors from the sky and scorch the earth. It grants mechanical robots the ability to combine their energies and form force fields that protect nearby allies from harm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because these abilities are so powerful, they take time to build up and only last a short time. Part of the strategy is using them wisely. Customize your army and deploy them onto the battlefield to engage the enemy. You can use areas of the environment to your advantage. Forests and trenches provide covering fire and high-ground improves firing accuracy. Using strategy and learning the strengths and weaknesses of each type of unit can mean the difference between victory or defeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Single\u00a0Player Campaign</li><li>Versus Mode (player vs player on same computer)</li><li>Turn-based combat</li><li>Use the terrain like High-ground and forests to your advantage</li><li>Game changing magical abilities that can obliterate enemies or protect you from harm</li><li>Customizable army that can be upgraded (in progress)</li><li>Strategize and outsmart your enemy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Firefly Studios</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ronald Hinh (Director)</li><li>Robert Thomas (Producer)</li><li>Austin Antle (Programmer)</li><li>Florian\u00a0Fiavre (Programmer)</li><li>Mark Kolpak (Art Director)</li><li>Nolan Ottmann (Designer)</li><li>Owen Parrish (Designer)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/565eaa4772249b4c6e857dbd6801f062.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rhduke"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
