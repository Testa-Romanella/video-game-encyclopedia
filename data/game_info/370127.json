For example:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- A stressful, twitchy rush with high speeds and short time limits in a roasting volcanic environment. <br/>\r\n- A safe and steady maximisation of score and health with 10+ minutes of tactically navigating air conditioning units, heater and freezer elements, fans, and ice.  <br/>\r\n- A relaxing and contemplative spiral ascent and descent of alpine peaks, free from time limits or health levels in No Pressure mode.<br/>\r\n- A measured, permadeath campaign across all levels with an accumulating score and elapsing 42 minute timer, enabling indulgence in high points areas and allowing the necessary focus in difficult areas if health and campaign time are managed well.<br/>\r\n- Play at your leisure in No Pressure mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIs it safe to speed boost through the last few checkpoints without falling down a gap? <br/>\r\nShould the level be restarted if it wasn't a perfect start? <br/>\r\nIs there enough time to accumulate a slightly higher score and then escape without a mistake? <br/>\r\nThese are some of the spiraling traps of speed and greed in Spiralagon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou Are The Hero!<br/>\r\nRun, Jump, Boost, and Teleport to save the high score and beat the fastest time.<br/>\r\nOvercome poor time management, and a lack of resource budgeting, <br/>\r\nand improve risk assessment skills. You can succeed", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T02:40:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/3133b8dbea39d7c9533b80dca8b68f9c.jpg", "website": "https://terminalbutton.net/Spiralagon-on-Steam/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terminal Button"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Terminal Button"], "esrb_rating": null}
