Nearly a century in the future, the world has fallen into a new ice age in the aftermath of a silent apocalypse. Only the equatorial regions remain habitable, yet pockets of humanity survive in small numbers all over the planet, hanging onto existence in the resource-rich territories to the north and south--resources that everyone wants to control... Protect the colony in the wastelands of old Russia from raiders, marauders, and horrifying creatures. Be the savior.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T22:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e73/e73941a0841edc72930b4dc865a410fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4A Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Oculus Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
