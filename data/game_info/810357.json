Any player may place continuous repeated wagers after every round regardless of how many prior wagers they have already in-play.</p>\n<p>A wager is lost if a number spun is equal to or less than the previous number.</p>\n<p>If a spun number is greater than the previous number, a wager rises on the Roulette Up board, incrementing by one line. As this streak of continuously rising roulette results continues, wagers will continue to rise until the streak ends. Wagers are then paid according to the payouts listed beside each appropriate line, up to a maximum of a streak of 8 which pays 100% of the progressive.</p>\r\nConsiderations:\r\n<p>This is a conceptual demo and does not represent a final product.</p>\n<p>Graphics are not representative of a final product, but an exercise to demonstrate a possible layout and framework of how Roulette Up might be included on existing roulette boards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:04:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a578e9be498b24aae3808aa142d0d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
