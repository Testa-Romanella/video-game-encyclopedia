It appeared in the September 1990 issue of The Rainbow, in the Novices' Niche section. You control a \"harrier\" like aircraft through a barrage of missiles. You need to maneuver left and right using the arrow keys,\u00a0 and guide your jet from the left and off the right side of the screen. Difficulty increases after 5 successful trips. You get a bonus jet after 10 successful trips.</p>\n<p>The original version in RAID.BAS for the Color Computer 1 and 2. I created new version (RAIDC3.BAS) for the Color Computer 3 that handles composite and RGB monitors, and uses the proper Color Computer 3 high speed poke.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:47:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df2444419357f734e181f3e97195a8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Can Ken Make It"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
