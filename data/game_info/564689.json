The theme for the jam was \"Chaos\"\u00a0 and it had a limitation of only using a certain set of keys on a keyboard.

With the limited keys it just created more chaos as the keys are not laid out in a convenient way to make the game easily playable.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0- Character will always more right.</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A - will allow you to glide while in air.</strong></li><li><strong>X - run faster.</strong></li><li><strong>B - shoot fireballs.</strong></li><li><strong>Spacebar - jump.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>A message from the creator\u00a0 - As with all my projects there are plans to improve and add more content.
