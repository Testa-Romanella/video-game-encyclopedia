The 2d hand and leg animation controller, tracks, &amp; checkpoints\u00a0were made by me. In the future I might continue to work on this and make it a sequel to my game Vacancy Unlimited. I hope you enjoy these tracks and they encourage you to also make something for blocktober next year! Crush my times and have fun everyone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T14:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3ed1cf310d59030f4a5839e6d1684852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Noah Lewin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
