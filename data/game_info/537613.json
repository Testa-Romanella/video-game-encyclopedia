I'm Wenzy.\u00a0 I'm a designer who focusing on generative art. You can find a lot of exploration on here (https://twitter.com/ziyangwen)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is my first time trying to make a game and provide some unique interactive experience for the players.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u300aBouncingMusic\u300b is a music game. By hitting the blocks with a ball to make sound. With the build -in physic system and composition of different blocks. Players can create unpredictable music. You can explore the relationship between the visual and the music.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It also provides some feature which can allow players using the Midi file. Player can create series of music visualization base on the piano pieces</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you are curious about how complicated the music can be made. Here is the video.</p>\n<p><strong>[ Music visualization of \" Waltz Opus 64, No. 2 in C\u266f Minor\"]</strong></p>\n<p>(The length of the block represent the pitch, all the animation is physic-based)</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And here is the \"Free Drawing Mode\" to draw random blocks to create random music.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Some screen shoot</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Current feature:<br/></strong>1.Three kind of blocks. Each block have different force mode<br/>2.Nine kind of sound. (synthesizer + sampling)<br/>3.Three mode - \u3010Free drawing mode\u3011\u3010Physic simulation Mode\u3011\u3010Midi prediction Mode\u3011<br/>4.You can import midi file to the game to create your own visualization (recommend website:http://www.piano-midi.de/chopin.htm)<br/>4.Some visual settings\uff1anight mode, background texture, rope effect...<br/>5.Support multi-language( English - \u4e2d\u6587 - \u65e5\u672c\u8bed)</p>\n<p><strong>Future update:<br/></strong>* Support midi input and output. You can create real-time music with some software like Ableton live or Fl studio.<br/>* More interesting visualize feature, More customizable sound<br/>* Add level for the new player to familiar with the operation</p>\n<p><strong>Notice:<br/></strong>* This game is kind of graphic heavy(involve physic simulation and some special effects), a high-performance PC is recommended! (In my testing, graph card above 1050 can play it smoothly)<br/>* The game is still developing. You can get all feature which show in the video and article. Once you purchase. You can get free update in alpha version constantly. If you want to support my work and get early access you can consider download it.<br/>* I will keep\u00a0\u00a0iterating the game. And honestly, I don't know what's the final form of the game. So it's hard to set a final price about the game. Now the price set a bit low so it's not include the full version in the future. But the support will get a steam key discount once the full version launch.<br/>* There is a discord group(https://discord.gg/gbVApPg). You can share your creation or\u00a0 give any feedback .\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Thank u:)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3eed45e26921a5aaf35d3e460a09cdf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wenzy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
