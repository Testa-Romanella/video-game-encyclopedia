Players can level up and battle with their Mythlink in hopes to form the best Mythlink Unity ever!</p>\n<p>So just what is a Mythlink? A Mythlink is a type of monster that players will select when the game begins. Once players have selected a Mythlink, a special bond begins to form between the player and their new friend. This link between player and Mythlink is called a \"Mythlink Unity\" and is so powerful that as one of you improves, so does the other. Because of this, players themselves will take part in various strength, dexterity, and brain training exercises to improve both themselves and their Mythlink. Who will you choose?<br/></p>\r\nMinorod\r\n<p>The rough and tough minotaur Mythlink who uses a mix of lightning and earth based abilities.<br/></p>\r\nGalest\r\n<p>The goofy ghostly Mythlink, utilizes tricky wind and dark based abilities<br/></p>\r\nUrusagi\r\n<p>The cute and cuddly rabbit Mythlink. Brings life to the party with sound and light abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mythlinks have 3 stats which can be improved through playing the game. These stats are strength, brain, and speed.

Both players will be placed high on opposite ends of the arena where they can view all of the action. From that vantage point, players will control their Mythlink and utilize abilities in order to knock out the opposing Mythlink. These 1 on 1 battles will showcase the fruits of all efforts put into training.<br/><br/>Each Mythlink has 30 abilities to choose from, most of which are completely unique to that Mythlink! Mythlink Unities can go into battle with up to 9 abilities equipped, so selecting your battle loadout wisely is key to victory. Will you go in with quick and low damaging basic attacks? Or come in swinging hard with big advanced moves? A mix of both? The choice is yours alone.<br/><br/>Last Mythlink standing wins!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T10:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84eba23bbb651b9ca648543b63256bec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HomePointGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
