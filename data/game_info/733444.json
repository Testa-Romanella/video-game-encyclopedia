{"id": 733444, "slug": "invincible-island-zx81-edition", "name": "Invincible Island ZX81 Edition", "name_original": "Invincible Island ZX81 Edition", "description": "<p>This is a port of the 1983 text adventure \"Invincible Island\" by Peter Cook for the ZX Spectrum. This is the first game I have created and published using my own custom engine, MATE (Mancave Adventure Text Engine),\u00a0designed for low memory microcomputers and primarily targeting the 16K ZX81, although in time I will look to port to other systems. Using the MATE engine and associated scripting tool I\u00a0was able to create the game across two evenings!</p>\n<p>Due to memory limitations there are some differences between this and the original 48k Spectrum version which are documented in an attached text file (spoilers inside!).\u00a0Despite this, all the locations with their original descriptions are present, as are all but two items. Overall I would say 95% of the original game is present and it retains the same feel as the original.</p>\n<p>The game is a .p file which you can play in an emulator (e.g. EightyOne) or convert to wav and load on original hardware!</p>\n<p>Any feedback, comments, and bug finds welcome!</p>\n<p>Here is the blurb from the original release:</p>\n<p><em>INVINCIBLE ISLAND is the primitive ancestral home of the mysterious Xaro tribe. Untouched by civilisation, legend tells that these island savages guard the unimaginable treasures of their first great leader, Xaro himself.</em></p>\n<p><em>Fortunately, you have more than just legend to guide you. Whilst on Invincible Island, Dr. Chumley, the world famous explorer, sent out a last desperate message in a bottle. Amongst his pleas for help and rescue was a vital clue: \"First find the Seven Parchments of Xaro\". He was never heard of again - perhaps the natives were hungry!</em></p>\n<p><em>Armed with this information, your quest is to find the seven parchments, which, if Dr. Chumley was right, should lead you to the treasure. But remember: treasure is no use to you unless you can escape with it - alive!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T06:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/78317679d9c0545a63c4d915bc6c41ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mancave Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
