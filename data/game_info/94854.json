The characters play on archetypes, but each is fleshed out via dialogue and feels well-drawn. From gung-ho soldier Meat to prickly ship's surgeon Strauss, I was surrounded by people I immediately gave a shit about. That's key to good survival drama, and writer/designer Javy Gwaltney has a great ear for action/sci-fi dialogue.\" --Polygon</p><p>\"This game has quality in spades. The writing is excellent \u2013 to begin with I wasn't particularly convinced that horror could be done well in a text adventure format but by the end of the first section I was completely engrossed. The pacing is excellent and the way the story responds to your choices feels organic and smooth. The framing of the options as specific utterances or general actions allows the player to imbue the protagonist with a huge amount of character and I was able to easily play out the type of person I wanted to.\" --IndieHaven</p><p><em>\"</em>With 60 possible endings, over 50,000 words, 2 protagonists and dozens of difficult, story-altering choices to make, The Terror Aboard The Speedwell is a unique piece of interactive fiction you'll just have to play over and over again. Yes, over and over and over again, for this is an excellent sci-fi horror adventure that manages to have properly interesting characters, panic inducing set pieces and can unravel itself in all sorts of melancholy/gory/heroic/sweet/unfair/deadly ways.<em>\"  --</em>IndieGames.com</p><p>\"[<em>The Terror Aboard The Speedwell</em>] is more substantial than most Twine games and has a big cast of characters all of whom have detailed attitudes towards one another. After a linear setup, it branches fairly strongly \u2014 I played to three substantially different endings, as well as some smaller variants on these. There are some good set-piece moments, too; <em>Speedwell</em> does particularly well on the scenes where the protagonist is realizing that whatever just happened spells probable doom for everyone, even though the symptoms aren't yet in evidence. Overall, <em>Speedwell</em> is more about how you cope once the monster is definitely out than it is about the time you spend thinking about what might be under the bed.\" --Emily Short</p><p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p><p><em>Is The Terror Aboard The Speedwell a sequel to You Were Made for Loneliness?</em></p><p>Yes and no. TTATS takes place in the same universe 180 years after the events of YWMFL. It features all new characters.</p><p><em>How long does it take to play?</em></p><p>A single playthrough of TTATS can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. Successive playthroughs will probably be shorter.</p><p><em>What do I get when I purchase a copy of The Terror Aboard the Speedwell? And how much does the game cost?</em></p><p>The game itself, the Twine source file, and a digital copy of the illustration that artist Elizabeth Simins drew for the game.  Oh, and maybe some eventual free DLC too.</p><p><em>DLC?</em></p><p>Sure.  For every 75 dollars the game makes, I'll write a small 3,000-6,000 word  backstory game for each character of The Terror Aboard the Speedwell that will become available for free to everyone who's purchased a copy of the main game.
