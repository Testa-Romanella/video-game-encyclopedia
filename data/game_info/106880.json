The game is about getting from one side of the screen to the other without dying. This might sound easy enough but a single touch from a spike will instantly kill you and send you back to the start of the level.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAll levels consists of a single static screen filled with hazards. If you think you have what it takes, give it your best shot. This game is not to be considered easy.\r\n</p><p>The story is told with the help of signs placed in the levels and it progresses as you complete levels and get further. Its a bit vague and has a really creepy vibe to it. If you dont care about stories and just want to focus on gameplay you are free to do so in this game.<br/></p>Game Features<ul>\n<li>Challenging Gameplay</li>\n<li>Jumping</li>\n<li>Gamepad Support (Xbox 360 tested)</li>\n<li>Auto Save System (Continue on level you quit on)</li>\n<li>A Bar</li>\n<li>Booze Powerups (Dont drink &amp; drive kids)</li>\n<li>Varied Level Design</li>\n</ul>Links &amp; Stuff<p>\r\n\tTeam Jape Website\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGame Page\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tUnity WebGL (Play Now, in Browser) \r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81e5c90d15ee182ba351925d4dd59c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Team Jape"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
