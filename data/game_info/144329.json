That event consists on creating a game on 72 hours according to a certain subject chosen by vote by the community who participates in the Jam.</p><p>This competition, although doesn't have prizes, it's an experience which provides the opportunity of working as a team against the clock and testing your developing skills. No without troubles we got to make a finished version of what could be a bigger game. The proposed theme this year was 'an unconventional weapon' and after a long brainstorming, we came out with an idea: our game would be about an interstellar traveler, a galactic researcher who uses holograms of important historical events in the history of mankind contained in an old space probe as a weapon to advance and overcome various obstacles. Too weird? Try to play and then you will understand better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40d82d6e4a7e2f5084260f3ee0ff85ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No Wand Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
