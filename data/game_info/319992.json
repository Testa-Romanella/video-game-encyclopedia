You have to avoid the obstacles and reach the end. There are a total of 15 levels right now, but there are more to come. I myself have never been able to complete this challenging game, so have fun and tell me if you beat it. Also tell me about any bugs/glitches so I can get them fixed as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:51:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2f/b2f4e3e48dbd52e9108bfe6a3eb46f0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MysticalGreen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
