It's mostly about collecting money and getting new moves to progress. The game features a world map, saveable progress, talking NPCs, a few bosses and a bunch of hidden areas. Getting the best ending might take a while!</p><p>This is my first game release ever. It was made in two weeks, so it's rather short. I didn't know how to do stuff back in 2005, so the game controls are not customizable.</p><p>The music was made by the awesome Sean Cameron (aka Rudy Fox).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b420d3d92c148beb762292b064ee08c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["origamihero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
