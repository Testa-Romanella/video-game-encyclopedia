In the official fanbook\u00a0<em>The Grimoire of Usami</em> (\u79d8\u5c01\u5036\u697d\u90e8\u7570\u754c\u64ae\u5f71\u8a18\u9332), characters use Danmaku to imitate fireworks. I think it is an interesting idea and use it here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Spring Festival (Lunar New Year) is coming. Three Youkai from China, Meiling, Seiga and Junko decide to celebrate the festival by hosting a fireworks show -- of course, with their Danmaku.\r\n  </p>\n<p>People make bets during the show, guessing who will be the master of fireworks, providing the most splendid performance.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Reimu will not miss this opportunity to make money.   </p>\n<p>However, holding the same intention, Yachie Kicchou from Animal Realm comes to Gensokyo. There will be only one winner in the gamble.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Objective</strong></p>\n<p>Control Reimu to earn more money than Yachie at the end of the festival.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p><p>https://github.com/Chaosinism/thjam5</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n<p>Engine - Godot</p>\n<p>Graphics - Clip Studio Paint, GIMP, Texture Generator</p>\n<p>Music - LMMS</p>\n<p>Fonts - VT323</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/600/60066c86555f588f6b8756d3ed2b83d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Chaosinism"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
