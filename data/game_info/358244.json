In addition Germans committed all their Luftwaffe reserves into this undertaking, named Operation L\u00fcttich.<br/><br/><br/>The Allies realized that if they could contain this last German attempt to take the initiative in Normandy and swing around the American forces which had broken through, they might be able to encircle the 7th German Army and the Fifth Panzer Army in the Falaise area.<br/><br/><br/>The only one thing was sure: At the end of this maneuvering either several German or American armies would be cut off and that side would suffer losses measured in hundreds of thousands of men - the scale so far unprecedented on WWII Western Front.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>+ Thanks to all the in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you want to test this WWII game, a free 20-turn version is also available<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password.

The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming mechanics TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any solo indie developer could dream of. If you have feedback about this board game series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth chat without the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if there is a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will get back to you.
