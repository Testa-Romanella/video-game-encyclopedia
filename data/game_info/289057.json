Game is still in early development but you can keep updated about the project by following this game page page or following me on twitter. You can also contribute with bug reports or feedbacks on our the reddit community r/Dojokratos!</p>\n<p>There is a beta version of the game that contains the intro stage. It should give you a feel of what the game will be like, but it does not represent the final state of the game as I will add way more features.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to download and test the game and <strong>I'd be very glad if you'd spare a little bit of your time to leave a feedback or report any bug</strong> you'll eventually find in this beta version (and be aware, there'll definitily be some!).</p>\n<p>Thanks and I hope you enjoy the game!
