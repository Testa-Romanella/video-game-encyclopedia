These smells passed through the nose and entered the brain, making people tremble.<br/>Just as I was shrinking, a dark-skinned young girl emerged from the shadows, blocking the only way I could leave.<br/>A strange smile appeared on the girl's face, and there was something strange in her hand.<br/>Its color is light-colored like a corpse, the whole is round, and it does not appear naturally, but the top is cut and decapitated by a sharp blade, exposing a dark liquid that seems to overflow.<br/>Only then did I realize that the suspicious smell lingering on the tip of my nose came from this black liquid, spreading around as if it had become substance and malice.<br/>Under the light, the smile on the girl's face became more terrifying, and her lips made terrible words.<br/>\"The coffee is brewed.
