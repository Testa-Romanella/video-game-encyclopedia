The twist comes in the form of multiple\u00a0pivoting platforms, which was surprisingly difficult to accomplish on 2 hours of sleep, and the\u00a0conclusion comes from the pivoting platforms leading to a tree of Jewels.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Brackeys on YouTube for the helpful tutorials and starting mechanics and kit.</p>\n<p>Ansimuz for the free assets.</p>\n<p>inScope Studios on YouTube for the help with the collectables.</p>\n<p>Dr. S, for continuous engaging lectures.</p>\n<p>My therapist for keeping me sane.</p>\n<p>&amp; Christmas Break for being the light at the end of the tunnel.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/965b41f4b00ca50bb79fa9b10d9d100b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EmmaAbigail"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
