I regret taking that &quot;game&quot; from work. It took from me what was most important in my life. That is why soon I will be swallowing a bullet from my police issued revolver.</p>\n<p>We had been called to check on a resident at an apartment complex. Neighbors were complaining about the smell and the landlord called the police. We first knocked on the door and tried to call him out, but no one answered. When we forced open the door, we found his limp dead body sitting in front of a PC. His face was partially torn away, part of the flesh dangling like cobwebs from the skull. We secured the body and any clues for what looked like a possible homicide. The coroner, though, determined from the guy\u2019s fingernails that the wounds were self-inflicted. \u201cHell of a way to kill yourself,\u201d I said. Now I know that the poor guy probably just lost it.</p>\n<p>We didn&#39;t make any progress finding any reason for the suicide. The PC didn\u2019t help much either, nowadays you expect to find a suicide note on facebook or twitter. There wasn\u2019t even a word document that began with dear mom and dad. We did find a single folder titled &quot;Townlore.\u201d It was some kind of computer game, pretty boring too.</p>\n<p>After the case closed, I made a copy of the game to give it to my son. It is common to take items from people that don\u2019t use it anymore from the evidence locker. If you go to a police auction, you know exactly what I mean. I thought that the game was simple enough to entertain a young child. Being a single father is tough and sometimes I just needed him out of my hair.</p>\n<p>Although, gameplay wasn&#39;t anything fancy, he did enjoy it. One night I even caught him playing past his bedtime. I grounded him from the game, but like most kids he didn\u2019t listen.</p>\n<p>Someday after that he ran to me pale as a sheet. I asked him what was wrong. He answered, &quot;Pandora is resting.\u201d I asked him who Pandora was and he responded, \u201cThe girl locked inside the game.\u201d I just laughed it off as one big joke. Deep down, I started to get suspicious of this game so I started playing. If there was something on it that my little boy shouldn\u2019t see, I\u2019d simply delete it.</p>\n<p>However when I tried to continue the game from my son\u2019s save, it crashed. I decided to try playing a new game, but there was no gameplay. I reinstalled the game and realized that there was a save state. If I couldn&#39;t play the game from the beginning, I could continue from when it was playable.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t know how to progress in the game. So I made the mistake of posting it online and tried to get help from other gamers. After that, my son started acting strange. I woke up with a start one night because he was standing beside my bedside just watching me. I asked him what was wrong; he responded by saying, \u201cI can hear her crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then it happened, I heard a crash in the bathroom. I found my son lying face down on the ground. Somehow he had gotten into the medicine cabinet. There was a bottle of pills still being clutched in his tiny hand. He had taken so many pills that there were empty bottles and pills scattered everywhere. He choked and died in my arms that night. It was all because of that game. The last guy that played it killed himself. Now my son was on its victims list. By time I tried to pull the game off the internet, it had spread like a virus. Now all I can do is give you this warning:</p>\n<p>DON\u2019T PLAY THIS GAME LATE AT NIGHT.</p>\n<p>DON\u2019T GO INTO THE FOREST.</p>\n<p>FOLLOW THE RULES.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-05T21:29:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc6ca8872f600fca9dbbdf4a2b0f0ea.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/games/townlore/23376", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
