Froggo slips and slides around, and moves faster the WETTER he is. While out of the water, Froggo will dry out over time - slowing him down, and eventually stopping him altogether. Our amphibious friend needs to stay wet by splashing in puddles and swimming in bodies of water. However, if he gets too wet, he\u2019ll drown.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Keyboard &amp; Mouse (\u2328\ufe0f\ud83d\uddb1\ufe0f)</p>\r\nWalk\u00a0W,A,S,D\u00a0 or\u00a0Arrow KeysJumpSpace<br/>Slide<br/>Shift<br/>PauseEscape\r\n\r\nAbout the Project\r\n<p>Our goal with <strong>Froggo</strong> was\u00a0to create a light-hearted and engaging side-scroller, where you can play as an adorable frog and save tadpoles.</p>\n<p>This project is a Global Game Jam 2022 submission for our small community discord server,\u00a0 \"McSingles\".\u00a0 After the jam, we hope to develop it further!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n    Credits &amp; Social Links<strong>Name</strong>RoleSocial LinksMichael WolfGame Director,\u00a0Lead Engineer<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah ChoLead Illustrator\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Kei MatsuoAudio Designer\u00a0<br/>Seth LeueComposer\u00a0Joshua BalthazarProduction Coordinator<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joel LeeProgrammerJon WestDesignerAlex PinedoProgrammerNoam EganIllustratorInstagramFaraz ArdalanSound Designer<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T04:07:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac34c40a7edaa254f1feb4bad82601da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexisPinedo", "Michael Wolf", "Jonch_Baklava"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
