In the game, you are presented with a broken sudoku puzzle that you must put back together like a jigsaw puzzle. Very calming, but colorful. I don't believe I have the final build of the game, but this is the last known good build that I have.\r\n</p>Gameplay:<p>\n</p>Credits:<p>\r\n\tMaddie Duque: Programmer, Artist, Designer<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDaniel Hua: Programmer, Artist, Designer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tJordan Tick: QA\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tKoganti Rikky Roy: Programmer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLogan Joseph Smith: Producer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fe/8fedb64feda268c6c9903ad1b7d92f4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChickenHat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
