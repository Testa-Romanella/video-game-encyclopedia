Each has their own set of stats and behaviors. You can make handguns and rifles or sticky bomb launchers and laser guns. It's up to you, with more possibilities\u00a0being added. Once you have your weapon, you can assign it to one of 3 load-out\u00a0slots, then take them into battle! You choose maps (currently 2), mission types (currently 3), and from that you can level up and earn \"scrap metal\" which is used to buy more parts to make your weapons bigger and better.</p>\n<p>Also a note, you can find the controls in-game in the Settings menu.</p>\n<p>Anyway, please leave feedback! I'd love to hear your ideas or hear of any bugs and so on that you may find.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/889ccfb33313bda979b620bd1bd9ff6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JTrocks55"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
