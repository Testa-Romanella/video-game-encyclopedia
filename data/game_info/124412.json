New friends arrive by the boatload, but she is unable to accept their love, as touching them will cause existence as she knows it to be obliterated. Instead, she must end their lives without mercy, and constantly run around to prevent the ground from disintegrating. But each time she does, she wonders: Is a world that requires her to kill just to keep it alive truly a world worth saving? Perhaps it would be better to step off the edge and let this world vanish into oblivion...</p><p>But she perseveres. Ever diligent, ever moving, ever isolated. The lonely cylinder.</p><p>This game evokes thought, introspection, catharsis. As you play, you might discover that the real lonely cylinder was you all along.</p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 38.
