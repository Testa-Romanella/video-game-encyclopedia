It's also hungry!</p>\n<p>You leave a trail while moving, which the Monster follows, but there are ways to make it go astray...</p>\n<p><em>Superchase Remix</em> is called like that because I remixed three different versions of the same game that got published in Compute! magazines and books in the early '80s (the original Vic-20 version was published on October 1982, so exactly 40 years ago).<br/></p>\n<p>The game is written in XC=BASIC 3.1, XC stands for \"Cross Compiled\". Find more details and the documentation on its website.</p>\n<p>This game is open-source!
