There is no more use in destroying the Human World, as you can now use this new Monstruous Date'n'Meet Application.<br/>***<br/>Guess what the game is not finished, but i had a great time with friends around and there is still some *playable* material. Use arrows and space, select a date and fight in a FF / Pokemon poor-look-alike.
