Use your phone's gyroscope or touchscreen to aim your guns, and touch either red button to open fire.<br/><br/>Guns! Rack your twin .50-cals to defend your bomber against the ever-growing waves of Axis fighters.<br/><br/>Planes! Me-109s, FW-190s, Bf-110s, Me-262s; whatever the Axis can throw at you.<br/><br/>Lives! You only get 5. Once 5 enemy fighters make it past your defenses, it's game over for you and your flight crew.<br/><br/>Ammo! As in unlimited, you'll never run out! Just keep an eye on how hot your guns are; if they overheat, the enemy won't wait for them to cool down before swooping in for the kill.<br/><br/>This game is graphically demanding, which means it will gleefully eat your battery. Don't play if you're without a charger and waiting for that call from the hospital to let you know your new kidney has arrived.<br/><br/>If you're aiming using your gyroscope and it drifts out of alignment (or you want to face a different direction), just point your phone at where the \"center\" should be and hit the Align button at bottom left.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc0fe3134dcc78a46b40f4b44642a1bc.jpg", "website": "http://panicensuessoftware.com/TailGunCharlie/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Panic Ensues Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Panic Ensues"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
