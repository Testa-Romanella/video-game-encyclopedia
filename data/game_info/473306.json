Dodo certainly likes dancing, because he moves and spins in a particular pattern which often don't lead to vitory. You can alter his movement pattern by placing stop signs on the level. Press LMB to place a stop sign (if you have any) and RMB\u00a0to remove it. Then press play or SPACE to see how Dodo heads towards\u00a0his doom step by step. However, Dodo's demise is not a part of intended experience, so feel free to restart with R\u00a0whenever you feel like it. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee7dbf2dae90c6a3fd5c559a0ec7464b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NBG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
