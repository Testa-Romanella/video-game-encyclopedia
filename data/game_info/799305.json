Explore the world, uncover mysteries, customize your hero, and enjoy the freedom of Gallantia.<h3>Explore Gallantia</h3><br/>Myths of Gallantium features a vast open-world with three major continents, each with different styles and civilizations, connected by an open sea filled with smaller islands and archipelagos. Stay on land, grow your character, kill bosses, solve puzzles, or conquer the arena. Or, build your own sail ship and go ahead to explore the waters. Sail the seas, hunt treasures, trade goods, or become a pirate. Why not do it all?<h3>Build Your Character</h3>Customize your character any way you want, from visual appearance, to play style. The game features 7 distinct skill-trees: Knight, Hunter, Mage, Angel, Paladin, Rouge, and Summoner; but you are not limited to just one. Player's can mix and match up to two skilltrees at the same time, making crazy combinations to suit any play style.<br/><br/><br/>Want to play as a defensive tank? Knight-Paladin is for you. How about a healing-stealth killer? Angel-Rouge is your pick. Mage-Summoner? You got the idea. Go ahead, try them all, if you change your mind you can rebuild the character at any point anyway.<h3>Shape The World</h3><br/>You can create up to three custom characters living in the same world, each with their own progress, stories, and relationships. Construct houses, farms, build relationships, grow skills - delegate different characters to different things.

Or, of course, you can force everything into one hero - its up to you.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Flexible classes</strong> - the game does not force you into predetermined classes.
