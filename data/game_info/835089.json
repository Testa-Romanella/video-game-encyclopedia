No matter how old you grow, every summer when cicadas sing, you can still remenber of your childhood dreams, childhood friends with whom you share memories, and those pure and shining love like crystal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Those friends who had been together with you day and night, the small space that is inconspicuous but carries the boring years of the whole youth, those delicious street food carved into the memory, those meaningless noise and jokes, seem to be forgotten in the busy days of adulthood. However, it can light up your life again in those scarred midnight after being tempered by reality.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Although the dim light in the starry sky is hidden under the sun and moon, it has been illuminating every dark night. I hope such a quiet summer story can bring you a bit of beauty and coolness.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T04:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/217/21742fa5b4a096311de180a2b897badd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mingyu Information Technology Shanghai Co"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mingyu Information Technology Shanghai Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
