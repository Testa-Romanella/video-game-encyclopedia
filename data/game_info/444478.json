{"id": 444478, "slug": "thermosaga", "name": "ThermoSaga", "name_original": "ThermoSaga", "description": "<p>Created as a last-minute entry into Team Dogpit's SimJam, ThermoSaga puts you in control of someone who has only one goal in life: <strong>to be maximally comfortable</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you're not the only one with dreams of comfort. Your roommates (which vary in number at your discrepancy) have their own temperature preferences!</p>\n<p>Battle your roommates. Take control of the thermostat. It's the only way.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Choose your desired number of roommates (from 1 to 101).</li><li>You will be assigned a random \"comfort zone\" (bottom-right).</li><li>The thermostat shows the current room temperature (left) and the setpoint, or desired temperature (right).</li><li>Use the controls on the thermostat to adjust the setpoint by clicking them.</li><li>If the room temperature goes out of your comfort zone, you will begin to take damage. Take too much damage, and <strong>you will die</strong>.</li><li>While the room temperature is within your comfort zone, your comfort meter (bottom of the screen) will begin to fill up. Once it's full, you've <strong>won</strong>!</li><li>The sweet spot of comfort lies directly in the middle of your comfort zone. The closer to the sweet spot, the faster your comfort meter will fill up!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Beware</strong>: your roommates have randomly assigned comfort zones, and, like you, will die if they aren't comfortable. They will adjust the thermostat to their own liking... even if it means they have to kill you.</p>\n\n<p><em>Will you be the king of comfort...?</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:31:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a08/a085918ef8c80920977f64bab1cfbc63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["xezton"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
