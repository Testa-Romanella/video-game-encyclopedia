The British Army and its Native American tribal allies engage in battle against the United States Continental Army and militia forces. Take aim and fire muskets, prepare bayonets and take control of the battlefield to succeed in your campaign for final victory. Combat will vary from long-range rifle marksmanship to brutal close quarters hand-to-hand melee fighting. You will need a mix of first person combat skills and quick-thinking strategy to survive. So prepare yourself to do battle for your side and to meet the enemy head-on. Only one side can be victorious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-01T07:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/950/950746145cbae2c09aa5adddeaf996ea.jpg", "website": "http://www.bg2mod.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Battle Grounds Game Development Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["The Battle Grounds Game Development Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
