Use WASD or arrow keys to move/jump, and avoid falling and/or freezing. The Frostbiters will fly after you, and will suck heat out of you if you don't run away. Keep in mind this is a demo, and may or may not be developed further in the future, so have fun playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c3/0c3647e05f54850bb15fa53bd780470b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DragonChemist"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
