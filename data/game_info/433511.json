Go around collecting pollen to revive your dying Flower of Life. Birds want to eat you, dodge them or get drop pollen on them for revenge and bonus points. Oh, and you're too big to fly up for long without resting, so be careful when flying high! Try to keep the flower - and yourself - alive as long as you can. Can you beat the creator's high score of 19858? Brag about it in the comments!<br/></p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>A song, 6 sounds effects, a few nice sprites, a lovely decaying pixel flower, the ability to fly, and one big level to survive in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b3/5b3137a602243f6526a809ba208cd026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Curtamyth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
