The result was a game I called \"Seasons\", and I posted it on my website here:\u00a0http://studiohunty.com/seasons/</p>\n<p>A few months later, I added a santa hat to the character, changed the name to \"Seasons Greetings\", and submitted it to a holiday-themed game collection.</p>\n<p>I've very recently gotten interested in VR development (behind the curve as always), and it occurred to me that Seasons might be a good candidate for conversion. I've also felt weird about having turned the game into a \"Christmas game\", especially since holiday-themed games are only relevant one month of the year, and even then nobody actually seeks them out. So I set the santa hat to only appear if it's December, and updated the game to the latest version of Unity, and made some minor changes to make it work in VR.</p>\n<p>Note that the first vignette, \"summer\", is a little motion-sickness-inducing, but it's short, and the rest of the game is a lot less problematic.</p>\n<p>Give it a whirl and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T09:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/041726ad336b99a952836c6fb2bd4a5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["luvcraft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
