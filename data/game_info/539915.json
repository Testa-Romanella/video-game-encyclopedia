You play as a Robot Soldier, left to be the sole defender of an ancient castle. Alien Invaders are attacking, and it's kill or be killed! The aliens attack from all sides of the castle courtyard, so watch your back! Aliens are ruthless beings, and will even consume their own to become stronger.</p>\n<p>Tips for playing:</p>\n<ul><li>Always be moving, always be shooting, always be on the offensive. </li><li>Eliminate the Small Aliens before they can be consumed by the Green and Purple Spiders, who will gain health and IMMENSE SPEED upon eating smaller beings.</li><li>Use the obstacles left around the map to disrupt alien attacks, giving yourself time to get shots on target.</li><li>Whatever you do, don't let the Purple Spiders eat the Green Spiders. You will lose.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T06:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/6562b4f83f5d17293041f1a041eef6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AMIRABITO"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
