The <strong>twist </strong>is that the <strong>less</strong> bullets you have the <strong>more</strong> damage you can do. Also, the\u00a0<strong>less</strong> health you have the\u00a0<strong>more\u00a0</strong>speed you have.</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking my game out and hope you enjoy(ed) it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93a/93a9e7702e3ad9794f5b253e2021400c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kuz2103"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
