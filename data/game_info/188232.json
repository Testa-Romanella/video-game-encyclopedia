Its a shared keyboard 2 player game where one player uses WASD and the other uses the arrow keys. Your objective is to slam into the other player at high speeds to deal damage to them and knock them off the arena, similar to a super smash game. More damaged players will fly farther, and health packs occasionally spawn in which will restore lost health. Quick and fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec22cf81c21a6f3d6e1312b7a46661d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skelly1324"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
