UI button and UI layout page pixels have been changed using Paint software.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2- (Design Modification) New level 2 (aka Parkour Platform) has been created which has been carefully designed in such a way that the player can only make it through if it is skilled at platforming/parkour and if it manages to discover the hidden mechanic ( jumping while running makes you jump farther).</p>\n<p>3- (Creative story/design modification) New level 3 and level 4 have been created. Level 3 acts as a cutscene and provides information to the player that the tile art will now be used deceptively. This means that areas in level 4 which look like background might be foreground and vice-versa. The level 3 hints towards the lore that the player fell into a cosmic place that warps space and time to mess up the reality of the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T23:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d8c90294afbfd6da1af0d0918f2e999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ronnit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
