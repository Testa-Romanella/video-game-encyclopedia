Equipped with a portable radio station a little girl is sending waves to the universe. The loved dead ones (a.k.a. the stars in the sky) are responding with waves. Each star is a syllable of words in a message. The player now has to move the girl around and remix the sounds to hear the syllables of the words clearly and to rebuild the message. The game plays different in each language.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the \"Arrow keys\" on your keyboard to control the player. Hit \"Space\" to activate the transmission and listen carefully for the response of the stars. Try to guess the sentence and click on the stars in the right order to continue to the next level (click on \"I Hear You\" for submitting you guess).</p>\n<p>I Hear You is available to play in 7 different languages: English, German, French, Korean, Chinese Mandarin, Chinese Cantonese and Tagalog.</p>\n<p>Game developed during Global Game Jam 2018 on USC (Los Angeles) jam site by (alphabetic order):<br/></p>\n<p>Dario Ceblano @adorablecoin\r\n<br/>Po-Hsun Chen Facebook\r\n<br/>Soojung Choi @mageofmemories\r\n<br/>Stefanie Enge @StefanieEnge\r\n<br/>Rosanina Estrella @rosanina_e\r\n<br/>David Schornsheim @EscalatedSample\r\n<br/>Weibin Wu @seekereric\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>Poems by Emily Dickinson.\r\nStar Graphic Icon made by www.flaticon.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe102aa8e43fef7b5608f1a0d99fbc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Code Crowd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
