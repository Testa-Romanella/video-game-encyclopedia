We're happy that you're here. This is a demo of the action, platformer rpg that is currently in development by DLXXV Games, and will be available both here and on steam (without drm) in the spring of 2020.</p>\n<p>This demo shows the starting zones and gives you a good idea of what is in store for you in what comes next. Please feel free to comment on what you like and dislike. Things that could be improved and any other thoughts you might have.</p>\n<p>The story is subject to change in the official release, at least to some degree and new artwork for the character and npcs are currently in the works, but the game is 100% complete functionally and about 50% complete in game area and story.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again, what you get here is the tutorial (skippable at no detriment although I'd recommend it at least the first time you play), your starting village with some quests and the first dangerous zone you'll come across called The Dark. <br/></p>\n<p>If you like it, spread the word around. That's what we need most right now. If you feel like giving to help out with the cost of art, that's cool too. If you give at least $14.99 (the anticipated price) we'll make sure you get a copy of the full version at release (including a steam key if desired)</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to have a look! We hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>-Kelvin<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da053c032c19cb479dc2ad1062a794a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DLXXV"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
