One of the themes we were given was the town of Bockhampton, Berkshire that was enclosed in the 18th century and is now abandoned. to reflect the theme of enclosure I built a turn based strategy game were players need to think strategically and deceptively to enclose the largest areas by the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>[Instructions]<br/>node represent individual land holdings by enclosing them you take ownership of both and combine them into a larger estate. other players however can do the same thing to you so if you want to win you need to think strategically and consolidate your land before they do.</p>\n<p>turns: like chess each player gets alternating terns where they can make one move. both players use the same mouse so players will need to be situated somewhere all the players can reach the computer.</p>\n<p>moves: the player clicks two nodes to connect then, this is referred to as enclosure. the resulting enclosed area then belongs to the player and turns their colour. larger estates can also be enclosed with other estates around them or individual holdings.</p>\n<p>estates: nodes connected with white lines are an estate, while consisting of individual nodes they are treated as one whole.</p>\n<p>crown: nodes connected to the crow turn yellow and can no longer be enclosed by other players.</p>\n<p>end game: the game is over when there are no more unenclosed nodes left and the player with the most land is declared the winner.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T02:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b5339a26dab90ecbfcb67b958060dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TastyTentacles"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
