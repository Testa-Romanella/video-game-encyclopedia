Themes: Sky, Doughtnuts, and Warfare</p><p>This was my first game jam, so I spent a fairly long time figuring out something I\u00a0thought would be fun and humorous to fit the themes. I eventually went with a floating cloud (sky) who could rain down donuts upon people who were fighting or upset (which is my interpretation of\u00a0warfare). I hope folks enjoy it! It was a lot of fun to make :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc7727471d3208b4d48ffc5fd912679b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WeAreWalkingStardust"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
