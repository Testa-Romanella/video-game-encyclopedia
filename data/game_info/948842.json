{"id": 948842, "slug": "collage-zine-pack", "name": "Collage Zine Pack", "name_original": "Collage Zine Pack", "description": "<p>This is a pack of collage minizines I made on the theme of medicalisation. For each zine I repurposed something that to me represents the medicalisation of identity and the othering, gatekeeping, and strangeness of this experience. By cutting these documents up and collage with them I wanted to explore ways we self determine our own identities in a transphobic and ableist world, not letting our oppressors define us. I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Testogel a</strong>nd <strong>DSA Form </strong>were collaged onto white paper while <strong>Echocardiogram</strong> was collaged onto red paper, so be aware of this when printing. <br/></p>\n\r\nTestogel Leaflet zine \r\n<p>This was made using the information leaflet that comes with my testogel, the testogel box, print-outs from a trans poetry writing session, and the poem \"Conversation with Fantasy Mother\" by Mary Jean Chan. As HRT is aimed at cis people, the leaflet that comes with my testogel features nothing to do with trans people and is actively othering of us, assuming that the person taking the medication is a cis man with erectile dysfunction and a female partner. There's a whole line in it about how women shouldn't take testogel because they might grow a beard - yes I fucking hope so! I wanted to make something trans affirming out of this leaflet and explore the ways in which trans people have taken care of ourselves.</p>\r\n\u00a0DSA Form/Disability evidence Zine \r\n<p>This was made by me cutting up the disability evidence form my doctor had to fill out for my university to prove I was disabled enough to deserve support from them. The beurocracy of having to prove your disability is a difficult one to navigate, especially for undiagnosed people, so I wanted to destroy this symbol of that beurocracy. I also used lines from articles from an issue of National Trust Magazine about mushrooms. <br/></p>\r\nEchocardiogram Zine\r\n<p>This was made using a National Trust Magazine and letters from my doctor about echocardiogram appointments I've attended for my PoTs, and my own drawings of heart diagrams. I wanted to focus on my connection to my heart as something medicalised and as a part of my body, looking at how medical transphobia has impacted my experience of disability, but also how art can be a way to reconnect with yourself and reframe your experiences. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T12:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/508/5085d44ccc5f26b0172ae8a5a60d7f98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gender0Bender"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
