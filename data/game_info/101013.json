{"id": 101013, "slug": "deadlock-itch", "name": "Deadlock (itch)", "name_original": "Deadlock (itch)", "description": "<p>Deadlock is my entry for the 42nd LudumDare - a clever puzzle game in which you have to enable all red booleans to green. However you can move only if there is something on your axis - or X or Y. If after a movement, you are unable to move again - it's an impasse - you loose. You have only a little bit more than one minute to do the work. First levels explain the main gameplay. Many other tiles which use different behavior have been included so as to increase game difficulty - some reduce considerably your space, chasing player. You have to play with their (more or less) predictable behavior. Have fun ++</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Instructions :<br/></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Use arrows keys to move<br/></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>R key to restart level<br/></strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Escape to load menu<br/></strong></strong></p>\n<p>PS : Technically I would like to explain how I did this aesthetic. I didn't use any texture - all has been created simply using scripts which display pixels considering char strings. Now I am working on those scripts because I want to share them with community. However you have to wait a few days because I coded them quickly and I want to share something relevant - optimized. It was an interesting alternative ++ <br/></p>\n<p>PSbis : Finally code source is now available. I did some minor changes and all is clear. take a look at those scripts which explain you how to create sprites/textures using string ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbc5f4fe8829f40cf9d3d32dab6ffd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
