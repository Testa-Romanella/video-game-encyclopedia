{"id": 24997, "slug": "pokemon-trozei", "name": "Pok\u00e9mon Trozei", "name_original": "Pok\u00e9mon Trozei", "description": "<p>\n      Lucy Fleetfoot to the Rescue! \n    </p><p>\n      The storyline in Pok\u00e9mon Trozei is much deeper than you'd expect in a \n      puzzle game. The evil Phobos Battalion has been stealing countless Pok\u00e9 \n      Balls containing Pok\u00e9mon and carrying them to their secret bases using \n      machines called Phobos Mobiles. Playing as Lucy Fleetfoot, your mission \n      is to rescue the stolen Pok\u00e9mon from the Phobos Battalion.\n    </p><p>\n      To rescue Pok\u00e9mon, you'll need to use a gadget called the Trozei Beamer. \n      This device allows you to scan Pok\u00e9 Balls and then transfer the Pok\u00e9mon \n      inside to safety. An accurate lock is required for transfer, which means \n      that you have to line up Pok\u00e9 Balls containing identical Pok\u00e9mon in a \n      straight line.\n    </p><p>\n      To rescue all of the stolen Pok\u00e9mon, you'll have to battle your way \n      through a long series of increasingly challenging levels and boss \n      battles with Phobos Battalion generals.\n    </p><p>\n      Bottom Line \n    </p><p>\n      Pok\u00e9mon Trozei is a great new puzzle game. The Pok\u00e9mon flavor will \n      definitely appeal to Pok\u00e9mon fans, but even if you're not a Pok\u00e9mon \n      fanatic this game is worth checking out just for the great puzzle \n      action. The basic gameplay mechanics are easy to learn, but the longer \n      you play the more you realize that there is real depth beneath the \n      deceptively simple exterior. This is a must-play for any puzzle fan.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:25:41", "background_image": null, "website": "http://www.pokemontrozei.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
