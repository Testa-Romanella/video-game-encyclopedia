The idea behind the jam was to write a letter to Santa Claus asking for something you'd like in a game, then everyone gets a pair and receives two letters from other people, and it's up to you to conciliate those two themes into a game in 48 hours. The first letter we received asked for an unhealthy amount of codfish, while the second asked for frogs and birds.</p>\r\nDescription:\r\n<p>The game is an endless runner where you have to use each animal's natural abilities to dodge incoming obstacles and munch on your prey.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>Use your mouse to click the animal whose action you want to take:</p>\n<ul><li>The Codfish swims, allowing you to dodge obstacles above the water, such as buoys.</li><li>The Bird flies, allowing you to dodge lower obstacles, such as the rocks.</li><li>The Frog lets out its tongue, letting you eat various delicious prey, you only gain points by eating prey.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T10:51:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/6440ffb0fd3f3ebeb5676572523402e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Renas", "Nomig"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
