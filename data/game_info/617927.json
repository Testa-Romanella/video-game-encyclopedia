If Mast3r moves in one direction, Sl3ve will also move in the same direction. He takes advantage of the walls of the levels to create a way to reach the loading platform and move to the next level.</p>\n<p>But be careful!</p>\n<p>Sl3ve will not be able to survive or move if he is not at the right distance.</p>\n<p>Recover the energy of the system and complete this challenge in the shortest time possible. You will be able to upload your time in each level with a screenshot in the comments of our itch.io.</p>\n<p>Thank you for downloading our game and we hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Rebel Team members</p>\n<p>Angel Gonzalez</p>\n<p>Carlos Puche</p>\n<p>Javier Requena</p>\n<p>Regards and thank for playing it, The Rebel Team<br/><br/>PD: Special thanks to our collegue Joselvent Suarez, for give us support, love and mentoring with the rigging process!\u00a0</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Kenney.nl for the SFX of the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:35:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb2bdc0fad16b1e159161c8ea756eb85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan Puche"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
