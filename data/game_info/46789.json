We are trying out a concept to see if people would be interested in playing game like this in VR.<br/><br/>In the demo, you will be placed in a stadium like environment with an AI (early stage- concept). The aim is to steal the ball from the AI and score a goal against it to earn a point. 1 game lasts for 5 mins. At the end of 5mins, you can see if you managed to beat the AI or not.<br/><br/>In the future, we are looking at different gaming options for e.g. currently it\u2019s a solo game. We are looking at having 1 to 3 people in each team, Introducing Multi-Player, Trick Shots Modes and so on.<br/><br/>The controls are:<br/><strong>[RIGHT Controller]</strong><br/>To hit the ball, simply wave your controller and try to aim it in the direction you wish to hit the ball in.<br/><strong>[Left Controller]</strong><br/>Press the touch pad to move forward and point the controller in the direction you wish to go.
