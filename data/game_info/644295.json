You must get to her and stop her while avoiding her deadly bullets !<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- Arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p>Calamity Jane has a cyclical shooting pattern which will increase in difficulty each time you get to her. Try to get the highest score !</p>\n<p>This is my first game and my first game jam, it is nothing great but it is playable. I had a lot of ideas or have found a lot of bugs/janky movement mechanics but I didn't have time to implement them/fix them because I started the project very late (eg: sound effects). Still very fun to do and made me learn a lot about game dev, which was the reason I registered for the Jam in the first place.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits for assets/software used:</p>\n<p>- Player sprites: Pixeldudesmaker by 0x72 (https://0x72.itch.io/pixeldudesmaker)<br/></p>\n<p>- Menu background: Pixelator by ronenness (https://ronenness.itch.io/pixelator)</p>\n<p>- Tiles and Jane sprite : Generic OLDWEST Pack by Vaca Roxa (https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-oldwest-pack)</p>\n<p>- Font: Humble fonts by somepx (https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-free)</p>\n<p>- Music: Fastest Gun in the 8-Bit West by OkamiDeluxe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:29:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdff942bd5c5a7b12756e08e00bb556.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack_potta"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
