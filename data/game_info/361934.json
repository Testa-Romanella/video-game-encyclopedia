Fight back through waves of those you've damned to reclaim... your stuff.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Grim's Awakening is a procedurally generated top-down roguelike.</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made by me alone\u00a0in 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2019 based on the theme \"only one.\" My interpretation - a roguelike with only one \"bullet\" - your head!</p>\n\n<p>Because I made this in 48 hours and now I\u00a0need to go to bed, there are a few issues that I'd like to point out before you play so you can be aware.</p>\n<p>- The game has really funny balancing. The beginning is tough but once you pass the first 2 levels or so, you become insanely OP. Because your screenshake progresses with the strength of your skull, it's very fun :)</p>\n<p>- If you see an open doorway that leads to nothing... it's nothing. You can walk outside infinitely. Do it if you want.</p>\n<p>- If you progress far into the game, load times will get crazy. Sorry, again, I made this very fast so I had to be sloppy with the procgen. Luckily, if you do get stuck in an insane load time it'll be on the screen where it shows what level you've progressed to, so you can take a screenshot and show your friends that you're the best.</p>\n\n<p>Music and SFX attributions:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/win-sound-1</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/epic-amulet-item</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/dubious-dungeon</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/inner-core</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/open-chest<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2796eed2ad3c90b6968db17e2e7df1bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
