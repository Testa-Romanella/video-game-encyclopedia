I had a lot of fun building this and if interest is shown, I'd like to build a game around this concept with multiple characters, multiplayer and dungeons instead of arenas. Obviously, there would be loads of other features too. All donations would go to building out a full game. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>The main objective is to survive as long as possible while more and more skeletons spawn into the arena. You have limited mana, and your spells have cooldowns so try and manage them wisely. Find Mana-Pads to refill your mana and Health-Pads to refill your health. Spells and Controls listed below.</p>\n<p>The desktop versions are what I consider the complete versions of the game (as the web version has High Score Tracking, FXAA and SSAO all turned off.)</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Shift - Sprint</li><li>E - Fire Rune</li><li>Right Click - Fire Stream</li><li>Left Click - Fire Ball</li><li>Escape - Restart</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I am the sole developer of this game though I did use some sounds from a sound pack I got years ago.</p>\r\nSome Stats\r\n<p>This game was built in the evenings during the course of the two weeks really just when I had time. The code and game itself are kept in a git repo which now has 128 commits and uses 568mb of storage. I also ran continuous\u00a0integration on all 4 platforms which created 144 builds, 11 of which failed (usually due to bugs in the CI itself. Each build took an average of 35 minutes. If anyone has questions about how that\u00a0was setup, please let me know.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e4c8fb9c4aaba3b6b0951fdf441b173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TylerC"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
