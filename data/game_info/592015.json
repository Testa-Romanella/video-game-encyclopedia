It only has two maps and I am really sorry about this but I can't put too many maps in the game as it will ruin the game because the game it's self will only have 15 to 10 maps! Anyways thanks for playing and have fun! Also check the prototype version if you want more play time :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bc6ed42ec8352a02576fea5d3a18bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TOOTB Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
