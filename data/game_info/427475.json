{"id": 427475, "slug": "drag-2", "name": "DRAG", "name_original": "DRAG", "description": "<p>DRAG introduces a new kind of vehicle-physics. Have you ever noticed how cars in many racing games pivot around their center? With our 4CPT-technology and soft-body tire model we simulate every component of the vehicles in real time, down to the grab-mass of the tire profile. Resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior. Driving fast on loose surface without driving aids is exciting, challenging and ultimately hard to master. The driving feel is pure.<br />\nDRAG combines arcade style racing with vibrant driving mechanics.<br />\nEven though DRAG is not a simple arcade racer, it&#39;s designed to be played with a gamepad or keyboard. Support for racing wheels will be added in Early Access.<br />\n24 Singleplayer challenges<br />\nMultiplayer wheel-to-wheel racing in online or split screen matches<br />\nHow does it work?<br />\nYou can follow faster players by utilizing slipstream, hence the name of the game &#39;DRAG&#39;.<br />\nIf you follow your opponents closely you will also gain boost which is at your disposal for overtaking, but should be used carefully and strategically. However if you get too close and ram another vehicle your car will take permanent damage.<br />\nAlso there&#39;s no respawn in online matches, we call it the out-is-out principle, so if you like to push your opponents off track you better be strategical about that as well. You might end up with a wheel or two missing - which by the way shouldn&#39;t keep you from battling on. Three wheels is plenty ;)<br />\nWe don&#39;t believe in stupid time penalties. Play as dirty as you like, brake check if someone is following in your slipstream. But be prepared to end up in a tree upside down if things go wrong.<br />\nTo stay out of trouble or In case you can&#39;t pass someone without risk of damage, use the jokerlap. That&#39;s a longer route which everyone has to take at least once a race. If you have not taken the joker until the final lap the regular path will be blocked for you.<br />\nThe jokerlap is another strategic element you can use to your advantage. If you are leading the race but you don&#39;t want to give others slipstream you can take the joker but you might end up between other cars. So it&#39;s good to know how much time the joker will cost you on each map. There are live gap-times displayed for all drivers so you can judge when it&#39;s best to take the joker.<br />\nDRAG combines action packed racing with deep and challenging driving dynamics.<br />\nGet involved in the development process and join our Discord:<br />\nhttps://discord.gg/hUDxpnN</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T11:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d98/d98a8a2b0591bb7b728c5f2ead3b264d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 12, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orontes Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Orontes Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
