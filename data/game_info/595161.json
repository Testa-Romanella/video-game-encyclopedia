Hold SHIFT while moving to enter blocks. Press U or Z to undo a move.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T12:40:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b664be41ea116c5908660a861fcf0bcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mithrilnova", "e-neighborhood-watch"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
