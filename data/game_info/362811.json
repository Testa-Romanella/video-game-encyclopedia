But no one could also prove that \"the past\" is real. It's possible that I just \"existed\" now, and my memories were just fabricated.<br/><br/>This is me right now, lost, confused, and don't know where to go. Maybe I was just being born last night, but somehow, \"my past\" still haunted me. I can't remember it, but they said I am the one responsible who dropped the helicopter.<br/><br/>Fuck! If only I could remember something. I can't even remember my own name. But why?! Even though I can't remember my own name, but I can remember the one who made me like this?!<br/><br/>It's not only that....I'm not even sure if I'm a human being. Not after what happened today. I can stop the rain. No, it's not like I can change rain to sunny weather...I make thousand droplets of rain stop falling, hanging it in the air like defying the gravitation around me. <br/><br/>.... Far from the bottom of my heart, I'm sure that I have to end all of this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>My name is --------------, let me tell you my story.<br/><br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<h3>DETAILS</h3><ul>Genre : Action, Psychological, Sci-fi</ul><ul>Length : 60k Words (divided into 6 Chapters)</ul><ul>Language : English</ul><h3>TEAM</h3><ul>Original story : fsc</ul><ul>Adaptation : TNR </ul><ul>Proofreader : kiv (Ch.1), S.B Hunter (Ch.2 and 3), David Pardy (Ch.3)</ul><br/>Made With <strong>Ren'py Visual Novel Engine</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d266b2be7ee11f9fb6db9d0f8c823a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 8, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NSAID"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NSAID"], "esrb_rating": null}
