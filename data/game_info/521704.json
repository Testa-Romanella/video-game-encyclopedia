This is a piece of a dream, and even if it is packed in machine code, it is not a game<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project pays tribute to the post-Soviet culture and captures the memories of our generation, for us in the future, giving an opportunity to plunge into the past.

Lie on a bed immersively, sit at the table. Listen to the sound of wheels. Hear drunk men singing, people talking and snoring.<br/><br/>-Just hide in a virtual blanket and look out the window at the falling snow and beautiful winter landscapes. Drink some tea while listening to post-hardcore, and just immerse into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>-Learn what's like in russian trains<br/><br/>-Beautiful graphics<br/><br/>-First person view<br/><br/>-Supports VR<br/><br/>-Gamepad support<br/><br/>-Achievements", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T02:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/01277d05c038d7089d814cfc1b399ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u042f-\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0443\u0443\u0443", "\u041f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430, \u0442\u044b, \u0435, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kavkaz Sila Games", "\u0411\u043e\u0433"], "esrb_rating": null}
