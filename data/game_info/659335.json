Working on this project was a ton of fun and was kind of hard to stop, <em>buuuut</em> I had to at some point.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Explore Wickford castle in real 3D, including the upstairs hallways, the main lobby, Nancy's room, and the fireplace room</li><li>Watch a \"cinematic\" version of\u00a0the game intro with the letter and photos. (And by cinematic I mean the camera moves)</li><li>Pick up and examine all sides of items in the environment</li><li>Zoom in with your magnifying glass!</li><li>Open your suitcase, drawers, and doors.\u00a0 And pick up and read pamphlets and books</li><li>Take inventory items and equip them when necessary. Like when \"It's Locked!\"</li></ul>\n<p>Since I'm new to the programming side of game dev, unfortunately I can't guarantee a completely bug-free experience.\u00a0 I'd recommend having a graphics card comparable to the Nvidia GTX 750 or better to not drop frames.\u00a0 But hey, at least it's free so even if you have an older computer it's worth a try!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game, and you end up feeling just as nostalgic as I do!</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e4915b395a9f9cca7a675b8e08634939.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julia Holdnack"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
