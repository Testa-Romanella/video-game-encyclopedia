If you go to download the game, you'll see two options to choose from. \"v4\" was the version that was submitted (scarily close) before the deadline. The jam host, however, said it's ok to submit any game breaking bug fixes, or any pressing last minute changes. \"v6\" is the new and improved (but...certainly not totally polished) version. I understand that in the spirit of the game jam, <strong>if you were to rate my game, please consider the \"v4\" version -- that was our official entry and we're sticking by it!</strong> :) Versions 6 and onward are basically for my own peace of mind, I just really want to finalize all that was there. Super thankful to Luke Herbert, the jam host, for letting us be able to make these quick changes. <strong>Again, for any official ratings, please consider the v4 version, NOT the v6 version!</strong> Thanks so much for stopping by and playing our game. Daniel especially really knocked the environments outta the park. <br/></p>\n<p>Take care!</p>\n<p>-Zucchini<br/></p>\n<p><em>Quick Update: </em>Replaced v6 with v7. V7 addresses issues with the inside mech controls giving people (understandable) motion sickness, and I also added some more sounds. The death button restarts the level, so you don't have to sit through the cutscene each time you play. Will add more, slowly but surely! Thanks again for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b0666aa18e1ef0268102af049f836d45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zucchini3D"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
