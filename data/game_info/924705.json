To proceed in the journey involves a quest for a portal between one tale and the next. Certain moments offer a pause and the opportunity to explore archival findings and historical backdrops often linking these two seemingly disparate nations that were closely tied to one another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game, much like any book, is not meant to be consumed in one sitting and can be revisited with all progress saved for the next time round.</p>\n<p>Research, Script, Animation\u00a0and\u00a0Art: Afrah Shafiq<br/>Lead Programmer: Kushal Neil<br/>Lead Animator: Piyush Verma<br/>Additional Animation: Eeshani Mitra<br/>Original Score and Music Production: Rushad Mistry and Zohran Miranda<br/>Sound Design and\u00a0Game\u00a0Audio Implementation: Horacio Valdiveso<br/>Project curators: Iaroslav Volovod and Valentin Diaconov<br/>Garage Field Research team: Oxana\u00a0Polyakova, Daria Bobrenko and Ivan Yarygin<br/><br/>This project was created with the support of the Garage Field Research program of Garage Museum of Contemporary Art (Moscow) for the Garage Digital platform.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T17:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/81796fc998f2f5fef8953368d14c0479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["loveandotheroutdoorgames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
