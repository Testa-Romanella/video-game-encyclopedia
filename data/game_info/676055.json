Embark on an epic fight against armies of pens, paint tubes and paper balls on fire, all trying to destroy your little toons.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>As you get shot by your enemies, you\u2019ll develop new abilities that you can use to defeat your opponents. But beware ! the more shots you\u2019ll take, the more unstable you\u2019ll become, until you explode !! Kaboom !!!\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Copy the attacks of your enemy as you get shot by them !\r\n</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Switch between three types of movements and attacks :\u00a0\r\n</strong></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Throw ink to protect yourself against incoming invaders.\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>Shoot lasers when covered with paint and slide swiftly across the sheet of paper.\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>Throw yourself at your enemies when you\u2019re on fire, but at the cost of your mobility.\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>Watch out for the stability bar ! The more you get shot by one type of enemy, the more it will build up ! If you reach the end of it on either side, you\u2019ll blow up and lose a life !\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Keep moving and fight against successive waves of enemies coming from everywhere. As you get shot by one type of enemy, you\u2019ll slowly build your instability bar either left or right, and acquire new types of movements and attack patterns, depending on which enemy shot you.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When the instability bar reaches its maximum either way, you\u2019ll blow up and lose one of your three lives. When you lose all three lives, it\u2019s game over. Try to shoot as many enemies as possible to raise your score number, and keep an eye on your instability bar.\u00a0\r\n</strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Keyboard :<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Use the arrows keys or ZQSD/WASD keys to move.</strong></li><li><strong>Use the space bar to shoot.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Producers : Alexandre Gorin | K\u00e9vin I</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Artists : Amandine Rul (Portfolio)\u00a0| Kimberley Prunier\u00a0(Portfolio)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Designers : David Fernand | Rafa\u00ebl De Oliveira Reis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Programmers : David Du | L\u00e9o Nimsgern | Nolan Jutard</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sounds :<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Silly Intro by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/free-music/ Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\u00a0\r\n</strong></li><li><strong>https://www.chosic.com/download-audio/24336/\r\n</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Font :\u00a0https://mixfonts.com/downloads/mix-doodle/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Install instructions :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 : Extract the folder</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 : Open the extracted folder</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 : Launch Ludum</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 : Click on \"Play\"</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/681342075cfc9ab5462bb9a5f554cdd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laefar", "Makiro", "Nolan Jutard", "Kimberley Prunier", "L\u00e9o Nimsgern", "Loukho", "Nietmans", "Oikein", "Dadu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
