He now must find the culprit behind his missing bell and get it back, but is cursed with bad luck!</p>\n<p>In this 2D Platformer, players control the sweet and friendly Bo, solving puzzles and interacting with other animals throughout the game to find the missing cowbell, and Taro the bull who took it...</p>\n<p>As the story unfolds, Bo will learn the importance of forgiveness, as well as treasuring friends over objects.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is currently a Demo, as many issues were experienced during it's creation. All of the original build was lost, and the game had to be rebuilt far into the process. Because of this, it was cut down from two full levels to a single demo level that shows some of the original mechanics.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Roadmap:</p>\n\n<p>Character Assets:</p>\n\n\n<p>Dev Team Beakdown:</p>\n\n<p>Caide Hickman was the main artist during the creation of Bo's Bell: The Demo! He worked on a majority of the assets, from Bo's animation to the background to the platforms! He also performed basic support for the Game Builder, and came up with the basic idea for Bo's Bell.</p>\n\n<p>Andi Sullivan was the Game Builder. She designed the layout for the demo level, worked on fixing bugs as they popped up, and she did the art for the Duck side character! She continuously worked to make sure the game would run as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<p>Technology Used to Make Bo's Bell:</p>\n<p>This demo was built in Unity, and used the help of the 2D Game Kit.</p>\n<p>All the art was created in either Adobe\u00a0Photoshop CC 2019, or in Procreate for the iPad.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/52616d16b5b26d99936f18b282a16aa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caide"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
