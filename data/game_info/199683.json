You'd think Australia would be a better country with him at the reigns, no?</p><p>Sadly, if you thought so, you're wrong. Over the last few years, he's made dumb moves, silly comments and loves to stir up Australian Politics. Now you can give him a piece of your mind and take out your revenge on him!</p><p>Each whack of his head earns you a point. You've got 60 seconds to whack as many Abbott heads as you can. <strong><em>Have you got what it takes to beat our best score of 110 whacks?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>IMPORTANT NOTE: This game is a joke, and only for amusement purposes.
