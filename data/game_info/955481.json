The game is about an hour long and is hopefully quite enjoyable. The premise is monsters have invaded William's manor and he has to figure out how to get rid of them.</p>\n<p>Since it's done with Bolt (Visual Scripting 1.6.1 to be precise) and me being shit at programming, there are some shortcomings:</p>\n<ul><li>I've no idea how to do rebindable controls with Bolt, not sure if it's even possible. So I made a bunch keys accessible, both for keyboard and gamepad (there's a list in-game)</li><li>No graphic options, since it's a not easy even in C#. I tested it on a monitor with no g-sync, there were no screen tearing. And resolution should be native. You can also go windowed with alt-enter. </li><li>At least there's are separate audio sliders.</li><li>Bolt is overall slower than proper code, so there may be slowdowns on older systems.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>\u00a0(for more detailed credits check https://pastebin.com/xUgcpJ7r or Credits.txt in the game folder):</p><ul><li>Programing, design, story, occasional assets editing - me (GrimCookie)</li><li>https://www.youtube.com/@Megahertzs/videos - Tutorials</li><li>https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero</li><li>https://szadiart.itch.io/</li><li>https://luizmelo.itch.io/</li><li>https://itch.io/c/313331/gothicvania</li><li>https://lil-cthulhu.itch.io/coin</li><li>https://svl.itch.io/</li><li>https://devtrap.itch.io/fears</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/no-more-magic</li><li>https://digitalwytch.itch.io/</li><li>https://incompetech.com/</li><li>https://99sounds.gumroad.com/l/99sounds-thunder</li><li>https://www.fontspace.com/connection-ii-font-f31971</li><li>https://www.dafont.com/october-crow.font</li><li>https://www.fontspace.com/pixelbroidery-font-f29507</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T15:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a10/a10ee6108f550514ae88ea2c82d98700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrGrimCookie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
