{"id": 791558, "slug": "a-dark-room-itch-sergeant_slash", "name": "A Dark Room (itch) (Sergeant_Slash)", "name_original": "A Dark Room (itch) (Sergeant_Slash)", "description": "<p>You wake up in a dark room.</p>\n<p>All you have at your disposal is a flashlight with a rapidly dwindling battery, and your puzzle solving ability. \u00a0Each time you awake in the dark you have 60 seconds to explore as much as you can before your light extinguishes again. Can you piece together the puzzle and escape? Or will you forever reawaken in the dark?</p>\n<p>This game is a submission for Black and White Jam #8, it's my first game jam submission and done solo (against arguably better judgment haha). I'm an engineer with a CS degree and no background in the art side of things beyond a bit of pixel art, so I challenged myself to do everything from scratch. I wrote all the code, made all the sprites, built and textured all the models, wrote the music, and even recorded my own sound effects. Expect a bit of... programmer art quality in places, but I'm honestly pretty darn happy with what I managed to put together considering I had never done many of the things I had to do for this (not to mention I started 8 days into the 12 day timeline XD).<br/></p><p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Alec<br/></p><p><em>Note: The browser version is a slightly upgraded version I finished off in the days following the Jam. I started late and I had really wanted to integrate a mapping system, which turned out to be the most requested feature in the Jam ratings. So I have added a map and compass. I highly recommend sticking to this version, but if you do wish to see the original, there is a download of the Jam submission still available.</em></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T18:01:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/287753dd3e1c48cad0b11bba3779111d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sergeant_Slash"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
