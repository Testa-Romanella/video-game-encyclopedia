Some coins are on the ground, some are under the terrain and have to be dugout. The game has also a local PvP game mode.<br/>The playable characters are cute kitties. Males deal more damage but are a bit slower, females deal less damage but are quicker and jump a bit higher. There are also power-ups in the boxes placed in the game arena.<br/><br/>Have fun with destroying the game environment and beating your high scores!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T09:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0cadf24f09772931ce5f0f0d27572bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aasura Project"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
