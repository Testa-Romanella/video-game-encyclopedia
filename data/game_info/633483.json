Here, you\u2019re the leader of the Zoonks, an alien race concerned about the well-being of all life on Earth. Your goal is simple: to rescue as many animals as you can, keeping them safe in your Space Zoo, a place with no fences or cages, much like a safari, just way cooler for both the visitors and the cute residents. Take care of them, by cleaning their habitats, petting them, and merging every 5 animals of the same species into a new, rarer and crazier version. And, of course, have tons of fun with the many crazy, fun random events occuring while you take care of everything alongside your trusty manager! There are more than 60 animal species for you to collect, and many minigames to dominate while you rescue them all!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/6866ae1270b39c5cb3370f4b41becec1_dFKXGfU.jpg", "website": "https://www.dreamsondemand.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dreams on Demand"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["GMK Negocios e Participacoes Ltda"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
