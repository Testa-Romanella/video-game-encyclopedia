In this game the player controls the rotation of the stage instead of the ball itself. The first level gives the player an area to get used to the controls. After that the player must navigate mazes and other obstacles to move on. The last level is a narrow path that requires way too much control. There is also some projectiles that the player must avoid.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T13:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0ebd8aeac7fe7e270e54a2698e3f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["theeb12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
