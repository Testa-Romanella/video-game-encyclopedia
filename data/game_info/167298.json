The next step is to find a way to signal ships and aircraft that you are at sea, which is where the transmission theme comes to play.</p>\n<p>The experience is tailored for the HTC Vive VR set and will only work on systems that support SteamVR with controllers. This is also a standing up experience as you are able to move around the raft.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>The thumb button on the Vive controller grabs the object and trigger uses it (flashlight).<br/>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>THE RAFT created by:</strong>\n<br/>Penjami Forsberg<br/>Sebastian Laitila<br/>Mikko Niemikorpi<br/>Miika Pietil\u00e4<br/>Anton Rautanen<br/>Petri Saranen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82a/82a21957398917c29605a6d8aeb96c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aarreentertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
