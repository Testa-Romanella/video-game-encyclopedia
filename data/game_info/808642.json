Along a puzzle and\u00a0amazing music by talented Rafael Garaj\u00a0( Go check him! ) you will have rich experience.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>All assets were made by using\u00a0Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and were animated in Unity engine. But i also use some textures i took picture of or my sketches as paintings on the wall.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>My inspirations\u00a0would be games from Amanita Design, Night in the Woods or Mutazione.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Game was made as my term project on\u00a0Gameart.\u00a0I was learning everything during a process. That means from a early prototypes and ideas (that were changing a lot during whole process) to numerous\u00a0obstacles during development. And finally\u00a0typing these words presenting my truly first video\u00a0game i have ever made!</p>\n\n<p>I'm grateful what i have learned and excited about future projects or\u00a0possibility to\u00a0add some more stuff or even story extensions for Chroma!
