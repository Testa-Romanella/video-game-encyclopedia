Users can create amazing 3D models, scenes, and art work in a fun and intuitive way! For years 3D design tools have been difficult to learn and a nightmare to use. The Gravity sketch user experience makes sense for EVERYONE, in turn lowering the barriers to 3D literacy. You can take your models out of the scene and import them directly into a game or another 3D creation tool. You can also upload your creations directly from the app to SketchFab to share with others in a matter of seconds.
