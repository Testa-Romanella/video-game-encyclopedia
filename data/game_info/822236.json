I am quite new to game development with Unity, so that explains some of my questionable decisions. I do have more experience programming, so that is why I chose to create a game of this type. I thought that because most of the interaction is done in code and not in the engine that it would be easier (I was wrong, it was a lot of work). Ultimately, I am quite happy with the end product, despite some issues which I will note below. If you would like to hear a more complete chronicle of my experience, I will (hopefully) be creating a devlog soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Things I Dislike</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The UI elements are blurry because I placed the UI elements via world space</li><li>The aspect ratio is weird (Its 50:15, its a long story)</li><li>I feel as if the game is not super fun</li><li>I feel as if I implemented the sound poorly</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things I Like</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I was able to develop a complete and finished, albeit rough, game</li><li>I really like the way the characters die, its really satisfying to me to have them fly off the screen like that</li><li>I was able to implement features that I previously had limited knowledge of (animations, tile sheets, etc.)</li></ul>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Code and Design: HAD29</li><li>Art: Kenny</li><li>Music:\u00a0\"Ancient Rite\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0SFX: artisticdude</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading and playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:40:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/473a684dd9e4625b179cd355f8638510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HAD29"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
