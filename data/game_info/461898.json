It's Pong. That's it. Pong with fancier graphics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll have to ask you to do some imagination work here. Envision me. In my normal, human form.\u00a0I'm begging you, i'm on my knees, knees on the floor, weeping like a baby, imploring you to play this game, because i don't know what else could entice you to play it if not the fact that playing it will get me to stop crying. It's that bad. This was a full week, well more like 6 days, of hard work. At least 1 hour a day everyday. Sometimes 2. I put my soul in this. Please play it, so i can stop crying.</p>\n<p>That's it? Done? Done with your imagination work? Imagined me doing all those things? Ok, will you play the game now? Will you?\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:36:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c817b421f1b33cdb0500f5e3c2d9d347.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuskadamo"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
