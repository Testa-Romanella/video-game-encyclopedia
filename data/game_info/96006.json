Great work on locating Orion. You reported that his optics and motor timgears are non-functional - However the pilot is alive and can still move ORION - So we have adjusted your mission objectives. Your mission is now bring ORION back home. I understand ORION can't see via the optics; But you mentioned you're streaming your systems to him via the T.I.M system? That's smart thinking, Cedalion. Great work. Now... Go and bring him home! </p><p>&lt;<end msg=\"\">&gt;</end></p><p>ORION S.R.S is a 3D multiplayer-only action game developed by WindowsYesEdtior in 7 days for the Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4 Epic Megajam.
