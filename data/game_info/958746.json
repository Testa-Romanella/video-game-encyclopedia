Beat 15 levels to get as many points as possible.</p>\n<p>Supports Keyboard and Controller:<br/>Move: Arrow Keys / D-Pad / Left-Stick<br/>Fire: Spacebar / xBox (A)<br/>Menu: Z / Start to see more controls.<br/><br/>Reset Hi-Scores by entering\u00a0your name as: \"RESET123\"<br/><br/>Story time: This game is made with Godot and is\u00a0my first\u00a0(finished) computer game, and my first breakthrough in learning a game engine (I tried learning Unity years ago but failed). I\u00a0do have more than a decade of experience in doing physical and chemical modelling and data analysis in Matlab, but that is something quite different.<br/> I wanted to make a game with a scope I could finish. So my choice was to make a game with simple assets with a well established game play loop, as\u00a0I\u00a0wanted to focus on learning how to structure/refactor\u00a0the game code, and do subsequent polishing so the game\u00a0actually feel/look/sound good. Last but not least, I\u00a0wanted\u00a0export the game with all the hassles that it entails.</p>\n<p>Leave me a message if you want support for Mobile controller scheme. I kind of want to implement that, but I also fully\u00a0expect it will be a huge hassle\u00a0haha.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T20:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/717c9548333254e232a69319c06f7c53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bLARSt Zone Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
