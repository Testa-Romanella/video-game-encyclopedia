Visual identity of the game takes inspiration in structuralist games, like tetris.\u00a0 Main objective is to paint as many structures as possible before you lose all your stamina to get a highscore. Core mechanics are jumping, your turbo power and paint (if you do right, you win stamina and score).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T02:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d67588496106149734f52f57c79c6943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WaffcakE"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
