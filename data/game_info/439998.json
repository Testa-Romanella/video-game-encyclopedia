Get to know all the employees in this small family grocery store, think about life, and eat a really good sandwich. I made this game based off a true family grocery store that is very important to me. It is owned by some very close friends, and was also my first job. I hope players can feel a little bit of what makes this place special.</p>\n\n<p>Music credits:</p>\n<p>-Free Nationals, Gidget</p>\n<p>- Sounds for the Supermarket 5 (1975)</p>\n<p>-Nana Theme, Holland Patent Public Library</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/373622191d6d263cb6b41b5b5a40b5d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J-mo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
