I am a big fan of the fantasy RPG genre - magic especially - and something I've always wanted to do in a game is to actually create my own magic and feel like a true wizard! I also dislike the fact that there are usually not many armours that have the stats I want, and that look good. So I decided to create my own game where the player can do so much more than any other game character can.</p>\n<p>This is currently only really a proof of concept, that includes basic spell programming, simple terrain generation, and an annoying enemy AI (pro tip: you want a projectile speed of at least 50 units per second).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, since there is no tutorial, you have to read a longer-than-I-would-have-liked player guide in order to fully explore everything this release has to offer.</p>\n<p>Also, a word of warning, this is not a very user-friendly experience.</p>\n\n<p>This is the only gameplay footage I have, it shows the development process to an extent.</p>\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c4fdf442ccf40f40c5ad8ca0d85fa9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZjamberEaber"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
