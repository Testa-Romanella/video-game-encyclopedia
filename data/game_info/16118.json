The story is set in the near future in the world of giant mechs and the rise of technology. The plot tells about the confrontation of three forces: the United Earth Federation, the Illuminate and the Cybrans. They united in the first game but the newly elected President&#39;s assassination makes them break up.</p>\n<p>The game is split into three missions dedicated to these forces. You have an opportunity to play as each side of the conflict that allows you to see it at different angles. At the end three separated campaigns come together and have the single ending.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is typical for the RTS genre: you need to build facilities, mine resources and create an army of different military forces, including robots, tanks and super weapons. Your units are upgradeable with special points you can get developing technologies and defeating enemies. The goal of the game is to overcome your opponents. However, in a single-player campaign you can win by the numerical superiority of your army.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2010-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T22:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5db/5db33e1b461c60cdbfe48a5f4837101d.jpg", "website": "http://www.supremecommander.com/", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 106, "owned": 1981, "beaten": 63, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 66, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 92, "ratings_count": 156, "suggestions_count": 648, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 156, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Gas Powered Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Square Enix"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
