For example, in the second level, the jumper is affected by a debuff, which affects the movement speed and jump distance and height of the jumper. In the third level, we planned to have the camera invert and have the user complete the stage upside-down, a metaphor for one's world being turned on it's head. Along the way, we planned to have friends and family provide words of encouragement -- in our long term vision this interaction plays a crucial role in actually climbing the tower.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:59:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/382/382de3c7ed19321832e714df8ae4060d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["efazmuh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
