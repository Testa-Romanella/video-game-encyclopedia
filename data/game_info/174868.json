See how many times you can bounce the ball on your head without it hitting the ground. Or see how high you can get it. The choice is yours because this is a videogame and you have agency, wow!</p><p>You can also bounce the ball off your cool pigeon body but you don't get any points. You can't bounce the ball off your neck because pigeon necks are really weak.</p><p>Left and right arrows to move. Space to stretch ya neck. Esc to esc. </p><p>I haven't tested the Windows build so let me know if it doesn't work.<br/></p><p><strong>Update 1.1: </strong>Fixed scoring glitch where score went up by more than one some times. High scores now permanent between play sessions.<br/></p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee then any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #1 or 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/046df2fba959e3e754832c666ec403de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
