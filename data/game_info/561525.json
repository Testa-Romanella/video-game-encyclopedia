If you've played the tutorial and play the main game, you'll take 5-10 minutes to finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer's own perspective on the game:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's a huge improvement to my last game on itch.io, but there's definetly room to improve. I was glad to have a modeller (https://itch.io/profile/srce420) for this since it wouldn't have nearly looked as appealing as this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope for some feedback so I can learn for the next jam!</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Some glitches</li><li>Missing animations (shouldn't affect the progress of the player)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:38:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/611c522718dfe31c012b7635c2789179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FortySix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
