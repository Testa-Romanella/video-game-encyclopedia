Convince yourself in a card game battle with dopamine, psychology and excuses that you will find while slaying mages. But remember, the deadline is inevitable...<br/><br/>Controls are simple: WASD to move, left-click to attack, and LeftShift to dash.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had tonnes of fun making this game during Ludum Dare 50, and I\u00a0also learned a lot (I\u00a0started with game Dev about a month ago). I really like the concept however I\u00a0think that the game is very unbalanced at the moment (sometimes RNG just destroys you, sometimes there is no challenge). I\u00a0might work on this some more and make an actual small game out of it.<br/></p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated!<br/><br/>All coding and art by me<br/>Sound effects generated by\u00a0jsfxr - 8 bit sound maker and online sfx generator.<br/></p>\n<p>Sound tracks used:\u00a0<br/>RED Productions\u00a0Synthwave Vintage Future Synth 80s Retro Game Futuristic Music | Royalty Free Music - Pixabay\u00a0<br/>VitalSource - Beyond the Mind\u00a0https://tunetank.com/track/3850-beyond-the-mind</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a06/a0612c012cc589474cdbecdeee9fa818.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["haastregt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
