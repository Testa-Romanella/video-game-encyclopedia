Along the way you can come across power-ups and special path pieces that can help you reach the end first or sent you flying straight off the track.<br/>With the added Character Customization and Section Creator, you can customize your experience even more!<br/><br/>Rumble Runners is now in Early Access, expected a wider release near the end of 2021.<h3>Section Creator</h3>Each random generated track uses \"Sections\" to build with. With the Section Creator you can build your own Sections and setup special behaviors for the path pieces in it!<br/>To ensure every player can reach the end, there are some limitations in place. This way, there is less of a chance a naughty Host will make it harder for the other Party Members to reach the end and secure a cheap victory for themselves!<h3>Randomly Generating Race Tracks</h3>Each and every match is completely randomly generated. Every power-up is randomly spawned in the same manner, making each and every time you play a new round a new experience! Even the Host doesn't have total control over how the Track is being generated, which ensures that every player has a disadvantage.<br/>With the RNG aspect to this mechanic, everyone has to rely on their skill, reflexes and their luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T02:38:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c62/c623390ca76e92f1645fb132a824a2a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunatinc"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lunatinc"], "esrb_rating": null}
