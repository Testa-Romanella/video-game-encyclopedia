You can use it to magnetize rocks causing them to be  pulled together or pushed apart. You objective is to destroy all  enemies by crushing them between rocks and not get killed.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is unstable because its difficult to properly place enemy between rocks to kill it. You cannot directly kill enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>This  is a bit unfinished game, we should tweak a lot more. There are  multiple hacks and other problems. However the core idea is working, so\u2026  :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:49:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16bd25c9a56ef1ead1b3420bba1e4d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["piwaniuk", "hatmajster"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
