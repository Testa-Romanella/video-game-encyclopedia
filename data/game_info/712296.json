I could complete the game (which looped back to the start - but next loop it was all a bit faster) 3 times around! Playing it now, on an emulator with my middle age brain it was just SO DAMN HARD! couldnt get anywhere! but it made me want to play it, in a more modern setting, BUT, with the old style graphics and sounds.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0remade all the graphics pixel by pixel from screenshots of the original game, some of the tiles from the original needed altering, and I\u00a0had to add some new ones for what I\u00a0wanted them to do.</p>\n<p>Screen can be 1x 2x 4x or fullscreen, yes 1x is 320x240!</p>\n<p>Colours can be altered like the orginal, I'll let you find out its glorious!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>PC - WASD for movement, R. Shift for 'Murder' and Space to jump.</p>\n<p>JOYSTICK also works Left Stick or D-Pad for movement Triggers for 'Murder'</p>\n<p>and A to jump.</p>\n<p>ANDROID - game has onscreen controls and touch works where mouse does on PC</p>\n<p>(Not yet released - but exactly as PC though screen is autosized)</p>\n<p>I know it sets a key for 'hold' but that was from the original define keys page of the original game, so I kept it, but havnt implemented it!</p>\n<p>Game now has more modern mechanics, you can double jump, there are achievements and unlocks too.\u00a0 Crazy how much you see the changes that game have gone through when you play something from such a time ago, but I didnt want to loose that feel too much, I\u00a0hope I found the right balance!</p>\n<p>You can jump higher from a crouch (which can be a sliding crouch)</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have credited and linked to the original game and the amazing musician that is Martin Galway for the muscial score, and FX that this game has. as well as to Johnathan Smith, the original programmer, the only link I\u00a0could find to him was his YouTube channel though, so go say hello!</p>\n<p>TODO:</p>\n<p>LittleLennie Link button - done</p>\n<p>Build all the levels -\u00a0 3 and nightslasher done. - 9 to go!</p>\n<p>2 Missing About page unlocks - done one of them</p>\n<p>More Achievements</p>\n<p>Additional platformer mechanics</p>\n<p>Dedication\u00a0 to Joffa Smifff\u00a0 - done</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f98eab6bb0ac4f45ddb839f52a8be0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["AllegroMk2"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
