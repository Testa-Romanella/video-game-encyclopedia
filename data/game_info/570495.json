MULTIPLAYER! (windows version)</p>\n<p><strong>If the \"PLAY!\" option does not work... use the \"Play solo / Training\" for speedrunning. Why? Keep reading...</strong><br/></p>\n<p>THEME: SIDE-EFFECTS: The side-effect of running too much is getting tired ;) This is obvious on the real world but not quiet common in a running game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: Keyboard, pad or touchscreen (html5 on cellphone or\u00a0when the handheld version be available)</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;left&gt;, &lt;left trigger&gt;, &lt;tap on the left side&gt;</strong>: Runs left<br/><strong>&lt;right&gt;, &lt;right trigger&gt;, &lt;tap on the right side&gt;</strong>: Runs right</p>\n<p>It is intended to be played with the CRT filter on. But I added the ability to deactivate it (buying a cutting-edge LCD TV ;).</p>\n<p>This is a multiplayer game (you can create/join local server or join to public server)\u00a0and implements a matchmaking feature. Let's see how performant is my lil' server and how scalable is the matchmaking strategy ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Be patient if public server does not run smoothly (or does not run at all)\u00a0 this is my very first attemp to make a public server with matchmaking. If the \"PLAY!\" (public server) option does not work... use the \"Play solo / Training\" for speedrunning.</strong></p>\n<p>The server port is:\u00a018580 (Configure your router / firewall properly if you want to setup your own server)</p>\n<p>Any bug reports, comments, greetings, memes and jokes\u00a0 will be welcomed!</p>\n<p><strong>REMEMBER: I'm using my own resources to keep this server running.\u00a0 So,\u00a0Support the author with any act of kindness if you liked the game.</strong></p>\n<p>Wait! Aren't you following me over the different social media platforms?. C'mon! You don't want to miss any future updates! ;) I will focus on more tracks, speedruns and better multiplayer support with crossplay!<br/>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/crowdedgames<br/>Itch.io:\u00a0https://crowdedgames.itch.io/<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/crowdedgames1<br/>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/crowdedgames<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WELL KNOWN BUGS:</strong></p>\n<p>- After playing on the public server if you try to play solo / training the game freezes O_o<br/>- On the public server the player \"P2\" does not move? yeah! this is the dedicated server player o_O</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>:</p>\n<p>Game Engine: the-beloved GODOT 3.2.3<br/>Tiles &amp; Sprites: Tilesetter &amp; GIMP<br/>SFX: Chiptone (https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>:</p>\n<p>Title screen and artwork by<strong> El Chorro Arts</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/elchorroarts/\u00a0<br/>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/ElChorroArts/<br/>Webpage: https://www.tattoograffitipalencia.com/</p>\n<p>\"Laser Gun\"\u00a0Theme | Album \"Pixel\"\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>DARK FANTASY STUDIO</strong>\u00a0http://darkfantasystudio.com/<br/></p>\n<p>CRT-shader: https://github.com/hiulit/Godot-3-2D-CRT-Shader/blob/master/crt_shader.shader</p>\n<p>Screen shake extension: https://godotengine.org/qa/438/camera2d-screen-shake-extension?show=438#q438</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/608ee7cd8ac79b08ea84a9e16a48ec87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Crowded Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
