The game as a whole takes a critical thinking approach and focuses on the player's torment as they are faced with a puzzle.</p>\n<p>The game uses an interpolated narrative, starting with the protagonist's memories when he is on the verge of death until he finally faces it again.</p>\n<p>Life is like a train moving forward in a fog, and the choice at each fork in the road is irreversible. But these seemingly optional junctions actually have a set focus on the track, and people sometimes appear to have choices, but the choices don't change anything.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3e5868ad2f2cc4722891874cafda745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shawn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
