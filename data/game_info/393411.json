By\u00a0using his magic staff as a weapon, you will need to kill SPOOKY enemies who were born for the only purpose of destroying this 1 portal. What lies in the portal? Is it treasure? A lost city waiting to be discovered?\u00a0A cookie? Whatever it is, you must risk your own life to\u00a0protect this portal. Everything in the game is made by me, including that horrible music :(. This game was made in 2 days for a game jam with the theme: magic.</p>\n<p><strong>You lose the game if either the player or portal is dead</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c3469d3f99357f9adf7e18b71c53e0bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DylanW2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
