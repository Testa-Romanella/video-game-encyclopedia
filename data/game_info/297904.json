Little did you know that this isn't an ordinary tower. This seemingly harmless building\u00a0is cursed to those who enter. It's victims are doomed to\u00a0go through floor and floor of traps, trials, and tribulation endlessly.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't be too bad if the tower weren't also sinking into the earth being flooded with <strong>LAVA</strong>! Think about stopping and you will be burned to a crisp. Your only salvation, if you want to call it that, is to do the tower's bidding and <em><strong>climb</strong></em>.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for Buddy Jam 3!
