There's really not much to do other than explore, the map is random each time you die or start a new game, but aside from exploring, getting new guns and powerups, and killing enemies, there is no objective.</p>\n<p>Game balancing is still being worked on, the game can be quite hard at times, especially before finding a gun.</p>\n\n<p>LESS IMPORTANT- Mini-map icons (and the Mini-map itself)\u00a0can be rotated weirdly (so can the player at the start of the game). There are rare issues with pathfinding and other oddities, hopefully nothing that makes the game unplayable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae959c6032525d77de5ed2070ded53e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hgfrtqfds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
