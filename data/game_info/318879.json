Which plugins are installed are entirely optional and can be added or removed simply by copying or deleting a folder. The first game, Drone Drop, is included in the zip file download. As the project is open source anyone can contribute, either by writing their own game plugin or submitting modifications to existing games. OSGC can also be built for other platforms such as linux and macOS, although currently only the Windows build is available for download from this page.
