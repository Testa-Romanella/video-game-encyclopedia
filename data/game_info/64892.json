After much study, they came to the conclusion that the only way to eliminate 100% of bacteria would be to eliminate them individually. So they partnered with the military to develop a micro-robot that could stand in front of the bacteria, eliminate them and repair all the damage done by them. And this micro robot was christened <strong>Flurius</strong>. Given name in reference to sodium fluoride (fluorine), which is the substance used in oral hygiene products most known to people, and serve as fuel for your jetpack.Game modesNormal<br/>In the normal way, Flurius confronts bacteria in the mouths of ordinary humans like us.
