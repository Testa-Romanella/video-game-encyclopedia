Each pack of cards in TerraScape offers different buildings and ways to expand your city. Place your cards wisely in the game world to earn points and receive new cards as rewards. Turn by turn, round by round, you skillfully build and grow your city.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe game offers several game modes, procedural maps, and exciting challenges. In Early Access, TerraScape will be expanded with more decks, maps, and game modes in the future. \n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nEach building has different influences, be it other buildings, natural resources, or the right terrain. Earn bonus points by collecting as many positive influences as possible, but beware: there are also negative influences! \n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nBy collecting points, you unlock new decks and buildings. Each deck consists of several building cards. Specialize by placing buildings of certain decks more often and cleverly, and thereby unlock more decks.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nIf you place your buildings well, you can draw new cards. But always keep an eye on your strategy and plan which cards you really need. Otherwise, you may draw buildings that are not useful for your current planning.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nThe unique map generator creates new maps with endless possibilities! Also, play handcrafted missions with increasing difficulty and show your friends and the world that you are the best player in the high score list.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nLet yourself be captivated by the unique graphic style and lovingly designed landscapes. You set the pace, so sit back and enjoy the view.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\nPlay exciting multiplayer matches with your friends! Develop your own strategies and thwart the plans of your opponents. Take advantage of stategically placed buildings and build up your point lead round by round.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-08T03:56:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d7/5d70b6265b626fe2c0d58cb7bfdf992a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 515, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitfall Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Toplitz Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
