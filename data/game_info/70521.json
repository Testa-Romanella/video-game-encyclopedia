In each round, you roll the dice and score the result in one of 13 categories.You must score exactly once in each category, so skill and judgment are required as the game progresses and your options start to run out. The aim of the game is to make the biggest score you can from the 13 rounds.<br/><br/>SCORING:<br/>After each roll, all valid scores are highlighted in yellow so you can quickly decide where to apply the results. Where you place the score from each roll is up to you. There are thirteen turns of 3 rolls each per game. After each roll you can choose which dice to keep by touching them, then the remainder will be included in the next roll. At the end of the 3 rolls, you must assign the score before you can move on to the next turn. The first Yatzee is worth 50 points and each subsequent Yatzee will be rewarded with a 100 point bonus. If you score 63 or greater on the left side of the score card, you will get a 35 point bonus.<br/><br/>We love our fans!
