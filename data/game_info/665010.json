{"id": 665010, "slug": "klondike-re-imagined", "name": "Klondike Re-Imagined", "name_original": "Klondike Re-Imagined", "description": "I'm a solitaire nut.  But I have always hated the Klondike implementations that have been available.  Why should I have to click the HINT button to see all of the available moves?  Why should I have to keep hitting the DRAW button to see the next triplet from the Talon?  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, about 15 years ago when I retired from Boeing Computing, I decided to fix these deficiencies and coded my first Klondike.  It had all available moves pre-calculated and shown as buttons.  Press the button and the move is carried out. It had the entire Talon shown at once (again, with move buttons).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd over the years, as I played my new Klondike, I kept thinking of other things that would be nice to have (without changing the rules).  And I added them.  Like:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStacking Maps - showing all 52 cards in stacking order (red on black) showing where each card is and whether it's theoretically playable.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuild Maps - one for each suit in build-order, showing each card is and whether it's theoretically build-able.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Talon-Lookahead - I can see the entire Talon at once.  As I play cards from the Talon, why not see the Talon as it will be the next time thru?  So this Klondike has a second view of the Talon, the Lookahead-Talon.  Available moves are calculated for both of them and you can even play directly from the Lookahead (which of course causes the Lookahead to become the Talon and a new Lookahead to be computed).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nConnector-Cards - The main thrust of Klondike is moving cards so that a downcard is exposed for a flip.  Why not have the Klondike programing figure out all of the theoretical opportunities for exposing downcards and display which cards (Connector-Cards) need to be moved in order to do it?  So this Klondike calculates all Connector-Cards and hilites them in yellow on the Stacking Maps and the Build Maps.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Have-We-Lost Algorithm  -  If a game becomes  theoretically impossible to win, I want to know right away, so I can resign and go on to a deal that isn't theoretically impossible.  (Life is short!)  It took me three years of development, but this Klondike's Have-We-Lost Algorithm is killer.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo what do all of these improvements do to the game?  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWell, the rules are still exactly the same.  And Klondike's anti-anxiety properties are still there.  But with all of the added visibility, you can really see what's going on.  So the game becomes more of a puzzle-to-be-solved.  And it allows for some strategies that you never even thought of before.  And it is way, way more fun!  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, I'm thinking that there must be some other Klondike nuts out there who will enjoy this re-imagined Klondike as much as I do.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMike Edwards", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T04:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca9/ca9c3c10ddf7f238ca413c129b3ba7cf.jpg", "website": "http://KlondikeReimagined.carapace.me", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Edwards"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Mike Edwards"], "esrb_rating": null}
