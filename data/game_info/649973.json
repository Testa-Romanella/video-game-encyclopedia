It is about an executioner's first day on the job after a Luddite  Revolution. I can certainly say I learnt alot in this jam, as it was  the first game I have ever properly used physics, and overall I'm happy  with what we made, but time constraints certainly had an impact on the  final product resulting in things such as all the Audio I wanted not being able to be  added. Perhaps I will add them later if the response to the game is  positive enough. \r\n  \r\nHuge thanks to the hosts of the N8Jam for setting the whole thing  up, with an extra thanks to Manisha for sending me a Copy-Pastable text  of the lore so I didn't have to write it out myself. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T07:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d35f11c40cb5e3e82be717dc8700212.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Valis Systems"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
