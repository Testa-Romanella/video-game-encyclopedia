Additionally the round start marks the spawn of new enemies and objects around the arena.</p>\n<p>Controls are traditional, WASD to move, mouse cursor to aim and left click to shoot. Unfortunately no mobile or controller support.</p>\n<p>Goal is simply to last as many round as possible. If you can make it to double digits you've had a good run.</p>\n<p>Game is quick to play, best of luck!</p>\n<p>LDJam Link: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/decarounds</p>\n<p>Itch.io Link: https://tharbakim.itch.io/decarounds</p>\n<p>## Known Issues</p>\n<p>On subsequent plays, the WASD keys can not be used to enter a player name.</p>\n<p>## Post-Submission Changelog</p><p>* Added fix for attempting to fire weapon before it is initialized</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T07:00:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c4453ab220a6fe9e80114dd2447083ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tharbakim"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
