It is dominated by the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization, the Precursors. This civilization also created eco, a type of energy that comes in different colors and can be used to various effects. There\u2019s the dark eco that can distort life, and its Dark Sage, Gol Acheron, is going to unleash it on the world. He sent his servants, the Lurkers, to gather eco for him.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player assumes the role of Jak, a mute yet troublemaking teenage boy. His best friend is a boy called Daxter. When the two explored the forbidden ruins, the Lurkers attacked them. Daxter came under the influence of dark eco and mutated into a mixture of otter and weasel he calls \u201cottsel.\u201d He can still talk, however, and will comment on Jak\u2019s actions throughout the game. Jak learns that only Gol Acheron can bring Daxter back to normal. The boy, accompanied by Daxter on his shoulder, sets out on a dangerous journey to save his friend and the world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Much of the gameplay is centered around collecting items and resources. On each level, Jak has to obtain power cells to activate Precursors\u2019 machines and advance to the next area. Other collectibles, such as eco particles, improve the protagonist\u2019s attacks, health, or speed. Jak\u2019s attacks are mostly hand-to-hand, but yellow eco allows him to shoot bolts.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2001-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-17T19:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c17/c17f265300a6adca4cde82562829cd92.jpg", "website": "http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Jak_and_Daxter_The_Precursor_Legacy/OGS/", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 66, "owned": 1168, "beaten": 317, "toplay": 36, "dropped": 93, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 234, "ratings_count": 374, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 377, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Naughty Dog"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
