The veterans will definitely notice some items they have never seen before as well as a new graphic design. But all this is just the tip of the iceberg. The biggest revolution is in the gameplay itself. We have completely redefined all the mechanics: from now on you are not getting rid of all the dirt from the counter with a single click - swing that virtual brush yourself!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Looking for new VR challenges?  You have come to the right place - just about time for a makeover! Look through your goggles to see all the wrecked houses crying out loud for your help. Grab the controllers and get to work! You will single-handedly assemble the heaters, plaster the walls, and do tens of other jobs to bring back the former glory of the place.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Renovation activities require a lot of effort, so we got you some backup. Uncle Harry will take you under his wings, regularly seeking new special jobs for you to take on: one client might need an overnight express cleaning after a party, another will require some help with his family problems - you will not get bored!<br/>During the renovation process, you can always count on Beaver the Builder!<br/>This animated companion will not only bring a smile to your face but will also support you, explaining the elements of the game. He is not only taking care of the woodwork!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There is a series of challenging renovations ahead of you, so do not hesitate!<br/>Reach for your tool belt, get your crew and take matters in your own hands. Are you going to become the best flipper? It is all up to you!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T03:45:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec6b3650ba3033f965dd793a49502b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 142}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozen District"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frozen District"], "esrb_rating": null}
