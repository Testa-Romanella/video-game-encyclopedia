I'm pretty experienced with Godot's 2D functionality and from this experience I can see a lot of that translated pretty well to 3D...\u00a0</p><p>If you're looking for the source code for the game, I'll gladly give it to anyone who asks in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T23:17:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fdaa124d4c01ba5f09c9c12d8ecc98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Willowblade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
