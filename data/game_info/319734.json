The theme was \"Beneath the Surface\", so I made a Bit.trip Runner-style rhythm game with game boy-esque graphics and chiptune music. This is probably my most famous and popular flash game to date. You could consider it my \"thesis\" work, since it combines a lot of my core aesthetics: Chiptune music, difficult gameplay, and pixel art.</p>\n<p><strong>Awards (out of 1492 compo entries):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>#2 in Overall</li><li>#2 in Theme</li><li>#2 in Audio</li><li>#3 in Fun</li></ul>\n<p>Ludum Dare submission page</p>\n<p>Original compo version submitted to Ludum Dare</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc1/dc1a0d29e3164ba6bb140b32da4e042f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DDRKirby(ISQ)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
