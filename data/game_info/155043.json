Made using the great TIC-80.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I have always found Fantasy Consoles pretty charming and interesting, but their simplicity also scared me away a bit. I mean, in Godot for instance collisions are handled just by adding a Collision Shape to your body; in a FC, however, you got know how to use your AABBs if you want anything to collide with anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Still, I tried learning some stuff last week, and since the Weekly Game Jam is stress free (as is said on the jam description), I made something to do with matches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Finally, even if this is pretty simple, I learned a lot and found that using a Fantasy Console can be pretty fun, along with being very challenging! I hope to use TIC-80 more on the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a0To see the Source code, just press Esc once the game is loaded, chose to exit the game, and press F1.\u00a0It is in JavaScript, and very messy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c75/c755c2704524fea1ff9c7028db345aab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Delta Key"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
