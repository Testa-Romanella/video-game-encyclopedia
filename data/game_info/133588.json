I was originally never going to publish it, but since I couldn't get my main idea ready in time for #PROCJAM 2017, I\u00a0decided to quickly wrap it up and submit this one.</p>\n<p>You can read about my method for generating the flowers in this blog post.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0expect many bugs, especially on the experiments, and will try to fix some of them. Feel free to report!</p>\n\n<p>Scroll down for hints &amp; tips if you're stuck, but remember that discovering the mechanics is a mechanic in itself!</p>\n\n<p>-------<br/></p>\n<p>Since I didn't have time to revise the UX and I've noticed a lot of people having problems, here's a few tips:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Water is white</strong>, so if you see white smoke, that's steam, and not your substance!</li><li>All the substances <strong>boil either before or after 100C</strong>.</li><li>Distillation works by <strong>completely separating water and the substance</strong>, which means you'll either evaporate all the water first, then the substance, or just the substance, and water will be left on the left one.</li><li><strong>Experiments can be deceiving!</strong> If your rat died or got sick, it's not necessarily a poison, and if your rat goes back to normal, it might not be a normalization agent. Do several experiments in several concentrations and rat states.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/006/00693e1dd19d950bd8299c4c94cdc9c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yanko Oliveira"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
