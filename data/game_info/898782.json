That's because it is and we love it because of that haha<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:<br/></p>\n<p>The <strong>elf</strong> uses WASD or the Arrow keys to move, collect presents by moving ACROSS one side of the screen to the other as you must deposit them back where the glowly stuff is to earn points.<br/></p>\n<p>S.A.N.T.A uses the MOUSE either using left or right click to try and turn the elf into a present.<br/><br/>Enjoy our little goofy game!<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Puffy_Pancake for the art and coding<br/><br/>BSS for the Santa model<br/><br/>Jason for the background concepts<br/><br/>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T09:09:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76be0f5882d09ec28c1c04f85ee90e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Puffy_Pancake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
