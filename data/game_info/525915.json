Thank you for your time, and enjoy!<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to Gelum, a whimsical place far from the reach of modern comforts and the last stronghold where the townspeople worship the old Gods. As their faith dwindles, the modern world eventually finds its way to this sanctuary as rising energy company GMH Corp. builds its newest factory here. The disruption infuriates the local spirit that resides in the forest. It's up to you to  choose what direction the spirit will take the town in.<br/></p>\n<p>Esc to view/configure controls</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for checking out our game!</p>\n\n<p>This was a collaboration effort brought to you by Studio 8:</p>\n<p>Art: Ellen Hernandez &amp; Jada Haynes\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music &amp; Audio: Amanda Willis &amp; Matthew Garcia</p>\n<p>Programmers: Angel Jimenez &amp; Olivia Elmers<br/></p>\n\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>Gelum is a\u00a0 narrative driven\u00a02D platformer that focuses on this environmental consciousness and how this effects the player's world.
