You and up to 3 other friends must take control of a variety of turrets and defend your cities against the onslaught of the Five Worlds Legion; a consortium of aliens that want your idyllic homeworld of Anidran and all its resources. Protect the Headquarters! Weather the storm!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Supports Keyboard and various controllers (XBox, Playstation, General USB).</p>\n<p><em>Steer Turret:</em>\u00a0A and D, or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p><em>Fire: </em>Space or\u00a0Z</p>\n<p><em>AltFire</em>: CTRL or X</p>\n<p><em>Cycle Turret selection on spawn:</em> [ and ]</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the alpha demo is available for feedback, with the ability to play\u00a04-player co-op battles over the city of Natolia, at your desired length and difficulty. There are 4 distinct turrets to pick from:</p>\n<p><strong>[Turret Alpha]</strong> - \"The Lance\" : this turret is slow firing, but the high power plasma bolt will punch through almost anything, cutting a swathe through the enemy battle-line.</p>\n<p><strong>[Turret Bravo] </strong>- \"The Detonator\"\u00a0: use the secondary fire button to detonate the warheads this turret fires. Each explode in a powerful shock-wave that destroys most enemies with ease.</p>\n<p><strong>[Turret Charlie]</strong> - \"The Flak\" : rapid firing a stream of fairly fast flak shells, this turret is great at taking out numerous smaller foes.</p>\n<p><strong>[Turret Delta]</strong> - \"The Defender\" : a well-balanced turret firing powerful pulses at a steady rate, that can often penetrate enemy armour to hit other enemies behind them.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0For full release, we're hoping to add a number of exciting features including a series of mission challenges and a \"campaign\" meta-game with linked battles and non-linear progress. There are also new enemies on the way; and some new turrets as well perhaps...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T02:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff6bdd3bafaa3877e795f48d4520878.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Centauri Interactive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
