Submitted in partial fulfillment for Michigan State University's specialization course in Game Development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Required Screenshots:</p>\n\n<p>Hierarchy be looking clean af~</p>\n\n<p>Project folder be fresh as heck, no cap~</p>\n<p>I added Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Mercury for the project. Changed FOV, added another comet spawner using a different Z angle to add some effect. Changed its spawn point too. Oh and the added planets have sounds (gathered from freesound.org of course) and includes texture from the base archive. I only included 2 platforms for this one - webGL and windows. For some reason, my hub wont let me install mac OS and iOS modules. Will figure it out soon!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Would also like to say Hi to my classmates, super exciting days ahead~ Though I have spent more time actually trying to make unity work rather than the game development... I think it'll get a lot better. Cheers!<br/><br/>Made by Francis S.<br/></p><p>Do follow me here or message me if you're taking the course as well! Would love to have you as contacts! Let's work on the course together :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T10:51:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b8e3d33526d9474dfeb5665bfb05be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["francisTriesItch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
