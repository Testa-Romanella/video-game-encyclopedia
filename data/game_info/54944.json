The player begins the game riding a superbike. In subsequent levels a sports car, a jet via added wings, jetski, helicopter and Formula One racing car can all be driven, as seen in the game's title screen. All of the vehicles are fully armed to deal with enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player's progress. The helicopter levels play as a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up and resembles Xevious.</p>\n<p>This game was also ported to the Sega Master System and later to all the most popular home computer platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/512/512ec77ff62a030b55d957b5642f00a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
