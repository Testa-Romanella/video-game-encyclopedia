All packed into cute, colorful, lovely graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>Our main character Felix wakes up in Heaven not knowing how he got there. He\u2019s greeted by an angel who offers him to look around and find a hobby he wants to do till the end of time. Unfortunately, none of the offers seem to be interesting so he wanders deeper until he gets to a forbidden place called the Garden of Eden - and there\u2019s no way of getting out of there. How is he going to escape this place? Is there any way out of the boring Heaven?\u00a0He will soon discover that Heaven is not only exceptionally boring but also there\u2019s something weird, un-Heavenly happening. Reveal more about this strange place, its residents and how it\u2019s run by interacting with the NPCs, inspecting objects, and listening to Felix\u2019s snarky comments.</p>\n<p>The Team (Desperatos)<br/>\u00a0Game Designer: <strong>L\u00edda Hrn\u010d\u00ed\u0159ov\u00e1</strong><br/>\u00a0Artist: <strong>Lucie Ga\u0161par\u00ednov\u00e1</strong><br/>\u00a0Programmer: <strong>Kourosh Riahidehkordi</strong></p>\n<p>Afterlife - Dogs of Eden is a 2D Adventure game created for the PC platform. it was created in one semester as part of the course computer games development at Charles university in Prague.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9edd25345b4095446bf0bc5a7b0bcddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kooroshoo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
