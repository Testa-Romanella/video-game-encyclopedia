You're a tank in a pit of abandoned Christmas crap. Are those rocks? Are they coal? Doesn't matter: everyone is naughty in the pit, and the Snowmen are about to judge you harder than an anonymous teenager on the internet.</p><p>----</p><p><strong>Plenty of bugs:</strong> snowmen vanish and get confused. You can flip yourself somewhat easily, if you're determined.</p><p><strong>I'll spend the next day or two finishing up.</strong> Lots of ideas not added to hit the Jam deadline that will make this a bit more fun: planned for the tank to hold a <em>limited supply of snowballs</em>, and be able to reload from supplies that will spawn around the map.
