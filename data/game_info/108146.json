Brian and Gloria Freezby are back in their home town for the weekend and are taking a stroll on Shaker St. together with their dog Dido. Suddenly, they are approached by a group of hooligans. One of them, visibly bigger than the others, steps out of the group. It's Brian\u2019s old rival - Arkian Joel. Arkian does some smack talk and orders a bunch of his thugs to grab Gloria and Dido. He then leaves his gang to take care of the <em>Brian problem</em>.</p>\n<p>Brian faces the bad guys in fight and after defeating them continues down on Shaker St. determined to find Arkian and save his wife and dog.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Kickpunch</strong></p>\n<p>We are\u00a0@Charliiee,\u00a0@LampEight,\u00a0@n3tn0de, @PsyBack\u00a0and\u00a0@petarov.</p>\n<p>This game is our entry to GitHub's annual\u00a0Game Off 2017\u00a0game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Track KickPunch's development or open a pull request at\u00a0GitHub.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42b/42bc23e358833bc5e0c3fce0b55168f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KENAMICK Entertainment", "n3tn0de", "Charliiee", "lampeightaudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
