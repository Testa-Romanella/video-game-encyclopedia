HD", "description": "Meet a cast of oddball characters and solve puzzles in this delightfully witty point and click adventure game. Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! is your opportunity to:<br/><br/><ul><li>Rescue endangered and unusually named wildfowl.<br/></li><li>Acquire morally dubious items on behalf of minor aristocrats.<br/></li><li>Intercept the private correspondances of a daredevil pilot.<br/></li><li>Come to the aid of downtrodden supernatural beings.<br/></li><li>Be confused by obscure colloquialisms.<br/></li><li>Borrow facial hair from long-dead pirates.<br/></li><li>Wantonly misuse the word 'borrow'.</li></ul>Background<strong>Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy!</strong> was originally released hundreds of years ago in 2007, when beards weren't popular and there hardly any Nazis. Times, they have a-changed. The game started out as a birthday present for my girlfriend and got wildly out of hand. In 2016, I even made another Nelly game called <strong>Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet</strong>. This HD remastering brings the original game back to life, with a streamlined interface and loads more pixels.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46b/46b4d4f6384fb02d2d5c1933206a6b57.jpg", "website": "http://www.nellycootalot.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 85, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Application Systems Heidelberg", "Alasdair Beckett-King"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Application Systems Heidelberg"], "esrb_rating": null}
