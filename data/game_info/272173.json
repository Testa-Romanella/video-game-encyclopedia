It is currently in development for Microsoft Windows PCs as a university project.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to use a projectile to hit a target on the other side of level. To do so, players will need to bounce their projectiles off the level's walls and obstacles. Be careful, though: each projectile can bounce only a few times before being destroyed, and your supply is limited.<br/></p>\n<p>Relfketor is actively being developed so look out new versions in the near future.</p>\n<p>Sound effects were sourced from third parties via Freesound.org.
