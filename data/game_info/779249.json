Try to keep up, and don't mind the blood.<br/><br/>As an unpaid intern, your responsibilities will primarily include:\r\n1. Unclogging toilets<br/>2. Repairing company equipment<br/>3. Disposing of the remains of former employees<br/>4. Fetching miscellaneous items for higher ranking staff<br/>5. And any number of other, smaller tortures<br/><br/>Remember, if an employee is unable to complete their assigned tasks within the unreasonable time frame provided, said employee will be forcefully *RESET*. We hope you hate your stay, thank you for your un-cooperation.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Upper Management\r\n\r\n\r\nMeet Dante, an unpaid intern in Hell, working his way to the top of the *incorporeal ladder*. No matter your sins or status in life, every soul in the underworld must start somewhere. And for Dante, that somewhere is the very bottom. <br/><br/>Work hard, work smart, work fast, but above all... try not to get RESET.\r\n\r\nUse WASD to Move\r\n\r\nUse Number Keys to Select items. Use Tab to Cycle items.\r\n\r\nUse Q to Drop and Swap items. Use E to Interact with items and objects.\r\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:31:28", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TinyCthulu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
