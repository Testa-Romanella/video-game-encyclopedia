To advance the game, press the A button.\u00a0\u00a0The game rules (also accessible from within the game) are as follows:\u00a0</p>\r\nPlayers play 1 card each in turn, following the lead suit where possible. The highest-ranked card of the lead suit wins the trick, and the winner leads the next trick. Players may not lead with <strong>Hearts</strong>\u00a0until a <strong>Heart</strong>\u00a0has been played. The aim of the game is to avoid winning tricks containing <strong>Hearts</strong>\u00a0and <strong>Queens</strong>. If a player cannot follow the lead suit, they must play according to the following hierarchy: <strong>Queen of Hearts</strong>\u00a0(14 points), any <strong>Heart</strong>\u00a0(1 point), any <strong>Queen</strong>\u00a0(13 points), any other card. Fewest points accumulated after 4 rounds wins.\r\nWhichever player wins the first trick is given the option to declare that they will attempt to '<strong>shoot the moon</strong>'. If that player declares so and then successfully takes all 65 points in that round, they will instead score 0 points and all other players will score 65 points each. Be warned though: if a player declares they are <strong>shooting the moon</strong>\u00a0and fail to take all the points in that round they will instead automatically score the maximum 65 points and all other players will score 0 points. Happy hunting.\r\n<p>There are two ways you can play this game:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>You can sideload it to your Playdate console.
