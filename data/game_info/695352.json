The sender was an old classmate, a boy named Marc and with whom I shared a couple of years at the desk until he left school for some reason that I still do not know. On several occasions I met his sister, Karla, a couple of years older than him and with whom he got along wonderfully well. After both of them left, I never heard from them again and my surprise was to receive her invitation, as pleasant as it was strange at the same time.</em></p>\n<p><em>So I made the preparations and left, without thinking twice, with a destination almost chosen at random and hoping that benevolence would travel with me and compensate for the shortage of time for myself. I only asked for a few days of escape that were pleasantly awaited and I think deserved.</em></p>\n<p><em>And without anticipating the path that you yourself must undertake towards Torreoscura, with its hazards and fatalities, which I never thought or would have imagined would happen, took over my life and here now I am, isolated from the world and where I can only hope that someone will come and take me out of this eternal loneliness and the curse that bites and lengthens every moment in my life as it withers it with relentless speed.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are in front of a classical text adventure.
