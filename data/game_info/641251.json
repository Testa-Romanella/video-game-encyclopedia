It's a VR game, and it's about time stopping like in \"The Matrix\" - you can slow down time and grab or dodge bullets, so you feel like Neo. The game itself has a James Bond theme (hence the name) and is inspired by games like \"I Expect You To Die\" and \"The Stanley Parable\". I even managed to get a voice actor to play the typical voice in the agent's ear, who introduces the mechanics and gives a short introduction.</p>\n<p>For a playthrough of the game, you can click\u00a0here, which shows the game being played by the markers of the course.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:38:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa81eca53a20c4e79cb2c0ca32c1f8a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IoIoToTM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
