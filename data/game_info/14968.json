The game first appeared on the public in 2009 on the developer&#39;s site and the Impulse site, and later appeared on Steam in version 2.0.</p>\n<h3>Interesting mix</h3>\n<p>The developers tried to combine in the game at once three genres: real-time strategy, tower defense, and 4X-strategy. Players and critics celebrated the unique gameplay but at the same time a fairly long process of learning the basics of the game. The main rivals of the players are two AI, the main goal - to destroy their planets. AI at the start has unfair advantages over the player, controlling the huge fleets of spacecraft. The game map usually consists of 10 to 120 star systems, its size greatly affects the game strategy necessary for victory.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The main feature of the game is the confrontation of players with artificial intelligence. According to the developers in AI War, this problem was solved: the local computer can think on three levels, adapt to the player&#39;s style of the opponent&#39;s game and surprise with illogical moves and attacks for the robot. DLC for the game, in addition to new units, maps and soundtrack, brought new types of artificial intelligence, victory over which becomes for players a kind of puzzle.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2009-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a02/a0237f1c389317a94d876f6df9c20da0.jpg", "website": "http://arcengames.com/ai-war/", "rating": 2.48, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 86, "owned": 1435, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 322, "ratings_count": 50, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 50, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Arcen Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arcen Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
