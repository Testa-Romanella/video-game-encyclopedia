Your goal is to match numbers with other dice to clear your way to victory. Will you learn the ways of the dice or lose your mind in the challenges?\u00a0 It will be possible to aimlessly wander into a solution but can you do it in as few steps as possible. Try to do a \"great job\" in every level.</p>\n<p>The game models the \"physics\" of rolling a right-handed six-sided die on a plane.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 in 48 hours. Due to limited time the game may contain bugs, and you might find more optimal solutions than required for the \"great job\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4ac702fbd13f9005b8908d8da6a317b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AxisFIN"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
