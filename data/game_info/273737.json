You are tasked with running this first factory and overseeing its workers. But the process is difficult to execute, so your inexperienced workers will produce cheap substitutes at first. Financial loss is imminent, but there is always the option of cutting pauses in order to increase factory output while sacrificing your workers\u2019 health. And at some point in their lives your employees working power will decrease again, making it less and less \u2018unfortunate\u2019 should they expire due to overworking. How far are you willing to go in pursuit of the greater good, i.e. world domination fueled by 10Up (which means 100 drinks produced without going bankrupt)?</p>\n<p>Made by Ingo Jakobs and Christian Reuter, contains sprites and code fragments created by Martin and Robert Konrad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a1ac3c6c610abeff25dcc3b55deadf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AoE-Maniac"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
