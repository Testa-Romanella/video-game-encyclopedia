{"id": 18314, "slug": "minotaur", "name": "Minotaur", "name_original": "Minotaur", "description": "An adventure game with visual novel-style narrative, Minotaur tells a dark mystery story set in a newly created science fantasy world. It is a game inspired by Zero Escape and Danganronpa series, various visual novels and old-school point-and-click quests by LucasArts, Sierra and others.GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>A picture is worth a thousand words!

At the risk of sounding cocky, we think it looks really cool. And its native resolution is full HD.STORY AND CHARACTERS<br/><br/>Minotaur tells a story about a group of nine characters (five of which are playable) who find themselves unable to leave their own home. Tensions rise as things start to take turn for the worse and it becomes clear that their unfortunate situation is not an accident, but a trap of elaborate design. Revealing the identity of its creator and understanding their motives is now the matter of life and death.<br/><br/>The story unfolds from perspective of five different characters, and although you can only unlock routes in succession, your actions and choices in each of them have universal effect and lead to one of four different endings.SETTING<br/><br/>We created our own universe with blackjack and hook... sorry, demons and penguins. We called it The Universe of Seven. It's a very detailed science fantasy world with its own history, geography, rulebook and characters. We hope that Minotaur will be the first in a series of games set in U7. Other U7 projects we're currently working on are Red Crown, a novel scheduled for 2018 and a prequel to Minotaur, and a board game....<br/><br/>We hope you like Minotaur (remember that you can check out our 0.2 demo to get a better feel for the game). Let us know what you think, feedback is important. We listen and try to make Minotaur better.
