The theme for this Ludum\u00a0Dare was 'combine 2 incompatible game genres'. My idea was to combine the traditional mechanics of 2-D side scrolling games with a 3-D first person perspective.\u00a0All mechanics and art were made by me.</p>\n<p>There are many bugs, especially when it comes to jumping. This was my first solo Ludum Dare.</p>\n<p>You can jump on the heads of <strong>some</strong> enemies to score points and kill them.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>W - Forward<br/>S - Back<br/>Space - Jump<br/>L-Shift - Sprint<br/>L-Ctrl - Crouch<br/>Tab - Rotate 180</p>\n<p>Something to note, a sprint-jump gets slightly more height than jumping at the standard movement speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Jam\u00a0Fix - V1.3</strong></p>\n<p>- Fixed a bug where upon losing all lives and failing the game, pressing any key would not return you to the main menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Jam Fix -\u00a0V1.2</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Fixed a bug where the score and life UI values would not update when loading level 2.</p>\n<p>- Fixed an issue where one of the pits in level 2 did not have a trigger and the player would fall through the map.</p>\n<p>- Slightly reduced the size of the player's collider to try fix any issues of getting stuck between cubes.</p>\n<p>- Changed the movement pattern for one of the cube hazards in level 2 from horizontal to vertical so that it is more obvious.</p>\n<p>- Fixed an issue with the in-game pause menu.</p>\n<p>- Fixed the position of some of the road models in level 2.</p>\n<p>- Added a mouse cursor sprite.</p>\n<p>- Added a post-processing stack to the player's camera.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-Jam Fix -\u00a0V1.1</strong></p>\n<p>- Fixed a bug where the buttons on the main menu would not work upon returning to the main menu from in-game.</p>\n<p>- Baked lightmaps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d5/1d5629e4a76e4f5bf4629fb6c0c5cafc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarrixx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
