This game full of \n      mini-games will test your ability to think outside the box and use the \n      Wii U\u2122 GamePad to solve various problems. Rules come and go as they \n      please and it's up to you to decipher the solutions to the problems... \n      and maybe even what it's asking in the first place! If you manage to \n      pass the test (don't worry, it's fair), have a friend or family member \n      try it and you might struggle to hold in your laughter as THEY struggle \n      to figure out what they're doing! When you've figured out all the \n      problems, play a fast-paced memory game in local multiplayer and see who \n      can win a battle of brains. Just don't hurt your mind\u2014we only want to \n      test it!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T23:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcc/dcceda7e7b2b7674eb261a702a813c6a.jpg", "website": "http://www.xenohorizon.com/test-your-mind/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["XenoHorizon"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["XenoHorizon"], "esrb_rating": null}
