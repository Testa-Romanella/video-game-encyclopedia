A 2D Shooter", "description": "<p>Here is my modified 2D Shooter project!</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a space rat who is combatting aliens who are trying to bring him back to his home planet after he had previously escaped to earth.</p>\n<p>My modifications to the game are as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Re-skinned the player and its projectiles as the space squirrel, and made animations for them with a sprite sheet. The player is now a purple glowing squirrel, who shoots purple acorns.\u00a0Additionally, I changed the shooting and death sounds for the player.</p>\n<p>2. Additionally, I re-skinned the background and barriers of the game, to make the setting make sense for the story. Instead of space with asteroid barriers, the game now takes place in a meadow, presumably on Earth, with a chain link fence as the boundary.</p>\n<p>3. My final modification was adding 2 additional levels, so that there were 5 levels total.\u00a0I also reworked the levels I had already made, so that there was a clear progression of difficulty as the game moved on. The final two levels sharply increase in difficulty , while the first 3 are relatively straightforward and allow the players to learn the game.</p>\n<p>Finally, I also redid some of the UI elements, although I wouldn't necessarily consider that as one of my modifications. I added instructions for the game, and also updated the level picker UI and the title slide of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game designed by Carter Brown.</p>\n<p>Player, player projectiles, background and boundary sprites by Carter Brown.</p>\n<p>Player shoot and death audio by Carter Brown.</p>\n<p>The rest of the sprites, audios, scripts, and assets\u00a0were provided by the Instructor Brian Winn from\u00a0Michigan State University.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:19:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca9/ca9b8e54dadd15104bb164199140b1e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gcbg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
