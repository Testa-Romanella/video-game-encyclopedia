In \"Good Luck on Your Job Interview,\" the player is subjected to a series of endless and fruitless job interviews, presented as an anti-motivational training program. To answer the interviewer's questions, the player must click on the correct words, which fly about the room, while avoiding the incorrect ones. If the player does not promptly achieve this task, the interview is terminated and the game is over. </p><p>The primary aim of this project is showcase interactivity's potential as a means of communication. Often, games rely on content to contextualize and lend meaning their mechanics. This project explores how interactivity can be communicative in itself. To this end, it aims to create mechanics that express the suppression, strain and turmoil that comes with socially-sanctioned dishonesty, particularly that of a job interview.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a62688b798eeaab749a74bf227392e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["tgraham97"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
