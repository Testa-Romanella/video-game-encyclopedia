Windspeeds are so high and in such chaotic patterns that visibility is low and so is predictability. Perfect time for a <strong>Non-Linear Snowball Fight!</strong></p>\n<p>In this game you (and some friends and/or NPCs) must throw snowballs at each other, one hit takes you out of the round, last one standing scores. The catch is that the snowstorm winds are teleporting the snowballs all over the place. No hitting others from point-blank, so you must figure out the teleport pattern before your enemies do (or just throw them everywhere and hope you survive).</p>\n<p>This light, ridiculous, hybrid-action-puzzle-shooter will have you and your friends laughing and calling for another quick round.<br/></p>\n<p>Non-Linear Snowball Fight was made for the github game-off using the godot game engine. Find the source at https://github.com/ssj71/nonlinearsnowballfight<br/></p><p>Unfortunately I ran out of time and had to cut many features (including tutorials) and didn't get to balance it very well. Currently 2 players are supported, one using arrow keys + spacebar to shoot, another using wasd + Shift to shoot. Press the shoot button in the menu to join the game. Each round brings you back to the menu, keeping score of all the rounds. There is no end to the game, just quit when you get bored or hungry or whatever.</p><p>Enoy!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6f1971e5d3e22daf1636182710af630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ssj71"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
