I need to learn more for sure, more math and programming techniques. My code could be cleaning but i'm in the beginning of my game programming journey. I will release the game files for this game soon. You will need game maker studio 2 in order to play around with what i made. You are free to use what i made to your own projects if using my art then just leave credit but code can be use freely.</p>\n\n<p>Message me if there are issues with the game or game files.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e68545a8ad49e92a29f5f5116d0ebbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sparacios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
