After every Level either your controlls or your Abillitis change. <br/>Try to complete as much Leves as possible before dying.</p>\n<p>PS: Start Controll: Move with WASD and shoot with left Mouse Button</p>\n\n<p>PPS: If Unity would have Build my Game without Errors, i could have participated. Until now, i still don't have a playable windows Edition. Only a WebGL one, where I don't kno how to upload it correctly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f11/f11fa02f35a6883e96c65dc192b936ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DrKeks1010"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
