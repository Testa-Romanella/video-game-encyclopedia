It seems you have found yourself caught in the middle of an meteor storm. Now you must face The Asteroid Belt's Trial and try your best to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChip away at meteors with your ship's infinite amount of ammo, or blow them out of this galaxy completely with your limited set of bombs! You gain points for destroying meteors and landing on small moons that occasionally come into orbit. However, the longer you stay on a moon, the more points you will lose. You will also lose points for accidentally destroying moons instead of meteors, so be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTry your best to both beat the game and the highscore. Doing this will unlock the \"NEW GAME PLUS\" mode! A challenge for those who have proven themselves and wish to put their skills to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(Developer's Tip: You will gain an extra life at 25000 points)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGOOD LUCK SPACE TRAVELER!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(Note: While the ship may look small in the screenshots, the game is meant to be played in full screen which gives you a much better view of the action!)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n30+ ACHIEVEMENTS!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e1484b2a2ca326950cd9dcab0a59904c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby's Gloves"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bobby's Gloves"], "esrb_rating": null}
