The year? <strong>2022.</strong>\r\n  You lead an advanced force of ships and pilots who have been cut off  from accessing the warp gate that will unite you with your allies. The  objective is to defeat the patrolling squads between you and the warp  gate. The confidence in your pilots is shaken, and you must manage time  and the battlefield to achieve your goal.\r\n</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<ul><li>Your willingness to continue is shown as your <strong>morale</strong>. If you run out of this, the game is over.\r\n</li><li>Every round your pilots will enter the battlefield by rolling their <strong>power</strong> die to determine their <strong>threat.</strong>\n</li><li>You and the enemy squad will take turns using a pilots <strong>threat</strong> to disable an opposing ship with lower <strong>threat</strong>. After this maneuver, your <strong>threat</strong> is rerolled.\r\n</li><li>You may use two ships to disable one opposing ship, but the <strong>threat</strong> must perfectly match the opposing ship's <strong>threat.</strong>\n</li><li>When a ship is disabled, the owners <strong>morale</strong> is damaged by the <strong>attack</strong> of the attacking ship minus the <strong>defense</strong> of the defending ship.\r\n</li><li>When all ships are removed from one squad, if they have the <strong>morale</strong> to continue, they will regroup with one <strong>reinforcement</strong> ship.\r\n</li><li>When an opponent is defeated, manage your remaining time before the next encounter by engaging in downtime activities.\r\n</li><li>If you use too much time, your next opponent will be better prepared for the combat, raising their <strong>morale</strong>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T06:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224602f81729c8b7e7b71819cb8a6433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CK BC Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
