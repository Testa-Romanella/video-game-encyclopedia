It is part of the Deception series.</p>\n<p>The player assumes the role of Princess Allura, who has been framed for the murder of her father, King Olaf. On the night of the King&#39;s murder, Allura is accused of killing him by her stepmother, Catalina. With the help of her friend Rachel, Allura is able to escape into a forest. On the run from assassins, she acquires the ability to set a series of traps, which are the only means she has of defending herself from her pursuers.</p>\n<p>-GAMEPLAY-<br />\nPlayers begin by equipping and making traps for Allura to take with her into the game mission. Each mission starts in a specific room, where players can position traps in order to defeat enemies. The traps are classified into three types according to where they can be positioned within the game world (wall, ceiling, and floor). The player is allowed to take up to three traps of each type into a game stage, and additional traps can be obtained by completing the game. Enemies&#39; life bars are shown at the top of the screen, while Allura&#39;s life bar and active traps are shown at the bottom left and right respectively. As the player defeats enemies they are rewarded with &quot;warl&quot;, the game&#39;s currency, which can be used to purchase new traps between missions. Players may also purchase room keys, which allow Allura to access other rooms in the game missions. Apart from the main story missions, the game also includes several &quot;side stories&quot;, which are optional missions that give different angles and insights into the game&#39;s main story. There are three official endings in the game, and a fourth that is not registered when saved onto the game file.</p>\n<p>Apart from regular traps, Trapt introduces &quot;Dark Illusions&quot;, which are pre-existing traps found throughout the mansion. Each is located in a different room and has a different effect upon an enemy. Each Dark Illusion requires certain criteria to be fulfilled before activation and can only be used once per level.</p>\n<p>Princess Allura must save her kingdom by luring her enemies into traps she has set. Chain together the perfect snares to outsmart her foes.This title has been converted from the original PlayStation\u00ae2 version to the PS3\u2122 system.
