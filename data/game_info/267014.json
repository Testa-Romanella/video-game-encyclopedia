There may never be more than 1 athlete per team's area, for example, also you cannot push someone to a cell already occupied by some athlete.</p>\n<p>Every athlete may play for both teams (depending on the roster), also athletes can be replaced twice per team, but once an athlete is benched, it cannot enter the match\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>Athletes can steal the ball or even push another athlete to steal it! Passing the ball is also very normal.</p>\n<p>Players must pass the turn between other since moving the ball (passing or throwing)\u00a0is a \"turn-less\" movement, meaning you may move and throw the ball or throw the ball first and then move (or keep passing to yourself forever and win by boredom, but not really).</p>\n<p>Athletes that go through the sides (or top and bottom) end up on the other side of the screen, and so does the ball! *wink*</p>\n<p>There is a crazy mechanic going on at the top and bottom of the screen,\u00a0I call them the roundabout. Can you guess why there is such a thing? *wink again*</p>\n<p>If you stay too long with the ball you'll have to punt it! Keep an eye on the 5-light-counter at\u00a0the bottom left of the screen.</p>\n<p>You may save, load and delete multiple saves through the numbered keys on your keyboard. Each number is a slot. It works through alerts now, it won't in the future. If you clear your browser's data, you will most likely erase your saves.<br/></p>\n<p>Updates are surely coming, including a friendly console to help through the game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d8/9d828b012b5dcc856e13a8c765b16460.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dupuqub"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
