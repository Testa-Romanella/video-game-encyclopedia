The houses will ask for food every once in a while . If you fail to supply them with said food before the timer runs out the house will lose a resident.<br/> Shops: you can get food from the shops . Every shop has a set amount of workers . More workers means that the shop can have a bigger stock. Shops periodically restock their supply based on the remaining workers .<br/> Infection: Your people can get infected by interacting with shops and houses , or by crowds and airborne viruses. If one of your infected employees gets in contact with a house or shop it will kill one of the residents or workers there.<br/></p>\n<p>Protection: By supplying your people with protective gear you can lower their chance of getting infected (Note that buying protective equipment won't lower your chance of them killing the residents and the workers they interact with)<br/> Reputation: Reputation increases or decreases the amount of money you can earn after a delivery. You earn reputation after every delivery , and lose it when your people die or they cause the death of other people.<br/> End: you lose if the population of the city falls below 30% of the starting population or your reputation drops to 0% or when all of the workers die.<br/>Controls: Right Click : place ONE way-point Shift+Right Click: place MULTIPLE way-points\u00a0<br/>Space: Pause<br/>Left Click : Select Vehicle (by clicking on it or on its icon on the bottom of the screen ), check the statistics of buildings (residents, workers etc.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada3dfd7f5b5b5d4408f89d20ee80b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GoldDeath"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
