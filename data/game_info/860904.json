Swords, daggers, and axes. Cartoonish dismemberment of monsters. A character is beaten up with a weapon and has visible blood and bruises. A character's hand is broken (not shown, but there is a somewhat visceral sound effect). Characters are implied to have their throats slit (not shown). Afterwards, you can see some blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adult Humor, Jokes, and Innuendo\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comments and jokes related to dicks, sexually-laden come-ons and flirting, spoken implications of past sexual relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character Death\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some character(s) die(s) and it's unavoidable. (However, it's not graphic.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Brief Instances of Vomiting\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are a few instances in the narration where a character is described as throwing up or characters mention vomiting. These are brief and not described in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Screen Shake and Bright/Flashing  Lights\r\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BGs, sprites, and various screen elements shake on occasion. There are a few times a bright white screen flashes quickly. This is usually momentary and used for clashing and/or impact effects during some of the action scenes.\r\n\r\n<p>Use the drop-downs for more details on any of the above warnings!
