It\u2019s a great 3D motocross trials game full of obstacles and challenges for you to beat!<br/><br/>Doubles is a memory game in which the goal is to find all image pairs. <br/>Each level starts with showing you a set of image pairs. You'll get a short amount of time to remember the location of all pairs. <br/>After the images turn over, you will have a limited amount of time to find all image pairs. The faster you pair up the images, the more points you'll earn. <br/>Try to get a score multiplier by finding multiple pairs in a row. The higher the level, the less time you'll get to remember and find all pairs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6de/6de4519117b2c5f4bd6412cece7ade7e.jpg", "website": "http://www.fox-games.nl", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fox Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["N A Vos"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
