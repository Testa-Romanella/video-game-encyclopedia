The player controls a worker robot in a charging station set in the distant future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a universe where cars are replaced by aircraft -- Electric aircraft. The player's job is to charge all the incoming aircraft by crafting batteries. Batteries are crafted with two power sources, each power source contains a number. The crafted battery will have the power of the product of the two power sources.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nMore to come\r\n<p>The game is still in development, expect more game modes and characters in the future!

The game will also learn your behavior and give you tasks you were not so good at so that you are trained to be the most efficient robot.\u00a0\u00a0We aim to build perfect robot workers in this factory.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Focus Mode\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>In focus mode, the player can choose their own training program. They can choose how long they want to train for, and what number they want to focus on.

By the end of the program, rookies will be able to learn and perfect the concept of battery charging (Multiplication)\u00a0 using power sources from 1 to 9.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Unlockables</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unlock robot outfits and express your personality!\u00a0</li><li>Rare aircraft will fly in occasionally, make sure you charge them efficiently. So that one day you can own one for yourself. Make your peers jealous by placing your favorite aircraft\u00a0in your charging station.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T14:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91ef7ca5b964b9b377d74f0c4a30cb2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tsz Yin (Owen) Tsoi"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
