This single ability creates an advantage of drastically switching up the common platforming gameplay in a number of different ways.</p>\n<p>We were also planning on making physics-based puzzles that could utilize said mechanics to manipulate objects. Unfortunately, we didn't quite manage to finish this feature till deadline.</p>\r\nPlatform and requirements\r\n<p>\u00a0This game requires a controller to play and wouldn't work without it.</p>\r\nThird-party resources\r\n<ul><li>Unreal Engine 4</li><li>FL Studio</li><li>Piskel</li><li>Coolors.co</li><li>Paint.net</li></ul>\n<p>Contributors</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Maksim Loboda</li><li>Game Design and Artwork: Lev Kamenskiy (https://le-von.itch.io/)</li><li>SFX and Music: Rostislav Litvinov</li></ul>\r\nPost scriptum\r\n<p>We would appreciate any resonable feedback.
