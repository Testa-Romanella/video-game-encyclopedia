The game also has the \"Reverse\" mode, in which you must hit as many targets as you can in the specified time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy and see how much you can dodge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T20:07:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8f4af3fbf91b51fd252ef83d2043d57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NiTeFox"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NiTeFox"], "esrb_rating": null}
