This was my first big project which I managed to finish from start to end.</p>\n<p>You can play alone or bring a friend with you. Your purpose is to defeat all the waves of enemies coming at you. Every hero has 3 skills, some of those skills are passive, others active. You can upgrade each of them after the first 3 waves. There are stats for each new enemy at the start of the wave, telling you what their strengths and\u00a0\u00a0weaknesses are.<br/></p>\n<p>If you managed to beat all the levels, or get frustrated from the difficulty, you can always go to the arena and challenge your friend in a 1vs1 match. Currently, there are two mods for 1vs1 supported. Just the two of you fighting each other to the dead or bringing monsters to the party which cannot be killed, but will make your duel harder.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Player One supports joystick.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CONTROLS</strong></p>\r\nPLAYER 1PLAYER 2ATTACKHNUM 1SPELL 1JNUM 2SPELL 2KNUM 3JUMPWUp ArrowSTOMPSDown ArrowMOVE LEFTALeft ArrowMOVE RIGHTDRight Arrow\r\n<p>Music used:\u00a0https://jonas-tyroller.itch.io/wowie-pack<br/></p>\n<p>Resources used:<br/>https://craftpix.net/\u00a0<br/>https://graphicriver.net/item/sky-birds-game-assets/7127737<br/>https://graphicriver.net/item/19-sprite-effects/12521975<br/>https://graphicriver.net/item/45-rpg-game-skill-icons/18375947<br/>https://graphicriver.net/item/18-sprite-effects/17434850<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:21:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df3468f1e123ea8fc258f9de9d83675a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["borko"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
