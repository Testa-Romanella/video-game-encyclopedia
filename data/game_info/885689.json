You can trigger Yui by clicking the main exit door once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Normal mode\u00a0</p>\n<p>The intended game play would be as follows: Saiko normally starts out dead, and you must revive her. Yui is always nearby, so keep an eye out for her as she can ambush and kill either the player or Saiko.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hard mode\u00a0</p>\n<p>Saiko has already been resurrected and is actively hungry and seeking meat, including player and yui.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T11:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e19/e1942f77fabd194168ab6932fd63180c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["habupain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
