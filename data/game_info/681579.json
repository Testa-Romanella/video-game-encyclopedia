And I tell them:\r\nThey\u2019re not simple thugs from the streets. But they\u2019re not highly trained criminals or professional robbers, either.\r\nNO WAY! There\u2019s more to them than just that. You see.\r\nSome like a bit of the good life: the big piles of money, the glamour of being reverenced in the streets.\r\nOthers are addicted to the adrenaline rush of an ongoing heist, combined with the smell of recently burned gunpowder, followed by the sound of empty shells falling on the ground.\r\nWhile some simply enjoy watching the world burn, especially when they\u2019re the ones with the empty can of gas in hand.\r\nBut Tony and Clyde are different.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, because Tony and Clyde want the whole package!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T04:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/101657724d7fa9ae5e9345db860e0aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
