The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab896764dcc6fca6f3475f63974a2c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 88}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Proteus Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Proteus Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
