{"id": 20264, "slug": "demented", "name": "Demented", "name_original": "Demented", "description": "Waking up as Bennet Helms you find yourself in a unknown place, however you do see your family which questions you deeply. <br/>You remember almost nothing but you see that something is wrong with this place, and given a choice to either just run or find your family.<br/><br/>Survive, look for clues and items, hide and try to uncover the mysterious truth of the Visual Corporation.Key features:SanitySanity <strong>controls you</strong>. It will decide many things, and you can even use it to your <strong>advantage</strong>. But what is it actually?<br/>The main character is <strong>Bennet Helms</strong> has a brain tumor on the cerebral part of the brain (The part which controls communication,  feelings, sense of reality, etc.). The tumor however can be contained with <strong>constant taking pills</strong>. <br/><br/>Now, a few <strong>effects</strong> of the Sanity are:<br/><ul><li>Makes the player <strong>hallucinate</strong> things.<br/></li><li>Spawns critters (\"They can, and they will hurt you\", the lower the sanity the more critters will come to hunt you)<br/></li><li>Decreased vision field. (Depends on the %(percentage) of the players sanity)<br/></li><li>Lowers your mental condition (Highlighting of things will be drastically decreased)<br/></li><li><strong>45%</strong> Critters starts start spawning<br/></li><li><strong>25%</strong> - Walk/Sprint slower <br/></li><li><strong>15%</strong> - Disabling the ability to sprint <br/></li><li><strong>10%</strong> - Black/White picture<br/></li><li><strong>5%</strong> - \"<strong>C-Condition</strong>\" - You will be very fast, you will ignore pain of the critters (This means you won't be effected if a critter pushes you, for example but you will receive damage), ability to see far objects, medication will be highlighted.<br/></li><li>*By hurting yourself you can go down to <strong>15% of your HP</strong> (hitpoints). Every <strong>self-injury</strong> gives the sanity bar 20% sanity.</li></ul>WCDTo simplify WCD is the \"<strong>brain</strong>\" of the Demented world. However it depends entirely on the players <strong>Health</strong> and Sanity (We will get to that in a moment). Now what does WCD do? It:<br/><ul><li>Changes the world (A wall was there buddy? Well now it isn't.)<br/></li><li>Changes the perception of many things<br/></li><li>Spawns <strong>Critters</strong> (Critters are the \"monsters\")<br/></li><li>Adds \"corruption\" to the world<br/></li><li>Plays trick with your mind<br/></li><li> System Shutdown (SS) - Changes the power in the facility.<br/></li><li>And other</li></ul>Radiation<strong>Radiation</strong> is also a strong part of the game, as it can be <strong>rewarding</strong> but can be quite <strong>opposite</strong> as well. Also it can stop the decaying of Sanity but as the Radiation is higher it will hurt you too! Since it is a big part we cannot reveal all of the effects of the radiation.<br/>Some <strong>effects</strong> of Radiation are:<br/><ul><li><strong>Slows</strong>, or stops sanity from decaying. Depends on the percentage of the radiation.<br/>Even with little radiation you lose bits of health. It depends on the percentage of the radiation.<br/></li><li><strong>40+ REMs</strong> - Occasionally image blurring, and noises in head.<br/></li><li><strong>85+REMs</strong> - Walk/Sprint a lot slower, bad reflexes, decreased hearing.</li></ul>Future Development<ul><li>Make the WCD a heavy impact on the game, by changing, adding or removing whole parts of the map.<br/></li><li>Add more effects to the Sanity [For instance: heavy blurring, flashbacks of past, etc.]<br/></li><li>Add more effects to the Health[For instance: Add a bleed feature, when low on hp, to fall down sometimes]<br/></li><li>Improve the A.I - I have a great idea for you and am developing it as we speak! It'll be a lot of fun [By fun I mean in your most immediate death]<br/></li><li>Implementing Physic Engine [Ability to drag objects, boxes etc.]<br/></li><li>Optimize and polish textures, models and UI<br/></li><li>More intractable objects and voice overs for characters<br/></li><li>A lot more to come! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb6d71dd43573905e94b50d62a5f7b0.jpg", "website": "http://www.intercido.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 105}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VisualTech48"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Intercido"], "esrb_rating": null}
