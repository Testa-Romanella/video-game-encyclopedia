Every enemy is different and they can even have some elemental weaknesses and strengths, such as fire, ice or thunder. Also, every turret is different as well, with different effects and stats such as power, range, speed, etc. Turrets can be upgraded even to some element force, or be sold. If too many enemies reach the main base, the game is over. There are infinite waves, with more and more powerful enemies each time. The map is poorly illuminated with a moving light that follows the player's cursor. The player is also able to zoom in and out the map, and move the field of view with WASD controls.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:49:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad05279048112dd00f5d0a08e6b4334c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antonio Marco Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
