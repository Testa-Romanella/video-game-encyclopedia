{"id": 508083, "slug": "numbers-only", "name": "Numbers Only!", "name_original": "Numbers Only!", "description": "<p>\"Numbers Only!\" is a game made for Trijam #91 where the theme was \"there is safety in numbers\". The goal was to create a game in within 3 hours, but I went 5 minutes\u00a0overtime. That's okay though, as it is alright for\u00a0you to go overtime in the jam\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>This game was a blast to make and I hope you will enjoy it\u00a0 :)</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Arrow keys / WASD: Move</p>\n<p>Z/Shift: Shoot a bullet</p>\r\nMechanics:\r\n<p>The mechanic of the game is to push blocks with only numbers (1) into the gap.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, blocks with either the number 1 or the letter A\u00a0 will appear. In order to achieve score, push the blocks with the number 1 into the gap at the bottom of the screen and push the blocks with the letter A out of the screen. You can also use your bullets to push blocks into the gap. If you do these things, then you will get 1 point :D</p>\n\n<p>You lose points when you either push blocks with the letter A into the gap or push blocks with the number 1 out of the screen. You will also lose one of your lives which are represented by hearts on the side of the screen. Lose all of your lives and it's game over!</p>\n\n<p>Good luck, and have fun playing!</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: All art and sounds were made by me.</p>\r\n\r\nThis game uses Godot Engine, available under the following license:\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2020 Juan Linietsky, Ariel Manzur.
