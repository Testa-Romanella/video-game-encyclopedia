Please don't be too strict with it. I tried to give a s gameboy style, and the main caracter is inspired by Mr Game and Watch.<br/>I also made a theme for my game, it's kinda rough, but it's my first original composition, so i guess that\u00a0i'm pretty proud of it, despite it's not incerdible.</p>\n<p>So be it, have fun !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/36382d9a42a238c7b6da8d64a48e19f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Luma2DS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
