As of yet the game is not finished and is still in the \"polishing\" phase where we sort out bugs and inconsistencies.</p><p><strong>The game:</strong><br/></p><p>Set in medieval Japan, this small hack &amp; slash narrative driven game will win your sword in the fight for justice!.</p><p>\r\n\tShogun 'Oda' has been ruling the land with an iron fist; any town or city that dares to refuse his terms gets wiped out. You play as Akio, a survivor of one of these attacks. Akio has declared vengence on Shogun Oda and will not rest until justice for his family and loved ones has been claimed. Akios long adventure leads him to the White Tigers, a rebellion filled with outlaws, Ronins and the like where he becomes one of them, learns their ways, trains how to fight, to one day fulfil his goal.</p><p><strong>Vertical slice:</strong><br/></p><p>\r\n\tThe game we have made starts the player in the Shogan's high mountain palace dungeons. You must break out, find your way to the Shoguns palace and claim justice for his crimes. </p><p>\r\n\tAfter playing, please fill out this feedback form so we can improve on the game: https://goo.gl/forms/LRX7nEiba7sXrndG3\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks\r\n</p><p>- Power Ninjas Studio Team</p><p>\r\n\tCONTROLS\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Movement: WASD / Left stick\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Camera: Mouse movement / Right stick\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Jump: Spacebar / \"A\" button.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Light attack: LMB / \"X\" button.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Heavy attack: RMB / \"B\" button.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Dodge: \"c\" / Right bumper\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t- Sprint: Shift / Left bumper<br/>\n</p><p>- Pause = \"Z\" / Start on controller</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tTHE TEAM MEMBERS\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tConnor Howells - Project Lead / Game Designer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDamien Stergio - Game Design\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tStefan Schaening - Programmer\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tJacquelyn Pennay - Animator\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMatt Fajardo - Animator\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMarkus Paasila - Animator\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tBen Read - VFX artist\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>Change log: Final Build</p><p>+ Game Finished</p><p>+ Final Additions to UI, Object placement and missing textures<br/></p><p>+ Values and balancing of Player and Enemies</p><p>+ Camera zoom and sensitivity tweaking</p><p>+ VFX changes</p><p>+ Game has slight glitch, when you reset you must press start and resume.</p><p>Changelog: Version 3.</p><p>+ Added less brutal AI</p><p>+ Lowered the size of tutorial Images.</p><p>+ Final boss has attack and damage sounds.</p><p>+ Adjusted lighting - Not complete.</p><p>+ Stopped the camera sensitivity from being twice as fast on the second level.</p><p>+ new object placements</p><p>Changelog: Version 2.</p><p>+ Main menu controller functionality (still WIP)</p><p>+ UI Updated</p><p>+ Colliders on crates</p><p>+ Colliders blocking the player through shortcuts</p><p>+ Fixed Infinite Jump on controller/</p><p>+ New Player Animations</p><p>+ New Player Attacking Functionality</p><p>+ Controller Re-mapped</p><p>+ New Enemy Animations</p><p>+ Enemy Implemented</p><p>+ Sounds implemented on various actions</p><p>+ Outside level object placement revamp</p><p>+ WIP - Lighting, Main cause of losing of frames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b76fe163f3b48c4f574e4da5282b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Power Ninja Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
