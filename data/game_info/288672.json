He spends most of his time in the various menus to plan shipping routes, buying new ships or repairing the old ones. There are also several other options available, e.g. advertising or taking a loan.</p>\n<p>Just like in the original the player has to manually dock in respectively out when reaching or leaving a harbour. Compared to the original arcade sequences this time it is focused on a realistic simulation of the ships. Optionally the player can also hire an expensive tugboat to do the job for him. There are also random happenings during transit, e.g. icebergs, rats on board or shipwrecked people, which partly also result in a simulation sequence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-31T18:35:44", "background_image": null, "website": "https://www.portsofcall.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["astragon Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
