Different targets are worth different amount of points. The player's gun is just a basic single-shot gun. The game also includes pickups for the player's health and ammo. Everything here was scripted myself.</p>\n<p>Note: The mouse controls in the WebGL player can be kind of wonky, but they work fine in the executable file.
