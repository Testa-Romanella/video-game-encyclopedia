You can play with the spacebar, mouse or touch depending on your preference.</p>\n<p>Tap your input to move accross the screen quickly, and hold and release your input to move accross slowly. It's a ridiculously simple game to learn, and incredibly hard to master.</p>\n<p>Pick up batteries whilst DrillBit is falling, don't let them run out! On your way you'll find a Magnet power-up to increase the area you can collect batteries in, and a Shield power-up to protect you from the next block that you hit.</p>\n<p>You'll get points for just surviving, and <strong>10X</strong> points for each remaining battery you have!</p><p>DrillBit was made by 1 tired man\u00a0for the GMTKjam 2019 in one weekend.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>All development was done by Tom Rhodes.
