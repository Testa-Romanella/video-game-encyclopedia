You are physically weak, and rely on your ability to shift your soul into other creatures. Exploit their abilities to solve puzzles, crush those who oppose you, and invoke in-fighting amongst their ranks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A 2.5 action platformer for PC, built in Unity.</p>\n<p>Shown at Level Up Showcase in Toronto and EGLX. Developed over the course of 7 months, with a group of 7.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What people have said</strong></p>\n<p>\"A puzzle platformer with a twist, as the way forward is found within your enemies! A unique concept that felt fun to play, and fun to puzzle out. Creating an interesting game demo and having it be fun within moments of grabbing a controller, especially during a busy event is hard but Godsend proved to be up to the task. I took no hints from the developer leading my demo (shoutout to\u00a0Coley!) and so I had a real sense of accomplishment finding all the shrines, though my time could have used some work. I fell an embarassing amount.\"</p>\n<p>Colin Cummings, Third Person<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07a/07a792f13eb9c6e9173f0487578df5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Patchwork Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
