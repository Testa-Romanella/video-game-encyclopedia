The Multiplayer Room has been deactivated due to a Bug that has clouded the feeling of the Game very much.\r\n \r\nYou can move around by quickly moving your controllers up and down. There are no other key assignments. You can activate the deactivated dice with your all-purpose tool.\r\nAfter you have opened the room on your left, you can teleport to the level available up to now via the teleporter. After choosing a level of difficulty, you have to try to run through the level. \r\nGood luck. \r\nI hope you like it and you have fun. \r\nUpdates such as Multiplayer and other Rooms will follow in the future.\r\nTested with Rift/RiftS and HTC Vive.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:28:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bae/baeba060d76c5fb06c98ab3b63fc06e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mendarion"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
