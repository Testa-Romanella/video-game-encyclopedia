Answer the prompts and share as intimately as you like while reading prompts that others shared with the world.<br/><br/>We wanted to make a game that expressed how we deal with depression and anxiety and we came to the conclusion that talking and writing about our problems helps us tackle them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a team, we turned that concept into an interactive experience with our\u00a0game where you can take a prompt and share it with other players. You can also collect players' bottles and read their prompts to gain a different person's point of view.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a game about discussing tough topics and sharing them with people in hopes to show support and expressing yourself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T10:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f3734451fb4ad29833328069f4e91ca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zrrz111", "Wollemo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
