The very first ever title for \"The\u00a0Power Shed\". It is a pretty insane party game challenge, which features fast-paced game play and also quality samples). Well, sort of.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play<br/></strong>This is a casual hi-score challenging game. We have tossed a rocket into space, and it is up to you to pilot it safely for as long as you possibly can. Watch out for the deadly asteroids, otherwise your rocket is finished. <br/><br/>Keep on playing for as long as you can and try to beat your previous hi-score. Like I have been struggling to :)<br/><br/><strong>Controls<br/><br/></strong>Use joystick port 2 left / right to move rocket (and hope you survive for as long as you can).<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/><br/></strong>Programming by\u00a0<strong>DJ Trumpet (Ryxx)<br/></strong>Sampling by\u00a0<strong>DJ Trumpet\u00a0</strong><br/>Music by\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Tape Loader by\u00a0<strong>Martin Piper\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Richard Bayliss<br/><br/>(C)2017 The Power Shed</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:16:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61e/61eb7080dcef270546edfdad2846de06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
