The player will need to pass the start/finish line to start each new lap, and will also need to pass through the two checkpoints set around the track for each lap, to prevent the player from cheating by crossing the start/finish line repeatedly without driving around the whole track.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Controls:</p>\n<p>Accelerate W/Up\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turn Left A/Left\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turn Right D/Right\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brake SpaceBar\u00a0</p>\n<p>Handbrake S/Down</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T13:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c103a53c8e30f0a5df08c443b9e91d2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MartinFlannery"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
