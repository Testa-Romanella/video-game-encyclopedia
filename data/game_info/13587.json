I'm not going to tell you how to do that. Good luck.<br/><br/>Also, there's apparently a game mode where you've got one minute to hit them through hoops for points and stuff. That's included in case people don't understand how fun just hitting beach balls around it. It keeps score for about 100 or 200 of your rounds (but doesn't save it!) in case you want to run it at a party and track high scores. Oh, did I mention that if you can use telekinetic powers in it, you can wow your friends?<br/><br/>There is also a host of buttons active on your keyboard for messing with whoever is in VR. Send the beach balls on the attack! Toggle gravity. Make 'em a giant! Pop all their beach balls! (No! Don't be a picklepuss!) Drop huge beach balls on their heads! <br/><br/>FAQ:Why pizza peels?I like pizza. Also, they're great for reach out really far and hitting things.

They'll head off planet in search of dull worlds in need of fun. The static electricity given off by beach balls may cause a spike in microburst storm systems. Sadly, 1% of beach balls are anti-social, and often leave. It's pretty hard to have more than 100 beach balls. We're working on bringing out the best in every beach ball, and some day, hope to have tons of 'em!Why are the clouds eating my beach balls?Fredricko the Cloud believes that due to the non-biodegradable nature of beach balls, it's his duty to clean up after anyone who's made too many beach balls. He's also hungry. He's the one by the small hill, not to be confused with Gerando or Luis.What's the Difference between seated / standing / roomscale?Beach balls come to you. Standing / Room Scale affords a little more space.How do I get more Beach Balls?Look at the paddles! They've got buttons everywhere! Push the buttons!
