(Demo 2)", "description": "<p>A 3D tower defence game.</p>\n<p>In Corporate Wars - Data Breach!, you are employed by the Despai Corporation to watch over a particular location at night. Working remotely, you control a ceiling cam to monitor and interract with your assigned location.</p>\n<p>Your peaceful night is disrupted by the arrival of data carriers from an enemy organisation. They're here to  try and steal sensitive information from the Despai Corporation's servers.  You must act quickly and place turrets to destroy the data carriers before they can escape.<br/></p>\n<p>You have no choice but to try your best, as everyone knows that the Despai Corporation loves success, but takes a dim view of failure... Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>This demo version includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Character selection with bonus Trait</li><li>Initially, one type of Standard turret</li><li>Two more turrets unlockable with Experience</li><li>Turret reloading</li><li>Seven campaign levels</li><li>Unlimited level replays</li></ul>\n\r\nFull Game Early Access\r\n<p>If you would be interested in a discounted early access version of the full game, please indicate this in the comments.<br/></p>\n\r\nPlatform Support\r\n<p>Windows 10 only</p>\n\r\nMinimum System Requirements\r\n<ul><li>Intel i5 or equivalent</li><li>8GB \u00a0RAM</li><li>6GB Hard Disk Space (12GB if unzipping both packages)</li><li>For the Standard variant, a reasonably recent graphics card</li><li>For systems without a discrete graphics card or if the Standard version displays a blank screen, use the OpenGL variant instead</li></ul>\n\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Two .zip files are available: one containing the Standard version (uses Vulkan) and one containing the OpenGL version. Simply unzip the contents in the desired location, then run the .exe file to start the game.<br/></p>\n\r\nMade in Godot 4 (Beta) and Notes on Workarounds\r\n<p>Corporate Wars - Data Breach! takes advantage of the new Navigation system in Godot 4. This provides the enemies with dynamic pathfinding, making each play through of a particular level a little bit different.\u00a0However, at the time of writing, Navigation in Godot 4 Beta has been flagged as \"experimental\", which can be seen by occasional odd behaviour of the enemies. One of these oddities is when enemies get stuck in one place. This has been turned into a \"feature\", where enemies will self destruct if they get stuck for too long.</p>\n<p>You may also find that occasionally some or all of the enemies start spinning on the spot. If this happens, simply wait until they start moving again. If they do this in range of any of your turrets, they make easy targets!<br/></p>\n\r\nOther Known \"Features\"\r\n<ul><li>Crash on exiting levels:<ul><li>After completing or quitting a level, sometimes the game crashes. However, the game will be saved, so simply restart the game and click the Continue button . If this crash re-occurs on the next session, it is recommended to wait a little while so that Windows does some memory cleanup, before starting the game again.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Debug Mode:<ul><li>You will probably notice that the game \u00a0title is appended by (Debug) in the title bar. This because the game will not work if it is exported with Debug switched off and it can be safely ignored.</li></ul></li><li>Lighting glitches:<ul><li>The lighting sometimes glitches in the Standard build, especially when there are a lot of enemies in one area. This appears to be a problem in Godot core, so hopefully this will be fixed before too long.</li><li>The Iighting inconsistent lighting in the OpenGL build . This is because OpenGL support is new in Godot 4 Beta at the time of writing.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The demo will be updated if any Godot 4 beta drops help with any of these issues.<br/></p>\n\r\nCymbalis YouTube Channel\r\n<p>Cymbalis on YouTube<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d27e3e673a9405d26c9f1000a3b3c72d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cymbalis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
