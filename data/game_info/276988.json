Keep the bomb in frame by swiping it to juggle it. Each juggle gets you a point. If the bomb touches any side of your device (top, bottom, left, or right), the bomb explodes and you lose. Compete with your friends and the rest of the world to see who can get the highest score!<br/><br/>BomBop is completely free and always will be completely free. No in-app purchases ever.<br/><br/>Go to our official Facebook or Twitter for more information and updates:<br/>Facebook: www.facebook.com/bombopgame<br/>Twitter: www.twitter.com/BomBopGame<br/><br/>Credits:<br/>Programmer: Michael Rutledge<br/>Artist: Jake Nunes<br/>Publisher: High Development Mobile Applications Inc.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8e867d66d1074eaf2e2d4bd04f25868_ZjDXuFg.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["High Development Mobile Applications"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["High Development Mobile Applications"], "esrb_rating": null}
