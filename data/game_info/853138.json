So, every projectile that does go out of bounds, is seen as an act of war!</p>\n<p><strong>PLAY!</strong><br/>Because of the scoreboard system, this game is hosted on my own website. The source-code is oploaded on this itch page :-)<br/>Play here (original submission): https://wouter52.com/PROJECTS/VJ03_INTERSTELLAR_STRUGGLE</p>\n<p>=============================================<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Theme: Turn up the heat</strong><br/>Everytime a projectile goes out of bounds, a neighbouring planet will see this as an act of war and will fire their own projectiles. The war gets hotter and hotter!<br/><br/><strong>Focus: multi-use</strong><br/>Your shield also acts like the base for the weapon. A hole in your defense means a place you can't use your missile. Which makes the game even harder.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Graphics: all made by myself.<br/>Sounds: all generated with: https://sfxr.me/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T09:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f95bb7f04e95d663c6ef9c36dc8f12fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wouter52"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
