A player agrees to a contract, purchases resources and the managed workers work to fulfill that contract. The player has the option to make their workers more comfortable to improve efficiency, or pay them more to increase worker happiness. However, the overseer corporation always demands larger and larger profits, and so balancing these becomes the core of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5b6581c5d9384ce22bf51e7d18578bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DivisionOfLabour"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
