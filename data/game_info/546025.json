{"id": 546025, "slug": "carrot-topped", "name": "Carrot Topped", "name_original": "Carrot Topped", "description": "<p>This game was created for the 2021 Community Jam under the theme of 'Uncontrollable Fate'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our goal for this game jam was to create a simple, replayable game and focus on polishing the game as much as possible. As we were able to get the core mechanics created relatively quickly, we were able to repeatedly test the game and tweak the gameplay so that it feels solid. It also gave us the time to integrate a leaderboard system so that you can pit yourself against everyone else for the top spot.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is always welcome and we look forward to seeing you in the leaderboards!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>(Also compatible with Xbox gamepad)</p>\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<ul><li>Some players on the computer builds may experience the character moving without any input. Please check if you have a controller plugged in as this is likely to be causing the issue.</li><li>There is an exploit that allows you to get behind the Face and keep running unchallenged. As we can't fix that issue just yet, all I can ask is that you don't post to the leaderboards if you do this. Scout's honour!</li></ul>\n\r\nCreated By EyeDoll Interactive:\r\n<p>Albi -\u00a0https://albigames.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Ermdad -\u00a0https://ermdad.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T07:08:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed96cff6799090b2453a8e039d4c67d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Ermdad", "Albi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
