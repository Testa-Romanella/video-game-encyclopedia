{"id": 428281, "slug": "end-of-war-1945", "name": "End of War 1945", "name_original": "End of War 1945", "description": "<strong>Core and Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>End of War returns to a more classic, but not too old school style of casual first person shooters. The focus isn't on e-sports, but on the average player. The core of the gameplay experience is engaging, easy to understand, but fun and chaotic, like shooters of the late 00s. End of War focuses on gameplay and setting above all else. The setting guides the gameplay, an aspect some recent arcade style WW2 shooters overlook. The guns you use feel rugged, like they're really from 1945 (But they still pack quite a punch). The maps are based on real locations, so they don't feel \"overly designed\" specifically to be an FPS map. Yet they've been tweaked to work with the gameplay. These maps also focus on a more open feel, you'll have lots of room to move around and be creative in your strikes. The combat of the maps is focused less on narrow shootouts, and more on controlling key points and using the features of each map to your advantage. There's also no kill streaks, or fancy equipment. It's the players, guns, and grenades. The early access release will have a variety of game modes that take advantage of the setting, more details will be revealed on these soon. The gametypes include classics like Free for All, Team Deathmatch, Conquest, Capture the Flag ,and Sabotage. New variants built for this game's setting include Target, Elimination, Uprising and Sabotage. All with a core focus of 6v6 or 12 player instant action.<br/><br/><strong>New and Rare Perspectives</strong><br/><br/>If you\u2019re tired of games depicting the same battles focused on D-Day and other areas of France, this is the game for you. At launch into early access, a variety of battles are there to be fought. You\u2019ll be taken to Yugoslavia, witnessing as the local partisan resistance becomes dominant over the desperate Axis occupiers. The main focus placed on the retreat of Axis forces, and the partisans inflicting revenge on them. You\u2019ll fight in the remnants of Fascist Italy, and the last defenses of the German Reich in the west. Focusing on forgotten battles that merely prolonged an inevitable defeat, with deadly cost. You\u2019ll take part in battles that took place over a week after the war in Europe was supposed to have ended. And after launch, many new locations will be added, with new factions as well. The Italians, Soviets, and Japanese forces are planned to be added into the game, after the initial early access release. The Soviets and Italians will likely come before the Japanese, but an unexplored theatre of East Asia will be in the game before it leaves Early Access. At launch, the German, American, and Yugoslav Partisans will be fully playable.<br/><br/><strong>Environment and Setting</strong><br/><br/>If you want a World War 2 shooter that returns to more casual gameplay, while also providing an immersive historical experience, you\u2019ll get it here. The environments and locations are based on real battlefields. Walking through a destroyed village, bunker complex, or defensive line has meaning from the context surrounding it. All while providing interesting routes to move, relying on quick strategy from you and your team to overpower your enemy.  As mentioned before, the setting and gameplay are intertwined. For example, the STG44 will only have two magazines available when you spawn with it. This works for balance reasons, and also fits the setting due to ammo shortages for less common weapons at the time. But the only respectful way to depict World War 2, is by not holding back and showing it as truly as possible. You\u2019ll see Germany\u2019s fanaticism on full display as they make their final stand in a long lost war. Crumbled buildings as the radios broadcast real propaganda music and messages, appearing on the specific dates and battles they did 75 years ago. Each side has character, the World War 2 setting means more than the guns and uniforms you\u2019ll encounter. There will be no distracting and unrealistic weapon skins either. You won\u2019t find an MP40 painted purple here. What you will find is a raw atmosphere of the end of the war. The events depicted may be unsettling, but it was an unsettling time that all forms of media must show authentically.  <br/><br/>The maps themselves all have history to them, and players can explore them to see the context surrounding the battle taking place. Hopefully you can learn something by researching them further, the Yugoslav front is especially unexplored in most media. It's very interesting and worth a look. 5 (6 if development is ahead of schedule) of the maps in the initial release are set in Italy and Yugoslavia (Yugoslav Partisans vs Germany) and 3 are set in Western Germany (US vs Germany) <br/><br/>Everything about End of War is being built with the feeling of getting the atmosphere right, including the audio.  Generic action music is never going to used, only appropriate music for each faction or the time period. Each song has history as to why it's there, and playing when it is.  The weapon sounds provide not only the correct sound, but the feel with every shot. <br/><br/><strong>How many maps will be playable at Early Access launch?</strong><br/><br/>8 maps will be ready by the time of End of War's early access debut, currently 5 of these maps are developed and ready. Additional maps are already planned for the current factions, and more will be added to accompany the Soviet, Italian, and Japanese entry into the game.   <br/><br/><strong>What about visual customization?</strong><br/><br/>Unless the community really demands it, there likely won't be any at early access launch. Each map's units are accurate to that particular event, so character customization wouldn't really fit for the most part. As said before, no purple MP40s or anything of that nature.  If the community really demands it, maybe some tasteful skins like a Yugoslav weapon with communist slogans written on it can be made.  For now though, the answer is no.  Some players buy these to support further development. If you want to do that, awesome! Gifting a game key to a friend would be the best way! It helps our community grow, and then you can play together too.<br/><br/><strong>How can I help support further development?</strong><br/><br/>Right now, the best way to do that is to <strong>add our game to your wishlist here on Steam</strong> <br/><br/>Stand by, for more information on crowd funding opportunities in future announcements.<br/><br/><strong>Can my PC run this game?</strong><br/><br/>End of War is being built with low end optimization in mind, while also looking sharp for players with higher end systems. Powered by Unreal Engine 4, there's amazing potential in what can be depicted on screen. End of War can't promise the most stunning visuals compared to AAA shooters, but it's enough for the environments to immerse you. But if you're on an older or lower end system, a smooth experience is still possible with sacrifice to visual quality. It's important for fair competition, but also to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone. <br/><br/><strong>Will you have bot support?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, bots are available in our Early Access release. <br/><br/><strong>When is this releasing into Early Access?</strong><br/><br/>End of War 1945 is coming to PC Early Access on May 8th 2020.
