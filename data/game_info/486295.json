It is my first project on this page and as a beginner in game development who has done this for only a few months, I hope more experienced developers will be able to give me a few tips.</p>\n<p>Find the Diamond is a game where the player travels through a random generated dungeon and has to find the diamond at the end. The room in which the diamond is located is also random. Due to a mistake of mine I wasn't able to fix in three days, it is possible that the diamond is located within the start room. In this case, restarting should solve the problem.</p>\n<p>This game can be played with both controller and keyboard.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:(Keyboard/X-Box Controller)</p>\n<p>Escape/Select: Going back to the start scrren or quitting the game</p>\n<p>WASD/Joystick: Moving</p>\n<p>Space/X-Button: Sword Swing</p>\n<p>Enter/Start: Pausing</p>\n<p>Potions who appear sometimes after defeating all enemies in one room and the diamond can be collected by walking into them.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game in advance and have fun :)</p>\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<ul><li>Download .zip file</li><li>Place in a folder on you desktop</li><li>Right click &gt; Extract Here</li><li>Double click on Find The Diamond.exe</li><li>Enjoy</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f70/f7010a52a655531d17f1399708991518.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["abocado"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
