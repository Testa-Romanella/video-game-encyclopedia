That ends my platform-streak this fall, now back to submachine\u2026<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mission to Saturn, August 2nd, 2008:</strong></p>\n<p>Now this one is an interesting case of reloading taken to the extreme. You might not\u00a0 recognize this, but this game is based on Mars Rider. The only thing that survived the reloading is that rainbow in the background. Everything else is sparkling new and I must say that this game is one of my most advanced engines ever. Jumping, shooting, dodging, fighting enemies and bosses? Not enough? Ok, how about an interlevel workshop where you can improve every single feature of your vehicle. That\u2019s right. Now play.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mission to Jupiter, December 21st, 2008:</strong></p>\n<p>The green alien is back! Now going to explore the rings of Jupiter. Seems like those green gems that are in every game since the Mars adventure are kindof important to those alien guys. So go get them.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mission to Uranus, March 21, 2012:</strong></p>\n<p>The alien returns. The mission remains. Explore the solar system. Today it\u2019s tuesday, which means time for Uranus mission. Collect fuel and gems for points, get through all 20 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Mission to Mercury, August 25th, 2012:</strong></p>\n<p>A short trip down the memory lane. First of all this game sports the most classic \u201cskutnik\u201d gameplay. Falling coins, 30-second timer and time power-ups. Just like in good old 2004 when the squirrels started jumping on my screen. Other thing is that I created this gameplay in 2008 and it was just sitting there on my hard drive for the past four years. Since we\u2019re in a purge-all year \u2013 the game is finally out. Funny thing \u2013 I called this movement engine wii, because how you have to swing the landing pad to steer the alien. Anyways. Enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mission to Venus</strong> and <strong>Mission to Neptune</strong>\u00a0were not programmed by me, therefore I don't have source files for those two games.\u00a0This is why they're in swf format, I can't convert them to .exe files.\u00a0This is also why there's still original branding present in those games.\u00a0I guess that's a sign of the times in some way still. They open straight into fullscreen, you can exit them by pressing alt+F4.</p>\n<p><strong>Last two games in the series\u00a0</strong>were not created in Flash, but in Game Maker Studio.
