But it's going to be a rough night - because all of their emergency vehicles are out of commission.</p>\n<p>As a phone operator, use nothing but your voice to help the citizens of Walden (and your company) to survive a night without the assistance of emergency vehicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-About the game-</p>\n<p>This is our third game jam. We wanted to try two new things for this jam - A fully voice-acted game, and Comedy.</p>\n<p>As with every jam, we would've loved to put more content in the game. Some of our less-funny content made it in, and some of our more-funny content didn't. And of course, much of it was rushed!</p>\n<p>You'll find a fair share of typos and mistakes, including our broken and unfinished testing phone call that we decided to include last-minute for more content (definitely a poor choice!).</p>\n<p>But we're proud of what we got done, and hopefully you can have a few laughs in this non-typical experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T12:00:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a8c3f20e7e717b2e6336cf4b1c9f61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hanushi", "JadonTheDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
