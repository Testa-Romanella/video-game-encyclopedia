This is a prototype. It is very buggy still, but should be playable through a battle. <br/><br/>To play, select either an attack card or defend card. For attack cards you then select an enemy. Then press the red button. You can play 3 cards a turn before your energy runs out and it is the enemy's turn.<br/><br/>Known issues:<br/>The shields visuals will not turn off after shields lowering to 0(for both player and enemy).<br/>Ending gate is all jacked up.<br/>Sometimes attack cards don't reset correctly.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>Most assets are from GamedevHQ's Filebase.
