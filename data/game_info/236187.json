Remove gems from the board by lining up five gems of the same colour in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction. Testing wits and reflexes, more gems are added after every move, forcing you to think ahead to stop the board from filling up. Use special power-ups to help you along, and play through numerous gem packed levels as you try your hardest to master the game.  <br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>* Highly addictive lines style puzzle game play.<br/>* Lots of beautiful gem graphics<br/>* Two game modes; Classic and Arcade<br/>* Special power ups and timed pieces.<br/>* Two methods for moving the pieces on the board; Tap-Tap and Drag-And-Drop.<br/>* Undo bad moves, you can even go right back to the start of the game!<br/>* Easy to learn, yet hard to master. <br/>* Easy mode in the early levels to help new players get used to the game play. <br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>The game starts with a 9\u00d79 board with three gems chosen out of seven different colours. The player can move one gem per turn, and the player may only move a gem to a particular place if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells) between the current position of the gem and the desired destination. The goal is to remove gems by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five gems of the same colour (four in the early levels). If the player does manage to form a line of at least four/five gems of the same colour, the gems in those lines are removed, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another gem. If not, three new gems are added, and the game continues until the board is full. <br/><br/>Gems are moved by selecting a gem and dragging it to an empty square on the board. Alternatively, you can tap to select a gem and then tap on the target board square. Tap again on a selected gem to unselect.<br/><br/>There is an 'undo' button if you make a bad move and should you wish, you can even undo all the way back to the start of the game!<br/><br/>ARCADE MODE<br/><br/>This mode has special pieces and power ups that will help you complete the game:<br/><br/>Timed Piece<br/>The Timed Piece has a counter that counts down each time the player takes a turn. The counter starts at nine and counts down to zero.

Line up six pieces of the same colour to spawn a multicolour piece.<br/><br/>Bomb Piece<br/>The bomb piece will clear a 3x3 area around it.
