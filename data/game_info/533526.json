I\u00a0did playtest it to try and turn off the left button,\u00a0I\u00a0hope this doesn't get me kicked out of the club.)</li><li>Two Buttons Game Jam (Right to walk right, z to interact.\u00a0Note: it's actually a three-button game- I figured out how to turn off every other button, but\u00a0you can still walk left.\u00a0You can solve this problem by simply not walking left. I\u00a0also started making this before this specific jam started, but that's okay because I\u00a0do whatever I want. It only took like three hours total anyway. Two of them were spent puzzling over how to make you not able to walk left. I\u00a0gave up.)</li></ul>\n<p>If you are running a jam and have an issue with me submitting weird stuff have you tried not doing that.\u00a0I\u00a0would make this one playable in the browser but it would fuck up the ending. Also it might break your browser I haven't tested it and I don't want to.\u00a0if you want to play this on linux, it will cost money</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6ed01b7db6ec504f1d52fe666c5d786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheChatotMaestro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
