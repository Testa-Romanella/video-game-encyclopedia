You have randomly set goals from collecting coins, to getting to an exit, and getting a key to unlock the exit. You have to complete these objectives with as many points as possible and you gain points for adding things.</p>\n<p>You will start in edit mode.\u00a0When In edit mode, use arrows to move the camera around, add platforms or turrets using right click. Use 1 to select the platforms. Use 2 to select the rotating turret. Use 3 to select the static turret. Click Tab to finish editing and to switch to playing.</p>\n<p>Platforms give you 1 point. Static turrets are 3 points. Rotating turrets are 5 points. But be careful, removing things cost more points than placing them. And having negative points ends your game.</p>\n<p>While playing, use arrows to control the character. You can also climb on on walls by jumping next to them and you can gain a lot of height!</p>\n<p>Please enjoy our short mediocre game\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>This is our first game jam and I\u2019m plenty happy with the result despite how much of a mess it is :)<br/></p>\n<p>Note: There are some known bugs that are being worked on. Though we can't update until after the voting period. If you encounter a game breaking bug at any time, please just restart the game. We thought this bug was fixed but apparently not.\u00a0Thank you for your understanding.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/666/666139258739d87129dccc67f8610d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Floor Tentacles Devs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
