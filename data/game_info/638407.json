The roads may not be the best, there may be a few accidents and inconveniences along the way, but the most important thing is that you make it to work intact.</p>\n\n<p>The game will be composed of <strong>multiple levels</strong> which are designed to be somewhat <strong>challenging but not rage-inducing</strong>. We want you to have a good experience \ud83e\udd70.</p>\n<p>These levels will have different settings, so one might be in outer space where you only see asteroids and far away planets, and the next might be in a populated intergalactic trading centre...</p>\n<p>I plan to add a cosmetic shop where you will be able to buy objects to make Gus look just how you want. For this, you will need to use the collectables that are found in the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong>\u00a0https://twitter.com/TreeNexus</p>\n<p><strong>Instagram:</strong>\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/treenexus/</p>\n<p><strong>Kickstarter:\u00a0</strong>tinyurl.com/nexustree</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T07:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22b615addac81c4940185a4cb1b5af06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NexusTree"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
