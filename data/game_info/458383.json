During the Summer of 2020, The New Dimension is pleased to announce a complete full game in the works with a proper loading bitmap, title screen and different sub level screens to play on each level.\u00a0 Granny's Teeth is finally going to become a full game. BUT - For now, you can download 4K Craptastic compo version of the game and have a laugh. <br/></p>\n<p>Poor old Granny. She was looking after her grandchildren until it was bed time. She gently tucked them in to bed, and went to bed herself - dropping the false teeth into a glass by her bed side. Alas, the next morning comes by. Granny wakes up and finds that her teeth are missing. It turns out that the children got up early and played hide and seek with them and chucked the teeth in to a fish bowl. The kids also ransacked Granny's house. Raffles the dog has been set loose, and Tiddles, the cat is on the prowl. ... and who let that toy plane, spider and giant wasp in to the house? Also little did Granny know was that her house was built above a swimming pool.<br/><br/>Your task is to help poor old Granny retrieve her teeth by locating them from the fish bowl. Watch out for the animals and insects, and other hazards. If you hit any hazards, you will lose a life and be thrown back to the start of each level. <br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>[4K Craptastic version]<br/></p>\n<p>Programming and idea: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics: <strong>Saul Cross<br/></strong>Music programming: <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong><br/></p>\n<p>(C)2016 The New Dimension as Public Domain software<br/></p>\n<p>[Free Full 2020 version - Currently in development - Not yet released]</p>\n<p>Programming and idea: <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>Graphics: <strong>Saul Cross</strong><br/>Music: ???????<br/>Tape loader: <strong>Martin Piper </strong>and <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/><br/></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:39:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c89/c89592b0e0c8d945f2477d7717973c86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
