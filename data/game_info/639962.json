It's your task to Re-Pair them, while making sure that different robot pairs don't collide! But these robots have a mind of their own: you cannot steer them, only repair the roads they traverse and try to guide them in the right direction. All the while the clock is ticking, because the robots won't stand still... <br/></p>\n<p>Try to complete as many levels as possible, maximizing your score, before your inevitable failure. :-) <br/></p>\n<p>This is an extended version of our Global Game Jam 2020 game, which is the most popular game of its jam site: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/robot-re-pair-3 <br/></p>\n<p>It has two different single player modes, and two multiplayer modes (cooperative and versus). It can be played with keyboard, controllers (Windows only, with XBOX compatible controllers), and touch screen (no multiplayer, obviously). <br/></p>\n<p>If you played this, please leave a comment, a rating and/or follow us.
