This experience was created as a graduate Project/Portfolio course final project by Rocky Hernandez.</p><p>This game features two endings, puzzle/problem solving, out of the box thinking. The game was designed to give as little information as possible and nudge you slightly in the right direction. I am very interested to see what endings you get.</p>\n<p>Here are the controls:</p>\n<p>W/A/S/D: Movement</p>\n<p>Q/E: Lean</p><p>Left Mouse: Primary interact (using, opening, on, off)</p><p>Right Mouse: Secondary Interact (Unlocking, pick up object, etc)</p>\n<p>Space: Jump</p>\n<p>CTRL: Crouch</p>\n<p>Tab: Open Inventory</p>\n<p>1: Pistol</p>\n<p>2/G: Glowstick</p>\n<p>3/F: Flashlight</p>\n<p>4/V: Lighter</p>\n<p>5/T: Torch</p>\n<p>6/N: NVG (Night Vision Goggles)</p>\n<p>7/C: Camera</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This projects goal was to amplify my experience with using the Unreal Engine and to design/develop something new for my portfolio. I will be developing more onto this in the near future.</p>\n<p>Tools/Assets used: Unreal Engine 4.24.3, Mixamo, Horror Engine asset, and Modular Victorian House asset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/19590eeaa2fe0f5879ceb34384193f85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rockyh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
