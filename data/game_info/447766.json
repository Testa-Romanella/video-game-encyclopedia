Worked more on the city at the end, unfortunately wall running is no longer in the game.</p>\n<p><strong>It is now working! I fixed the error. If you are struggling to make a jump, if you hold w and a at the same time when you run you will run faster and jump higher!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is the very early version of Urban Run. Just want to let you know that I got the trees and plants from two different creates on the assets store. They looked good and they were free so I got them so I take no credit for the trees or plants. And the materials and textures are from Wild Textures, again not mine.\u00a0 Ok, that's the credits out of the way,\u00a0Thanks for playing. There are heaps of bug because it is new, if you find any please tell me and also, I will update this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions: Mouse to look around, wasd to move, space to jump, r to reset.</p>\n\n<p>Plants, Rocks, logs, grass models, mushrooms and some trees by JustCreate</p>\n<p>Most of the trees by darthArtisian or something. (probably spelled that wrong sorry)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab1ee3380be52daa9bf297066cb3a536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DomDev1"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
