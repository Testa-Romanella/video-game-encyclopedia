These are Portals! <br/></p>\n<p>There are balls of two colors - the blue and the red ones. <br/></p>\n<p>Players should pocket balls into the portals with the respective color, the red into the red, the blue into the blue. <br/></p>\n<p>After every shot, the portals randomly change their positions in the pockets. <br/></p>\n<p>\r\nIf a player pockets a ball into the correct portal, the player gets 3 points. <br/></p>\n<p>Otherwise, if a player pockets a ball into the incorrect portal, the opponent gets 3 points. <br/></p>\n<p>If there is no collision between the cue ball and any object balls, the opponent gets 1 point. <br/></p>\n<p>If the cue ball pocketed into any portal, it appears at a random position of the start area,\r\nand the next shot goes to the opponent. <br/></p>\n<p>If all balls are pocketed, the player with more points wins. <br/></p>\n<p>If the score is equal, the additional red ball appears at the start position to play.\r\n</p>\r\nVersions\r\n<p>There are two versions of the game: the Demo and the Full.\r\n</p>\r\nDemo\r\n<p>The Demo-version is free.
