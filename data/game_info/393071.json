The story follows a young man trying to escape while being held captive in his own house. Unbeknownst to him, his family has secrets that he has to uncover in order to stay alive.</p>\n<p>The project was\u00a0created using conventional filmmaking practices and then developed using Unity. Unlike most interactive films where the viewer is able to pick only between two options, The Invasion provides the viewer with more agency and paths.<br/><br/>The proof of concept was showcased at META, an art exhibition in Toronto, to acclaim for its novelty and non-linear writing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:27:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f69f64845a401b27a435364565c2a5f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sahillulla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
