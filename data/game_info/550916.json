It is about the crack between two races;\u00a0humans and gremlins, and about fixing society and making sacrifices. It has little or no combat. You are a knight who wants glory by slaying the gremlin general. But you may understand his side. He just wants a place in society, but he is outcast. Enter a Mage who was outcast from the city due to a misunderstanding originating with you, the knight. Try to make friends, or alternatively--kill him and kill the gremlin general, and get all the glory possible.<br/></strong>\n<strong>More of this game and world will come in the near future.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T07:39:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f677f41c50587e5c04d2716cc68fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Future Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
