However, by using a wide variety of skills, they can control the battle situation as they wish.<br/>The support is the key to the game plan, sometimes protecting the attacker and sometimes paving the way for the attacker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this tag-team battle, it is difficult to win by one person's strength alone.
