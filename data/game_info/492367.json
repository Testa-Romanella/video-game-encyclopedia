Well, in these procedurally generated levels, you will never quite collect every pellet that exists, though you may try to consume as many as possible. How long can you out manoeuvre the constant stream of ghosts\u00a0before your inevitable demise?</p>\n<p>This uses original 80s PAC-MAN sprites to retain the arcade feel. It's quite fast paced with AI ghosts closing in every step with little time to react when they cross your path. The aim is to get as many points as possible before a ghost catches you, with pellets, power pellets, and cherries providing these points. Utilising the power pellet combo is the fastest way to obtain points, as the points gained from each ghost killed will increase with\u00a0each\u00a0subsequent kill, within the power pellet duration. \u00a0Also, there are some gamerules you can unlock to change things up a bit.\u00a0Other than that, there's not much else to it, so have fun!</p>\n<p>This was originally made in a two day game jam at Warwick Game Design, and it has been worked for additional time afterwards\u00a0for a few new features, and\u00a0a polished itch.io upload.</p>\n<p>Created by: Joseph Murphy and Michael Tyler.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1d209e71b7ac7f734007e17f602c43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Joseph28"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
