You can shoot a spread of bullets that contains as many bullets as your value. Larger spreads lower the amount of necessary accuracy, but a focused spread offers high damage and a high reward. Will you take your chances on a single shot?\u00a0Beware though, getting hit or dashing creates enough force to roll your die to a different face, making you need to change your playstyle quickly and often.</p><p>Use WASD or arrows to move, Space to dash, and left click to shoot. P to pause.</p><p>The game will start quickly, so make sure to click on the game or use full screen so input will register. Press P if you need a second to think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84f/84f1bb027a1fab7eafb1491d17d6f947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SlightlyBurntWaffles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
