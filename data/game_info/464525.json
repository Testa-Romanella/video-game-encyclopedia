You then have access to one of their powers for a certain duration. You can see what kind of ability (movement or offense) they possess by holding down shift (which also slows down time).</p>\n<p>We didn't manage to create a fully fledged level, so this is only a single room in which you can play around with the ability stealing mechanics.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Move : WASD</p>\n<p>- Attack : Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>- Steal Ability : Right Mouse Button</p>\n<p>- Jump / Fly : Spacebar</p>\n<p>- Slow Down Time : Shift</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:30:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bf/3bfbd7c6af67e66847218ee89657304f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kami Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
