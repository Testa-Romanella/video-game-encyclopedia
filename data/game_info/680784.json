My game is where you shuffle the pieces and build a score meter by completing objectives like score, time, and collective objectives. This game took me 15-20 hours to produce. I started with a blank Unity project and learn important fundamental skills to create my own tile-based match-three game. To do this, I created loads of C# scripts to organise my scripts logically and efficiently. To set up my project settings and my environment I had to create a board class to store my tile and game pieces; create an auto-centred orthographic camera; produce a GamePiece class that moves the interpolation; set up the tiles to include mouse input; search for 2D array matches; handle recursive calls to refill and clear my board. Adding sound effects is crucial for any game and applying particle effects to add more realism to Color Bomb. I wanted to make a score manager so I can track my progress and complete the level in the fastest time. This game levelled my Unity skills to make more games in the future!</p><p>Controls: Hold left click to drag colours to match three in a row!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d74b0ce89b07710bad5d9a65d8b9806c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
