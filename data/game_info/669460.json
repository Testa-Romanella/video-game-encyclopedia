Equipped with an old (but reliable) ship and scanner, it's finally time to embark on that journey.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>One thing you'll never fail to find in space is asteroids - lots of asteroids. While most people find them to be obtrusive hazards, they are instead troves of hidden treasure. Whether you'll discover a cluster of rare\u00a0<em>Amorium\u00a0</em>crystals or stumble upon some \"local\" wildlife such as a\u00a0<em>Terrapuffer</em>, every asteroid holds the potential for new knowledge and riches. Scan each one for signs of life, and you may just find creatures that are out of this world!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Asteroid Archiver</strong>\u00a0is a casual space adventure game about exploring the universe to archive all of the strange and wonderous things you come across. Navigate the galaxy with your spacecraft to locate asteroids to scan and mine. Once mining, do your best to keep the cursor stabilized on the innermost rings to uncover the secrets at the core of each asteroid. And of course, be careful to monitor your ship's energy levels so they don't get too low from all that exploring. Developed in 55 hours for a game jam competition, this game features all original graphics and code made during that time period.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\r\n</p>\n<p>If you enjoy\u00a0<strong>Asteroid Archiver</strong>\u00a0or have any thoughts\u00a0you want to share about it, please feel free to let me know!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25ef</p>\n<p><em><strong>Jam Submission Information</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Game: </em>Asteroid Archiver</p>\n<p><em>Developer: </em>Ian MacDonald | phantomdonut@yahoo.com</p>\n<p><em>Trailer: </em>https://youtu.be/ea6MDObxtx0</p>\n<p><em>Backtrace Instance:\u00a0\u00a0</em>https://phantomdonut.sp.backtrace.io/p/AsteroidArchiver<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf13ec02acb285c8e0294183d001bae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhantomDonut"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
