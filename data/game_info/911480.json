Now it's just released in the first year of senior high school<br/>\r\nLanguage setting: \"\u8bbe\u7f6e\" -&gt;\"English\"<br/>\r\n---------------------<br/>\r\nIn the 32nd century, the breakthrough of hyperspace technology enabled mankind to get rid of the limit of light speed, leave the solar system and the first 50 interstellar colonies, and move towards the further unknown deep space. Shortly after the hyperspace technology was put into use, the Earth Federal Government invested heavily to set up a fleet of starships equipped with hyperspace engines to explore the galaxies 100 light years away that were hard to reach by previous sub light speed spacecraft. However, due to the course deviation caused by the failure of the central computer, the starship you command did not reach the target galaxy, but headed in an unknown direction. You will play the captain of one of the starships. On the voyage, you may encounter various emergencies, cosmic wonders and cultural relics. In addition, exploration of deep space and colonization require resources, so you need to collect resources on various planets to meet your needs and finally find your way home and explore the forbidden area of the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nResource system: the most critical resources are metal and hydrogen. Metal can build facilities and repair ship bodies. Hydrogen is the main source of energy for starships. Other resources such as methane can also produce energy, but the efficiency is extremely low and can only be used as backup energy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nConstruction system: on a starship, you can use metal to build or upgrade your facilities. Different facilities have different functions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nScience and technology system: in the late stage of extremely abundant resources, you can use a large number of metals to study science and technology to greatly facilitate your navigation<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInspiration: this game was originally designed because there was no money to buy \"Out there Omega\", so I wanted to imitate a similar game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T04:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e160e13b56d2054c4d1f46103b63b30d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lxy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Lxy"], "esrb_rating": null}
