The game was released in arcades in December 1999, and for the Dreamcast video game console in 2000. A port for the Wii was also developed by Gearbox Software and Escalation Studios and released in 2008. In Samba de Amigo, the player uses controllers shaped like maracas with the goal of matching a series of patterns displayed on-screen. The music in Samba de Amigo is made of primarily popular Latin music songs rather than common or traditional samba. The game also features non-Latin pop songs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1423aeb8ed7c191e0c6391e81d27f9e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Sonic Team"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
