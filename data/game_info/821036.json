The game will have you take control of an evil dungeon lord inside a DnD campaign. Your task will be to manage the dungeon resources (traps, enemies, etc) adapting them to the narration of the game master in charge of the game. Do well and rise as the powerful dungeon lord you were meant to be. Do bad and become a failure to be mocked by even the game master himself.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?:</strong></p><p>WASD-Move</p><p>Space-Interact/Use</p>\n<p>As the game master starts talking he will mention several events that you as a dungeon lord must take care of:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Your task will be to bring the monsters the game master mentions to a magic treadmill that spawns them in the dungeon before the time runs out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-The same thing applies to traps, although they are activated by pulling levers.</p>\n<p>-Eventually, the game master may even ask you to laugh malevolently in a nearby microphone, which you must do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-The complexity of what the game master says will get more intricate as time goes on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-If he asks you to give a weapon or armor to a monster you must first get that weapon or armor by melting ingots and pouring them into a cast.
