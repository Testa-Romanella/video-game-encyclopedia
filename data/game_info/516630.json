Use items, find secrets and traverse this game inspired by classic horror and sci-fi novels.</p>\n<p>No moves are a guaranteed success though some have better chances of success than others. I would recommend that Player 1 be very careful with their moves and to avoid being caught in battle, and that Player 2 attempt to do the opposite by pursuing Player 1 at any cost.</p>\n<p>Also I was gonna put a puzzle here for someone to figure out, but instead you can just have the prize. Try typing XYZZY at certain part. If Player 1 is struggling it might just be the boost they'll need.</p>\n<p><em>SFX are all from\u00a0ObsydianX\u00a0and\u00a0their Horror SFX Volume 1\u00a0which is under CC BY 4.0.</em></p>\n<p><em>SCP-x6x (Hopes) by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/6736-scp-x6x-hopes-<br/>License: </em>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a510f5dc84bba2520c19ecb8357fdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacoder23"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
