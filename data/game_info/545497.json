With the up arrows you can scroll over the rows to the right and left, with the down arrows you can switch all the elements in the column. At the bottom there is a number which is the sum of all the elements in the current column; by turning one element of a row, or the whole column, this number obviously changes. The aim of the game is to make this value 555 for all four columns. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T05:05:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99ba5f0d0f008b33d5ee77a353b2ee65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Proj3ctG"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
