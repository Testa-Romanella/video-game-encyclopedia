You will play as an initially ordinary fish, surviving in the nuclear pollution-infested sea. Attacking and devouring other fish, you will continue to accumulate radiation and mutate, growing into an ocean beast, defeating other monsters, and ultimately becoming the only overlord of this ocean. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The player's main goal is to gradually evolve and build their own giant sea monster by accumulating radiation and devouring other creatures. This process is not only challenging, but also very strategic and personalized. Players can choose different evolutionary paths based on their preferences, and each choice will have a unique impact on the sea monster's abilities and appearance. As the game progresses, players will witness the amazing transformation of their character, growing from a small fish to a giant that rules the oceans, a process filled with a sense of accomplishment and fun to explore. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The enemies in the game are not fixed, but will randomly mutate depending on the environment and game progression, which adds to the uncertainty and complexity of the game. Each time the player enters the game, he or she may encounter completely new challenges and enemies, which requires the player to constantly adapt and adjust his or her strategy. The random mutation mechanism of enemies also mimics the unpredictability of nature, making the gameplay experience in Radiant Ocean richer and more realistic. Players must learn to survive and thrive in this ever-changing environment in order to ultimately become the overlord of the sea. </strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The ocean environment has become extremely dangerous and unstable due to nuclear contamination. There are various dangers hidden in the ocean, and players need to stay alert at all times and utilize their intelligence to overcome the difficulties. The crisis-ridden ocean environment is not only the player's enemy, but also an important factor to enhance the game experience and increase the fun of the game. </strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T07:03:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/0659698680527f76d9f3f3b934fddf4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NightWalker"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NightWalker"], "esrb_rating": null}
