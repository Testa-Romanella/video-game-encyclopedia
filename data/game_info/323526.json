Much of their music is free and fantastic, so go check it out and show them some love!</p>\n<p><strong>FREE ASSETS USED: (For the curious)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I made sure that any assets I didn't make (or was not able to make) would be either cc0 or public domain if possible, and freely available to everyone in the Gamejam or out of it.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>www.cc0textures.com\u00a0- Fantastic website, invaluable PBR assets. Highly recommend a look. Cannot overstate how useful this site has been.</li><li>https://blokatt.itch.io/bktglitch\u00a0- Source of the fantastic VHS Glitch shader you see I've put on everything, downloaded and I converted it from a GMS format to a custom shader that Godot supports (took a while but was relatively straightforward as Godot supports a shading language very similar to GLSL). While I was only able to get about 80%/90% of it to work, go check out blokatt's page for the real deal, and while it's free; if you like it throw them a few bucks!</li><li>https://www.dafont.com/potra.font?l[]=10\u00a0- This is where the Public Domain font I used for the title art everywhere came from. Decent site\u00a0 and can filter on licence, very useful.</li><li>And of course\u00a0https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/\u00a0the man, the myth, the musical legend himself.</li></ul>\n<p>Honourable mention to\u00a0https://github.com/jayanam/fast-carve as while I couldn't get it to play nice with my PC and stop crashing, it is a fantastic Blender addon and the ideas and videos behind it greatly informed my Hard-surfaces modelling workflow. Once Blender 2.8 exits Beta status I will be revisiting this addon for sure!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T04:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e4984a19a95e8a64ea08b3381caa380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeRideForCoffee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
