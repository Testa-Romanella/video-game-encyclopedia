Each cell contains a number, 0 to 9; some of them are shown, some other are hidden.<br/><br/>On the right of each row, and at the bottom of each column, the sum is shown of all the elements of that row, or column.<br/><br/>Matching these indications, you have to guess the values assigned to hidden cells.<br/><br/>To unveil a cell, just tap on it: a numerical keyboard will appear, and you can enter the number you guessed. If your guess was correct, the cell will assume a yellow background, and the hidden digit will be shown.<br/><br/>If your guess was wrong, you still have two more attempts (three in total) to strike the right value; otherwise the hidden digit will be shown with a gray background, and your move will be marked as a fault.<br/><br/>When all the cells will be unveiled, an alert message will notify your success, or the total number of faults.<br/><br/>Before starting a new game, you can choose the level: Easy or Difficult: this will affect the starting number of  exposed cells.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81aa2382181aaeb51b862e5ff9e0dd20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Luigi Fonti"], "esrb_rating": null}
