To pass all the levels you will need the ability of the slime, to change its color, and also a good reaction.</p><p><strong>Basic game mechanics</strong><br/></p><p>The game is based on the mechanics of colors. Slime's main ability is to change its color. Slime can only stand on those platforms with which it matches in color, from all the others it will fall. Available in <em>3 colors</em> red, blue, and classic green. The player can switch these colors however they want thanks to the interface at the bottom of the screen. In some places, you will have to think about when to change the color and when it is better to neglect it.</p><p><strong>You Are Your Own Enemy</strong><br/></p><p>This is the second most important mechanic in the game. It can complicate any even the simplest level several times, depending on the number of your game deaths. On the right side of the interface, you can track the number of your in-game deaths. For every <em>5 in-game deaths</em>, the difficulty level will rise. There are only 5 difficulty levels on each of the game levels. As the difficulty level increases, a color barrier will appear on your game level; passing through it, the slime will change its color to a random one. This can greatly complicate the passage of the game.</p><p><strong>Game levels</strong></p><p>Our game currently has <em>3 levels</em>. All of them are made by hand and they are all different from each other. The first level is the easiest and is suitable for a basic introduction to the game. The second level is of medium difficulty because there the distance between the platforms is greater than in the first level. The third level is the most difficult due to the longest distance between the platforms and also the use of experimental mechanics in creating locations. But it is important to remember that the mechanics of You Are Your Own Enemy can complicate any even the simplest level several times.</p><p><strong>The visual and audio components of the game</strong></p><p>We were very inspired by the old games. What is noticeable in the style of the game and music we have chosen. But it is important to note that everything except for the audio was done by us <em>personally!</em><br/></p><p><strong>How to play Color Slime?</strong></p><p>Color Slim supports both the keyboard and gamepad. The gamepad can be from both Xbox and PlayStation, but you can\u2019t use the menu with the gamepad, you need a PC mouse\u00a0for this. Our recommendation is to play on the keyboard, as using the mouse is very simple.</p><p><strong>Information from developers</strong></p><p>This is our first game on itch.io\u00a0and the second game made for Game Jam. Please leave critical comments. It is important for us to know what problems the game has so that we can solve them. We hope you all like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T18:47:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/269aec4af5d8d23107f50aa5d40dd5ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Point", "calculatoriq"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
