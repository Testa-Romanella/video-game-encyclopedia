Forced into a crash landing, he is thrown from the wreckage of his aircraft as time magically slows and he instinctively propels himself to safety. With his newfound dashing ability, he will have to navigate the hidden world and disable the protective Caretakers if he hopes to return to the world below.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>W\u00a0A S D - Run\r\n</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Plan/Dash\r\n</p>\n<p>Left-click - Place Destination\r\n</p>\n<p>Right-click - Remove Destination\r\n</p>\n<p>The player starts with\u00a0<strong>three dash charges</strong>\u00a0which enable them to\u00a0<strong>enter planning mode</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>place or remove destinations</strong>.
