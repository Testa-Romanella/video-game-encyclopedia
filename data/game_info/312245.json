How many can you kill? Find your ship and escape this place, but be careful, danger is always lurking.<br/></p>\n<p>Press <strong>F</strong> to scan the area and phase the monsters in. This will render them <strong>visible, immobile and vulnerable</strong> for a short amount of time. <strong>WASD</strong> to move, <strong>Space</strong> to jump and <strong>LMB </strong>to shoot.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your phase scanner has a <strong>5 second</strong> cooldown, indicated on your weapon. Remember, one hit and you are dead! The screen will <strong>turn red</strong> when you're nearing death.</p>\n\n<p>Made as part of the first semester Rapid Prototyping course.<br/>As a Wizard Jam 8 submission, we inspired from the <strong>'Disable Enemies to Reveal Enemies'</strong> podcast title as our main mechanic.</p>\n<p>The greatest challenge in this project was implementing hit detection &amp; collision towards and from the enemy for both its visibility states.
