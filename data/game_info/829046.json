The gameplay revolves around the roles of <strong>Tank</strong>, <strong>Healer</strong>, and <strong>Damage-Dealer</strong><br/><br/><br/>Raiding.Zone doesn't have \"classes\". Instead, your equipment determines your abilities and your role in the raid. The weapon provides your primary spells and sets your role. Your armor and trinket will grant you a defensive and utility spell each.<br/><br/><br/>While using your weapon, you gain experience. This experience unlocks different talents on each weapon. You can choose one talent at each level.<br/><br/><br/>You can further customize your items by mounting essences. Essences grant raw stats to your item. They will also augments on certain essence combinations.<h3>The Idea of Casual Raiding</h3>I am a huge fan of MMORPGs. I particularly enjoy the raiding experience. I like to play in coordination with other people to defeat a boss. In recent years, I developed an aversion to the current direction of popular MMOs. I don't want to grind for hours to have one hour of raiding time.<br/>That feeling sparked the idea to develop an MMORPG that focuses on raiding. Since October 2021, I worked on Raiding.Zone in my free time.<br/>I am a professional developer since 2016. This is my first experience with game development. I enjoy the learning process.<br/><br/><br/>I will use Steam Early Access to implement changes that need community feedback. For next year, I plan to add new content, community, and competitive features. After that, I have some roughly lined-up ideas. But if they don't resonate with the community, I will change or abandon these ideas.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T03:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cef4aa6e344f7f56e2ff7cd3e031f1.jpg", "website": "https://raiding.zone", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["klg71", "Lukas Meisegeier"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Mayope Software Service UG"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
