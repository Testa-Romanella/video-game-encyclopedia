It was developed by PF Magic and published by Accolade in 1994. The 3DO version was released as a director&#39;s cut in 1995. Ballz offered three difficulty levels over a total of 21 matches. Its distinguishing quality was that each of the characters were composed completely of spheres, granting a pseudo-3D look.<br />\nAlthough the game was not a tremendous success, PF Magic reused its graphics technology in a successful line of virtual pet titles, Petz, Dogz, Catz and Oddballz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-05T15:51:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7ec20800a4f405b7780d4006e1af643.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["SNES", "3DO", "Genesis"], "developers": ["PF Magic"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Accolade"], "esrb_rating": null}
