I personally find the given scripts a little janky, especially the wall climbing mechanic [which i disabled]</p>\n<p><strong>Design Modifications</strong></p>\n<p>- Added 3, distinguished levels. I made them to showcase the different genres that 2D platformer has been taken to. Level 1 is your classic 2D platformer, Level 2 is an obstacle, flappy-bird like game and Level 3 is a simple boss fight.</p>\n<p>- Reskinned the main menu, with a different background, title and button sprites.</p>\n<p><strong>Aesthetic Modifications</strong></p>\n<p>- Fully changed the sprites for the enemies and the player.</p>\n<p>- Score changed into a tooltip for the level, since each level showcases a different mechanic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Changed most of the sound effects in the game, including the in-game music, powerup sounds. I retained some of the sound that seemed fitting for the game. In-game music was edited with FL Studio and Audacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Modifications</strong></p>\n<p>- Added a lot of powerups that changed the gameplay somehow. A speed boost powerup and a jump-boost powerup to make bosses and enemies easier to defeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Added flying enemies with different behaviors. Boss battle was added such that it teleports to a random location after being hit, up until it dies. Upon death, the key to opening the gate that will finish the level will be spawned.</p>\n<p>- Added spikes that damage the player, like a flappy-bird type of game, except that you don't die on the first half and checkpoints do actually exist lol.</p>\n<p>- Retained the heart containers for health but changed the life counter to an icon of the player.</p>\n<p>Pasting the screenshots of the game here as well:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c89/c89feef75ece33baf6c73cb9dc0a3366.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["francisTriesItch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
