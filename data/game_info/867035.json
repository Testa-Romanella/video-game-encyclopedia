After a strange twist of fate, Tsinoka's relics have been scattered across the world. <strong>You must be the team to <em>reconnect</em> the six crystal relics together</strong>- to end the factional feuding and\u00a0be rewarded with great power and prosperity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here in the mountains you can venture about as a member of\u00a0one of the\u00a0five factions. To do so, <em>you must identify yourself with a faction by carrying their emblem with you</em>- but you don't have to side with that faction for the entirety of the match!</p>\n<p>The goal of each match is to <em>be the first faction that collects all five crystal spheres, the white crystal sphere from the castle</em>, and <em>place them in your factions cauldron zone</em>. While there are several duplicates of each colored crystal scattered across the world, there's only one white one. <strong>...and the other catch?</strong> You must navigate these crystals across the world. While searching for and transporting each crystal, other factions can intercept and steal the precious treasure. Your team must strategize how to search for, transport, and defend until you can win the match. <strong>Careful!</strong> Other teams (or maybe you) will start to hoard extra crystals to use as bargaining chips.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0<br/>Game Design, Programming -\u00a0Mitch S.<br/>Technical &amp; Creative Art - Bre S.<br/>Music &amp; Sound - Joe Galloway</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T11:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cdb2138f13b04e81a5f089704062258.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BluViolets"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
