The only sign of sanctuary before you. Do you enter or take your chances in the woods?</p>\n<p>The Willow is a short experimental game made over a month. It was developed with Gamemaker Studio 2. Due to the time constraints the game lacks polish and is a fairly short experience, roughly 10-15 minutes at most. Ultimately this is more of a demo then a full game, but I hope you can find some enjoyment in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls.</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Left click to interact</li><li>Right click to examine</li><li>Esc to quit</li></ul><p>Two version are available, a ZIP version or an .exe installer both are identical, just changes how you want to download it</p><p>Sorry for the issues with the previous ZIP</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df1eaa1a8974fddf02e836372184a753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Draite"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
