A really fun program, and I decided to release it early in order to work on different projects so I can learn even more. I recommend using a speedrun timer if you want to finish this game as fast as possible, it doesn't take too much time to beat, but the game is quite difficult</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T20:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cee/cee85aa04c1e90bf0d9763876cb044d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MassiveBreaker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
