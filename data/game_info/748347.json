{"id": 748347, "slug": "dogfight-aces", "name": "Dogfight Aces", "name_original": "Dogfight Aces", "description": "<p>This is my most successful Flash project released in 2012.\u00a0I sold the primary sponsorship to Tremor Games and non-exclusive to AddictingGames.\u00a0 The game had more than 5 milion plays worldwide +\u00a0 800k plays\u00a0on AddictingGames. Many people liked it so much. Many hated it because it's not for casual players.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>After the Great War, the flying aces who remained argued about who was the best. pilot.\u00a0You're one of them. Upgrade your airplane and make it a nasty killing machine and prove that you're the king of the sky!</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>- Choose mouse or arrow controls in \u201cControls\u201d menu of the game.<br/>- Play tutorial to get into the game.<br/>- Some content remains locked until you finish the Campaign mode.<br/>- If you finish Campaign, play the Campaign once again with red airplane \u201cFokker\u201d to play alternative last level and ending animation.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/>- Rise slowly and attack enemies from the top.<br/>- If you stall often, get some \u201cthrust\u201d and \u201cspeed\u201d upgrades.<br/>- Turn nose down to recover from stall\u00a0or dive with airplane to get more speed.<br/>- \u201cThrust\u201d upgrade affects the ability to speed up faster while diving.<br/>- If you want to reach \u201cSharpshooter\u201d medals, do not buy Tail gun, it screws up your firing accuracy stats.<br/>- Bombs are fine, but Homing missiles are better, best with Guidance system.<br/>- Malicious parachute is excellent weapon against Red Baron (Last level).<br/>- Emergency parachute is worth the money. You have 50% chance to not loose life after you\u2019ve been hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Walkthrough:</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T16:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f5/8f5c5648d6d6929c1a7d12bc03b911ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WideAngleGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
