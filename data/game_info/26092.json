Choose from two modes \n      of play (Regular Game or Daily Game) and begin your journey to becoming \n      a pinball champion. Conquer mythic quests, collect gifts from the 12 \n      Olympians, and push your skills to the limit by facing Medusa, the \n      Sirens, and more. Your portable pinball table will give you a quick \n      adrenaline rush, as you watch the steel ball fly through ramps and carom \n      off bumpers all over the playfield. Rack up combo points, open specific \n      game modes, and even enlist the Oracle for some help. Will you accept \n      Zeus\u2019s challenge?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e83b96e41e73ed6f45ac6fc7dcd987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
