{"id": 287914, "slug": "grandfatherland", "name": "Grandfatherland", "name_original": "Grandfatherland", "description": "<p>The\r\nplayer is the Grandlandfather and must direct the Landfathers and the\r\nfolk of the lands to take over new lands and unite the world into one\r\nbig happy family.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move camera with WASD or move cursor to window border.</p>\n<p>Zoom in and out with scroll wheel.<br/></p>\n<p>Use Right mouse button to command units.<br/></p>\n<p>Use Left mouse button to drag select units.</p>\n<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>\n<p>The large characters in the big white rings are Landfathers. They spawn folk, smaller characters, who look like them. They can have a maximum of six folk spawned at any time.</p>\n<p>The green folk belong to you, the player. The brown folk belong to the enemy who you need to conquer.</p>\n<p>Landfathers and their folk have a head (upper shape) and body (lower shape). A folk will have the same type of head and body as the Landfather that spawned it.</p>\n<p>The three possible shapes are pyramid, cube and sphere. These having these shapes as head or body gives folks different abilities.</p>\n<p>Landfathers always stay still inside their circle, but folks can move freely. Click with the left mouse button and drag the mouse cursor to draw a selection box. Green folks who are within the selection box when you release the left mouse button will be selected.</p>\n<p>Clicking with the right mouse button somewhere on the land in the game world will make the selected folks walk there.</p>\n<p>There are three types of barriers in the game world: mountains, lakes and forests. Folk can only pass through barriers if they have the right body type. Cube bodies can pass through forests. Sphere bodies can travel over lakes. Pyramid bodies can travel through mountain passes.</p>\n<p>When your folks come close to enemy folks, their reaction will depend on their head shapes. If your folk has the same head as the enemy folk, they will happily coexist.</p>\n<p>If your folk has a different head shape from the enemy folk, they will hate each other and begin to fight.</p>\n<p>Every folk has three white markers over their head. These represent health points. When fighting folk deal damage to each other, depleting the opponents health points. When a folk has no health points left it dies.</p>\n<p>A folk always deals a base damage of 1 health point when attacking. If the folk has a head that is strong against the enemy head, it deals a bonus 1 point in damage.</p>\n<p>Pyramid heads are strong against sphere heads. Sphere heads are strong against cube heads. Cube heads are strong against pyramid heads.</p>\n<p>A folks body can also give it a damage bonus of 1 point when attacking if standing on the right terrain type. Pyramid bodies gain a bonus on the red hill terrain. Sphere bodies gain a bonus on the blue swamp terrain. Cube bodies gain a bonus on the yellow orchard terrain.</p>\n<p>A folk can attempt a hostile takeover of an enemy Landfather if the heads of the folk and the Landfather do not match. Move the folk into the Landfather's ring to begin. When a hostile takeover commences a conversion meter is shown over the targeted Landfather. This will track the conversion from the enemy color to the player's color.</p>\n<p>Multiple folk participating in the hostile conversion will make the conversion faster. If some of your folk with the same head as the Landfather are within it's ring, it is not possible to do a hostile takeover. The conversion meter will then be marked with a cross, showing that the Landfather is blocked.</p>\n<p>Folk can do a diplomatic takeover of a Landfather if the head of the folk match the head of the Landfather. Move the folk into the Landfather's ring to begin. The rate of diplomatic takeover depends on how many folk are participating. If a folk's body also matches the Landfather's body, that folk's contribution to the rate of diplomatic takeover is doubled.</p>\n<p>When a diplomatic takeover is underway, a control meter is displayed over the targeted Landfather. This will track the conversion from the enemy color to the player's color. Multiple folk participating in the diplomatic conversion will make the conversion faster. If some of your folk with another head than the Landfather are within it's ring, it is not possible to do a hostile takeover. The conversion meter will then be marked with a cross, showing that the Landfather is blocked.</p>\n<p>You can create a new, smaller Landfather by bringing two of your different looking folk into one of the small white rings. One of the folk will give the new Landfather it's head shape and the other folk will give it's body shape. Which folk gives which shape is random.</p>\n<p>Small Landfathers spawn folks more slowly than large ones. They also have a lower maximum capacity of spawned folks.</p>\n<p>Enemy folk don't just spawn from enemy Landfathers. There are also wandering enemy folk who spawn at the edge of the world. These will spawn more frequently as you take over more Landfathers.</p>\n<p>You achieve victory by taking over all of the big Landfathers on the map! Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p> <strong>Programming</strong><br/>Jesper Tingvall, Adam Green</p>\n<p><strong>Environment</strong><br/>Sara Erenius</p>\n<p><strong>Game design, Writing and Voice acting</strong><br/>Mikael Toftg\u00e5rd</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/>Kevin MacLeod Under Creative Commons Attribution (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)<br/>Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN130003</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:15:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/568/568091c3c55f17cac892b5554f855bf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["J3X"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
