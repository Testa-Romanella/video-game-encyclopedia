{"id": 973819, "slug": "whitetrick", "name": "WhiteTrick", "name_original": "WhiteTrick", "description": "WhiteTrick is played with a fraudster who scams through secondhand transactions and three cops who chase him, with different goals depending on their roles. The imposter \"White\" can move while hiding himself from the three police officers, and must commit additional crimes within a set turn. And, in order to catch such a white, the police can investigate White's path to find his clues, guess the path to arrest him, or block the path to prevent further crimes.<h3>White background </h3>White is raising money by scams through secondhand transactions without a decent job. Already, the face is so well known in this village that I want to leave the village, but I still don't have enough money. Money was needed to leave the village, and only three transactions were left to achieve the target amount. The appointment location and goods for the three cases are already ready. However, due to frequent crimes, a dedicated team was set up to catch secondhand transaction scammers within the police force and heard that they were chasing him. Can he commit 3 more offences without being caught by the police?<h3>Police background </h3>\"James,\" about to retire, transferred to a secluded rural village to spend the rest of his life comfortably, where he had \"Emily\" and \"Samuel,\" the troublemaker known for his good work and strictness. As James predicted, the village was quietly maintaining its daily life without incident or accident. However, similar reports kept coming in from one day. It was a used transaction scam. Most of the descriptions made by the victims were consistent, and a dedicated team was set up immediately to catch him. It was not easy to see him with your eyes, perhaps because he was not a skill that he had done once or twice. It is necessary to track down the place of his crime where the report came in, investigate the surroundings, and find his clues. And guess and predict his route so that he stops further crime!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T06:28:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905e0d1d8ae3db7e523a32f9a56960a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SIA UNIVERSE"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SIA UNIVERSE"], "esrb_rating": null}
