It is presented in Science on Stage Europe 2022.</p>\n<p>Please follow the development of this game closely, as we are putting out updates almost every day for the duration of Science on Stage 2022.</p>\n<p>From the Ground Up\u00a0is a work-in-progress. Meaning there will be more content and patches in the foreseeable future.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: your Windows/Android security firewall might warn that our game might be malware. Our game does not contain any malware.\u00a0We are currently working to certify our game in Google Play. Once it's approved, Android users shouldn't get that popup.\u00a0For Windows users, we are searching for a way to certify our game there too.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Also note: to experience the game fully, we recommend playing it on Windows instead of Android. The Android version isn't very well optimised yet.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For Science on Stage:</p>\n<p>Why we believe that our project is the ideal Science on Stage project:</p>\n<p>- It promotes students' interest in learning in general. The way it does that: it engages students by letting them express themselves creatively. Our game tries to foster the idea that learning doesn't have to be stressful and all about grades. In From the Ground Up,\u00a0 there is no pressure towards the students. They can explore the concept freely and at their own pace.</p>\n<p>- FGU refers to everyday life by making it possible to play it at any time, from any place. You can even carry the game in your pocket!</p>\n<p>- It has a sustainable effect because we believe our game can serve as a starting point for developing other educational games in the future. Our game is one of the few games that talk about pottery. Additionaly, our game can potentially reach a wide audience of people. If we can spread knowledge to thousands of people at a time, we think it's a success.</p>\n<p>- It's feasible in everyday life because our game is free and available on any Android or Windows device. It can also be financed with reasonable expenses since our game is free. We live in a time when\u00a0making games can cost 0$ !</p>\n<p>- Our game promotes inquiry-based learning by letting players explore the game and choose what they want to learn. We have guiding quests to help players when they're lost. But players are free to can experiment with glazes, form new vase shapes, explore abandoned Otrar or build a house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T07:53:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f867d0c77529dd677dd82cfb70ad001.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Temirnator"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
