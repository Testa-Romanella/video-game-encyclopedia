All we can tell you is Bernard's desire to eat brains is only matched by his compulsion to carry on making sure spelling lessons continue. Avoid the sickly sweet children as they will suck the life out of Bernard, avoid the hazards in the form of spinning candy and spikes as they will hurt. Look for the brains with the letters on them...be sure to collect them in the right order so that Bernard can spell the words out properly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c7db8ea490e2a2ff5758f939d7f4cb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AldoZond"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
