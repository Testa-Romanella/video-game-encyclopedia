She is an umbrella from the boring grayscale world who longs to be free. During a strong wind she breaks away from her master and manages to float high into the sky. While exploring she discovers a group of small bright and vibrant floating islands. She meets the people and finds out that they will repay her with colour if she can complete some small tasks. Advance through the game and acquire all the colours as you explore the islands.
