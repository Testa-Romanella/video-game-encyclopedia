Staying in either mode for too long will cause your ship to explode so be sure to keep switching between modes before the weapon or engine stability reach 0. Switching modes will reset stability to 100% and grant you a temporary immunity shield.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Rotate - Left/Right Arrow Keys</li><li>Switch Modes (Accelerate / Shoot) - Spacebar</li><li>Menu Navigation - Up/Down Arrow Keys</li><li>Menu Selection - Enter</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Created for Ludum Dare 49</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/703/703baffae2c39447d5cfcb184656625a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IcedJaM"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
