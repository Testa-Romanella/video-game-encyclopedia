The game tries to adapt to the theme in the sense that depending on your perspective and the way you change it, according to a certain situation, you can move foward to the next level. It is also a project from Phyrie, who did the programming and level design, as well as Rice Grain, responsible for the artwork, including character design and almost all set pieces, and sound (but with no expirience whatsoever so any sound was found on a royalty free website, sowy :3) Also, the game works with the basic wasd controls and mouse clicks that are shown, as well as the ability to move boxes by pushing them with your character.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 To check out more of the creators personal work, their instagrams are @arts_by_willow (for Rice Grain) and @pixelphyrie, it's our first official project and game jam, so we hope yall enjoy and please give us feedback on what can be improved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38b/38bd005406ecb3787624ea6986ff9adf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phyrie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
