You can play it if you want.</p>\n<p>You won't be playing it for hours, but it's a relatively small\u00a0file that starts up quick and if you don't like the hand you're dealt you can just press 'R' to restart.</p><p>The game's suits and colours are randomised each time you start the game.</p>\n<p>In the \"Custom Start\" .bat file you can choose how many suits you want to play with: the default is 3. 2 is usually impossible and anything more than 5 is both too easy and too hard to read (the cards get smaller when there's more of them).</p>\n<p>A secret feature of custom start is that you can type two numbers separated by a space to choose both the number of suits and the number of spaces that the cards deal out into. This can create some interesting/annoying combinations: try it!</p><p>My mum's really good at solitaire and she says she likes it.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c457baa4cc20950e4f79497b2af38c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Stout"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
