Try to bounce your opponent into the right or left walls to gain a point. Who ever gets ten points wins!</p>\n\n<p>I made this with Unity, and did the music in pico-8, not much else to say.\u00a0Enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4e/b4e69c6871930f00b3fdfc2615a68144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["void Games(play);"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
