Good! <br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you control Wideboi and Longboi separately or merged together as the mighty Chad. Separately, they are scared and weak, but using their combined powers they become unstoppable. But they will realize that their separate powers are needed too.</p><p>It works better if you download it (Windows only), so consider playing it that way.<br/></p>\n<p>Can they overcome their obstacles? Who knows? <br/></p>\n<p>This is a small game/demo project that I made for a game jam, feel free to rate it, and I might continue the development toward a fully fletched game.<br/></p>\n<p>Estimated completion time: 5-10 minutes</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback (bugs, suggestions, anything), please do not hesitate to e-mail me at <em>devoursoft@gmail.com</em>.
