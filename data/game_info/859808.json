Every 10 seconds, something will happens. A line or two will spawn, bombs can appear, wind can mess your controls.\r\n</p>\n<p>You have only three live. When you click on a bomb or when a line reaches the top, you lose one. You lose points when you click, you gain points when you click on three aligned and matching items. Bombs can be destroyed by matching them, locks can be destroyed by clicking two times on them.\r\n</p>\n<p>I had not the time to include SFXs or a title screen. Sorry. Only a binary for Linux is included. Windows build and Casio fx-CG 50 builds coming soon\u2122 ! <br/></p><p>Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare #51.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T07:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a88a2f3702675acf1f0667a10061fa32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Mass\u00e9na"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
