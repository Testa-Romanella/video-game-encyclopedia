I came up with the idea halfway into coding it so idk how that works. I interpreted the theme slightly differently.\u00a0 Instead of being set outdoors in the wild and stuff, it is actually set around doors. You have to go through doors, and come *out doors*. What can I say I thought it was pretty smart myself.\u00a0 The coding is done in pure Js making use of the ctx, which lets me draw images on the html5 canvas.\u00a0Anyway there are a few levels, I drew the graphics in a legitimate version of\u00a0Photoshop (it actually was), and recorded the music with audacity through my windows 7 quality laptop microphone (so you might wanna mute it :D) This is my first game jam, so pretty excited ngl.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it (let alone play it lol :)</p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to Move</p>\n<p>Click on the game and\u00a0Press Enter to begin!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3b3cfb4c08cd185e611917259866cd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["loui4"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
