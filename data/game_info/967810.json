While breaking blocks and reaching the portal is your main goal in all of the 100+ levels, doing so may not prove so simple. You will need to utilize blocks that fit the situation, be it changing colors or opening passageways, all while avoiding the dreaded skull blocks.<br/><br/><br/>Most of the time, you will need to change your ball's color in order to break the blocks of the same color.
