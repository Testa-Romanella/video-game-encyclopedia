You are an \"alien\" who has the mission to explore our solar system. With each new explored planet you have to return to your home galaxy the Andromeda Galaxy and answer questions about this explored planet.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to explore all eight planets and answer the questions correctly.</p>\n<p>This is my first game which I published on itch.io. The game is still a work in progress and might contain bugs that are not found yet. I would be very happy about feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/179/179280540dfd07bc84caad69539f75d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M1nsDev"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
