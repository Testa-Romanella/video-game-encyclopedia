The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.\r\n\n\n<em>Controles:</em>\n<em>WASD : Walking</em>\n<em>Right Mouse Click : Lighten up a match</em>\n<em>Left Mouse Click : Pick up Objects</em><p><strong>This prototype was created at the\u00a0GameDesign//UE\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Applied Sciences Europe.
