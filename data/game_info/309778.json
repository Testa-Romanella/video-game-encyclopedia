Flyeeex is a very brave warrior.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/><br/>Once there was a planet inhabited by white people. It gravitated around a gentle black star in a cozy galaxy. People\u2019s mood has always been a color of their skin.     <br/>People lived in peace and friendship together rejoiced to good and helped each other with troubles, as they were honest, kind and sympathetic. Troubles happened to them very seldom, it is possible to tell that almost didn't happen...<br/>Until one day\u2026 a real alien spaceship appeared near their planet.<br/>The spaceship was very old and it was visible at once - all in rust spots, scratched by asteroids and space dust, deep dents in several places, some joints of its covering have dispersed and some pieces of heat insulation and wires sadly hanged down. There were only three working engines out of ten. However despite solid age, and subsequently it has become clear that it was about twenty thousand years, it was still working.<br/>And then when he has flown up to the planet of white people on necessary distance, one of his hatches has revealed, and the metal manipulator covered with various chambers and scanners was extended from there.<br/>Having developed to the planet, it got down to work. It estimated structure of the atmosphere, temperature, existence of life and natural resources. Then the obtained data have been processed by the powerful computer and transmitted through the special device that was a  heart of the spaceship - a hyper-spatial portal, on huge distance to the planet of those who created this ship.<br/>Yes, the ship had no crew; it was just a  robot, and its main task was search of the manned worlds. And when such world was found, the ship opened a spatial tunnel, and owners appeared on its board.<br/><br/>It was very convenient technology, as it wasn't necessary to travel all over the Universe being in annabiosis. Both information, and matter were transferred in hyperspace millions times quicker; therefore a teleport started working in an hour, and two came out of there. Small in stature, about the same as people found on the planet. Their faces were shining with joy and friendliness, they were gloomy and taciturn. Going to a huge screen in the center of the room set out with equipment, they looked at the newly discovered planet.<br/>At last, one of them said \u2018Look what a vile folk, they are smiling as mad persons\u2019. And another answered \u2018What a disgusting white skin they have\u2019. Destiny of the planet was decided in a few minutes - chains of equipment and a column of a landing stretched through a portal to the main hall of the spy-ship.<br/>Newcomers were unsociable and concentrated, the laughter and fun were considered at them as a bad form. Their skin color was black, but not as black colors of plants, but as black as color of melancholy and rage \u2013 they always had such a mood. Those people relied on equipment and computers in everything.<br/>Even though their most important governor was the Computer because they didn't trust each other. Computer was their governor, and it thought up to send spy-ships to all ends of the Universe very long time ago. Its creators, black people, unlike white people who didn't know wars, were at war very often, almost all the time. So proceeded the whole centuries until one their part has won against another. But having even won, they couldn't begin to lead happy life. The fear that someone can attack them any minute made their life miserable. Even though there is no enemy left on their native planet, they started looking for them everywhere where they could. They began to be afraid that once somebody can arrive from depths of space and enslave them.<br/><br/>They didn't believe that kind beings can live in the Universe because they had exterminated such creatures in the society. When they had created to themselves the governor robot, they asked him how to secure themselves against such invasion of enslavers in absolute sense. Their governor was the powerful computer, but he thought rectilinearly as every computer. Having spent no more than several microseconds for a solution, he answered \u2018We have to bear values of our society to all living beings in our Universe\u2019.<br/>\u2018If they become same as we are and join our civilization it won't be necessary to be afraid of attack, they will live under our laws!\u2019<br/>At first black people behaved politely and carefully among white people. They even tried to re-educate white people, and even black strips slightly began to appear through the skin of some white people. When several such people had died of melancholy, the black understood that nothing would have come off. They began remaking the planet; they began chaining in rigid black prickly armor everything they could reach, as they had done on the native planet before. So white people had to recede to lands that the white hadn't managed to remake under themselves yet.<br/>When there was only a small part where they still could live on all planet, all white people gathered and decided to create a defender and a deliverer. White people reached something too, as their civilization was based on biotechnologies - they grew up plants and knew how to grow up what was necessary! Therefore, they collected all the forces and knowledge and have grown up... HIM!<br/><br/>It was a being similar to a peach or white, or even a grapefruit, or a melon.  It was a live organism, strong and courageous, capable to throw down a challenge to cars of the black. Each of the chief scientists, white people, put special abilities in the new hero: he could decrease or become incorporeal for some time and filtered through walls, and also accelerated and flew as a bullet when it was necessary.<br/>Hope sprang up within white people and the way began. It was necessary to pass the lands occupied by the black, to board the ship, to get through a portal into their world and to destroy the car to hyperspace so that the black could never cause harm to anyone anymore.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T22:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17fb2b81aa4e4dd4f9005afc45e6025d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dnovel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dnovel"], "esrb_rating": null}
