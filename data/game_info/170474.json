Every movement and special event, as well as enemy attacks,\u00a0have energy costs. If you run out of energy, you can't move, and you need to restart the game using <strong>F5.</strong></li><li><strong>Energy is scarce</strong>, so be wise and use your best strategy possible.</li><li><strong>To gather energy,</strong> <strong>you need to mine</strong>. Mines are the <strong>orange stones</strong> displayed all across the map.\u00a0</li><li><strong>You can create miners on top of mines with Sekitan</strong>, but he can only create two mines at a time. After the mine is depleted, the miner also gets destroyed.</li><li><strong>Demons are spawned from volcanoes</strong>, whenever you kill one, another one\u00a0is spawned. However,\u00a0<strong>there's a place in the map which can disable them, and </strong><strong>only Shiojiri can find it</strong>.</li><li><strong>Shiojiri can use trees and buildings as platforms</strong>, but he can't walk through magnetic floors.</li><li><strong>Namida, Kumo, and Sekitan can't walk trough water.</strong></li><li><strong>Namida is the only character that can kill enemies</strong>, but you don't always need to move to shoot them, thus preserving energy.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Sekitan spends less energy moving,</strong> so you should consider using him to flip switches.</li><li><strong>Kumo wastes more energy moving.</strong></li><li><strong>Kumo can create walls</strong>, which will be\u00a0usefull to protect mines. She can only create 10 at a time.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Walls can be knocked out by enemies.</strong></li><li><strong>Only Kumo and Shiojiri can walk trough walls</strong>.\u00a0Be careful not to trap your other characters.\u00a0</li><li><strong>You can use Kumo as leverage for Shiojiri.</strong></li><li><strong>Only Shiojiri can press bridge switches.</strong></li><li><strong>Namida, Kumo and Sekitan can press magnetic floor switches.</strong></li></ul>\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n<p>Some important things should've been added but couldn't due to the Compo time constraints. They don't affect gameplay but can be annoying to some extent:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>There's no ending screen. If you're sure you've killed all enemies on the map you win. The map is not that big, but in case you're still not sure, and you've already disabled the volcanoes and still have plenty of energy or mines, then you've won.</li><li>There's no integrated pause and restart options. You have to rely on the browser.</li><li>No additional menus and/or tutorials. This description is the best you can get for now.</li></ul>\r\nFuture releases:\r\n<p>The game is still in development.\u00a0 After reading all your feedback,\u00a0I'm already on the process of improving and correcting the issues you've posted. However, I'm planning for much more.\u00a0The following points are on the stack, and\u00a0the better the\u00a0feedback and compo results, the sooner they'll be available:</p>\n<ul><li>Powerups and unit improvements.</li><li>Gamepad support.</li><li>Original soundtrack.</li><li>A storyline.</li><li>A map editor.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5faead3db0ece935feff3493d1c28c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["p_r"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
