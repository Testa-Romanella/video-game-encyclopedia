The puzzles are generated in a <strong>modular</strong> way, so you may need to open a few boxes to see all possible arrangements.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the <strong>mouse to move</strong> around the box, <strong>click and drag</strong> on objects to move or use t<strong>hem. That\u2019s it! <em>\n</em></strong></p>\r\nHow the game was made\r\n<p>I used Blender for modeling and Unity for the actual game.</p>\n<p>At  first I was dissatisfied with the theme, but then I had the Idea of  making a cube with lots and lots of puzzles on it, which you have to  solve to get <strong>deeper and deeper into the cube</strong>. I didn\u2019t  have enough time to put all the features I had in mind into the game,  but at least I got three types of puzzles working, which is (I hope)  enough to get the idea across.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T16:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd7/dd78553dd6b2a3d5933dd9103c4bdf92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Triastase"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
