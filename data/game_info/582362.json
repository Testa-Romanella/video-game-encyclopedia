I'll be more than happy to get some inspiration from you guys.</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a retro-style shooter where the only goal is to rush forward through no man's land and avoid numerous obstacles. Sadly, I wasn't fully satisfied with the outcome, so I\u00a0kinda left it half-baked, but I wanted to publish it somewhere so that maybe someone can play and give some feedback or even inspiration on how this idea could evolve into something interesting (perhaps even in a different setting than WW1).</p>\n<p>The demo is basically an endless loop of attacking trench after trench. After killing all enemies you proceed to the next procedurally generated level. You have a limited number of friendly bots you can instantly spawn to help you defeat the enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>X - spawning friendly bots (press X then position the placement mark and left click to spawn)</p>\n<p>LMB - shoot</p>\n<p>F - climb the ladder</p>\n\n<p>Music by Rosinsky\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/10000tonsperhour</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T18:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9d/e9d52ea4d246f3054ed2e3ad1b11d626.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gameAmbient"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
