At one point in my life, I had over 1000 PS1 games &amp; still to this day love playing them. I have always wanted to create an accurate rendition of what a PS1 game actually looks like &amp; after spending months fine-tuning my post-processing materials, I finally feel like I have achieved what I set out to do. I love horror games and I wanted to be the one to throw my hat in the ring &amp; have people experience what my version of a PS1 style game could be.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you have enjoyed any of my games then please consider supporting me on Patreon where you get access to free games &amp; other goodies!
