His purpose was to get to inhabit a hermitage, in complete solitude. During the game, the player can help the friar to overcome the temptations by obeying the Carmelite rule or he can succumb to them and undergo the corresponding punishment. If Fray Gregorio manages to advance to the last level, he must play against the Devil, if he defeats him, he will reach the desired hermitage</p>\n<p>This game is planned for three levels, of which two are already finished. The fight against the Devil remains to be developed.
