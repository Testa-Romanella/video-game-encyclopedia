The player controls a bomberman character and can place bombs on the ground to clear obstacles and defeat enemy bombermen. The bombs have a timed fuse and will explode after a few seconds, damaging everything in the blast radius. The player must use their bombs wisely to create pathways, eliminate enemies, and avoid being caught in their own explosions. The game features power-ups that can increase the number of bombs the player can carry, extend the blast radius, or provide temporary invincibility. The game ends when only one player remains or when the player completes all levels. 2D Bomberman is a fun and challenging game that requires quick thinking and good strategy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T09:54:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f03d97d0948449a376764341b3466454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BenLev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
