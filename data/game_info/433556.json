Your heart loses health whenever enemies reach it.</p>\n<p>Try to be smart and modify the path that enemies take to the heart, increasing the amount of time your towers can attack them. Use the best combination of towers and upgrades. Oh, and don\u2019t forget your spells!</p>\n<p>And if you think you\u2019re good enough, try your luck and skill in the <strong>1-life challenge</strong>!</p>\n<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> The game can be fully played with only the mouse/touch, but WASD/arrows can be used to adjust the camera.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc5/fc50c819f2afda718a07749052ea740a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nelson William"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
