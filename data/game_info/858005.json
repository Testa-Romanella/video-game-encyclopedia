Created with Construct3, Space Wars\u00a0is designed only for desktops with a keyboard and cursor only.\u00a0It's highly inspired by Space Invaders and Galactica!<br/></p>\n<p>Additional Notes : Submitted as part of a 6-day school assignment, this is\u00a0my first ever game project...meaning it has LOTS of\u00a0mistakes (sorry). Still, I\u00a0thought I might share here too.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T08:17:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/998effde9179a91f833c39abda2120b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BOEBOE :)"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
