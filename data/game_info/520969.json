Hector went about his life in the village, tending to the sheep and taking care of his aging grandfather. Until the Plague came. His neighbors were the friendly sort, the kind of people willing to lend a hand at any time of day. Until the Plague came. His grandfather, Helmut, was doing quite well for himself, as he was remarkably healthy for his age. Until the Plague came. Hector never really attempted to leave the Valley. Until the Plague came.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Hector\u2019s Quest</em> follows Hector the Shepard as he ventures out from his village to find the last ingredient to create a special balm. This balm is able to heal plague victims, one of whom is Hector\u2019s beloved grandfather. The ingredient is Great Honey, produced by the Great Bee of the Mountainside. Unfortunately, Great Honey is also the preferred food of the various ghouls and monsters roaming the countryside, and they are not too amused by humans trying to snag their precious food. It is up to Hector to enter the mountain lair of the Bee and obtain the honey. To navigate from the Valley to the Mountainside, Hector must circumvent the ogre guarding the Bee\u2019s lair. Once he either slays or avoids the monster and touches the door, Hector can enter the Mountainside. Once inside, Hector must find the chest of honey, the key to the chest, and then escape with the Great Honey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea08ed5173a412ea917dc3ca67bd81b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["amb0103"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
