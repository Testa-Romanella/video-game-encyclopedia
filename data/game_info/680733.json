His boyfriend went missing.      </p>\n<p>And then, so did he.  \r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Not really though. It's just story.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game features furry characters, tantalizing gay romances, and some good clean Halloween fun (and violence).</p>\n\n<p>(This is my first game so any feedback is super appreciated!
