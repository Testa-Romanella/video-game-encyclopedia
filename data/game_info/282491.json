The planet has become a gigantic junkyard. The new ecosystem consists of monstrous mutants that evolved from the remnants of the human species and now spend their lives eating each other.</p>\n<p>The only thing that remains of human civilization is a space station that harbors both a genetic repository of all life on earth as well as a library of all significant cultural achievements, guarded by a highly developed artificial intelligence: the Orbital Ark. Originally this was built as a safeguard against large scale extinction events.<br/></p>\n<p>But neither war nor natural catastrophes occurred, and the Orbital Ark was forced to watch the world decay slowly over the centuries. As long as the planet was populated, a safety mechanism prevented it from taking action. Over time, the space station started to fall into disrepair. In a final act of desperation, the AI decided to send down a robot with only one mission: Exterminate all life so that the world can be recreated anew.</p><p>VERSION 0.02 CONTAINS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMBAT SYSTEM<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/228abaead931690350c446de6c531661.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lance of Longinus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
