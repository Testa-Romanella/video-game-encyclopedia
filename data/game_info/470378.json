It was made on GameMaker Studio 2.</strong></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>In 7 Forbidden Frooooooots and a dog, you will control a dog that travel to the forbidden island in search for the forbidden frooooooot that was said to be able to cure any disease in order to save its owner. Each level will be a platformer game where you need collect enough frooooooots to pass the trial and proceed to the next while trying to not get killed by the beasts lurking on the island.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, this game is a very basic platformer game with janky physics. Its purpose was to get myself some experience assembling simple designs, codes and art assets altogether into a playable demo.<br/></p>\n<p>I spent around 2 months making this from the ground up. It was not amazing but for my first experience making some sort game prototype/demo, I am still super proud and satisfied with it.</p>\n<p>Also the dog has become avatar/mascot ever since.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41aff66266f20ff81ca9a017fc09f54a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Palmmy Palmmy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
