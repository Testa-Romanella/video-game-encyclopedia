FOR MAKING THE AUDIO</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Jazzorcist is the bee's knees when it comes to exorcisms. With the help of his trusty saxophone, he can expel just about any kind of unsavory creature from its unfortunate host.</p>\n<p>But this time, he's bitten off more than he can chew.</p>\n<p>A particularly nasty spirit has taken hold of one of the churchgoers, and won't go down without a fight.

Almost as if something\u00a0 (or someone) is conspiring against him.</p>\n<p>Oh, he's also stuck in a time loop, giving him two options:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01. Find a way to escape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.
