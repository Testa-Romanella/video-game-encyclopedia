Ok, alright, fine.<br/>\r\nIt's about two hour long story, where you're playing as a guy who atends to a psychologist to deal with his problems. But then sudently, out from nowhere, completly unexpected... very interesting things come to happen and adventure begins!<br/>\r\nWhat is it like? I just gonna say, that I'm a fan of DDLC, Nier:A and LiS. I'm not saying it's similiar to them, or as good, but if your had soul crushing experience while playing them too, then maybe you'll find this game of mine interesting. If not, then sorry for wasting about two hour of your time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGameplay mostly include decision making and riddles. It's Visual Novel after all, so what do you expected? Action gameplay? Maybe a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat's all. Thank you and have a good day.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c92/c92e7242fc8440eab66e2e55853c168b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Give Me Money"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Give Me Money"], "esrb_rating": null}
