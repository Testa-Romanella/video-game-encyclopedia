The rules are simple: stretch elastics onto pegs, bounce little Trix creatures on them, and hit the targets. <br/><br/>But easier said than done! Throw in challenge gems to collect, new zany kinds of elastics, moving obstacles, anti-gravity, and a quest to make the Perfect Shot - and suddenly it's an hour later and you've forgotten to make supper. <br/><br/>Oh yes, it's that kind of game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1de/1deb188a4b3e5ce3d5e55f0b5805c0ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 19}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hyper Hippo Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyper Hippo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
