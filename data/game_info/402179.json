Moderation is the key to success!</p>\n<p>My first real game, created from the ground up. Please see the README for some known issues and workarounds--the game will not break, but there is some odd behavior here and there.\u00a0</p><p>Also, please give feedback if you can!\u00a0 I would really love to expand this idea in the future, and any pointers you may have would be much appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f3/5f3b5b609c978c93cfcdb2062adf5ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Knockaboot"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
