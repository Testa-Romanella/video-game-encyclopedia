Also added a particle effect behind the missiles.</p><p>Level 9</p><p>Added effector to prevent passage through the tunnel, and particle effect to show the direction. If you can find the button, both will change direction making easy access to the hole.</p><p>Level 10</p><p>Rope bridges must be navigated through to the hole.</p>References<p>Tutorials, Textures for walls and background, viewed 13 July 2020,<br/><https: 350553=\"\" content=\"\" d2l=\"\" home=\"\" le=\"\" mylo.utas.edu.au=\"\"></https:></p><p>Youtube, <em>Portion of the aiming code</em>, viewed 19 Oct 2020,<br/><https: watch?v=\"c-8vzb2Is3o\" www.youtube.com=\"\"></https:></p><p>Clipart library,\u00a0<em>Ball,\u00a0</em>viewed 21 Oct 2020,<br/><http: clipart=\"\" clipart-library.com=\"\" golf-ball.htm=\"\"></http:></p><p>Flaticon,\u00a0<em>Missile</em><em> without blast</em>, viewed 26 Oct 2020,<br/><https: free-icon=\"\" missile_1537041#=\"\" www.flaticon.com=\"\"></https:></p><p>1001FreeFonts,\u00a0<em>Typo round</em><em> font</em>, viewed 27 Oct 2020,<br/><https: typo-round.font=\"\" www.1001freefonts.com=\"\"></https:></p><p>Freesoundseffects,\u00a0<em>glf+swng and golfballSinking,</em>\u00a0viewed 31 Oct 2020,<br/><https: free-sounds=\"\" golf-10105=\"\" www.freesoundeffects.com=\"\"></https:></p><p>Orangefreesounds,\u00a0<em>Groovy-funky-music-clip, </em>viewed 1 Nov 2020,<br/><http: groovy-funky-music-clip=\"\" www.orangefreesounds.com=\"\"></http:>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:59:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24e7960e96210b86e25261e963330767.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["De-Bawz"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
