The next target of the Swarm's ire on their way to the centre of our galactic hub and the source of that insult is Stercore 48, an artificial \"world\" constructed in deep space used as a refuelling point for cargo craft delivering supplies to the federation's outlying colonies.<br/></p>\n<p>When the attack begins everybody makes for their craft to get the heck out of Dodge, but your intentions are different; your ship the Theresa May might be a bulky, rusted piece of obsolete space junk but she's also armed to the metaphorical teeth. Time to fire up the systems, sling your craft skywards and blast some nasties because... well, reasons. Look, this is a shoot 'em up and nobody reads the instructions for these things unless it's to kill time during loading so I'm surprised you're still paying any attention at this point!</p>\n<p>This game was an entry into the CSS Crap Game Competition 2018\u00a0and the source code can be viewed at Github.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:59:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fb5991845761e57c8a595cc34faad14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C64CD Laboratories"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
