The demo includes a full dungeon and a few explorable locations. Some of the tracks are from bensound.com as well as various DLC for RPG Maker MV.\u00a0 I'm hoping to finish it this year. Hope being the keyword. Getting under 1GB has been taxing and I've selected that any unused assets be excluded, though it seems that causes more problems than it solves.\u00a0If any animations show up as missing (which will result in the game basically becoming unplayable), please inform me so I\u00a0can make the adjustments.
