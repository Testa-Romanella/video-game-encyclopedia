The world around you is black and white which causes your heart to slowly lose health. You need to forage for crystals that grow on plants in order to power an artifact that makes a ring of color. Once powered, the artifact will start moving. The more you power the artifact,\u00a0 the faster it will go and\u00a0larger ring of color it will produce. Be careful not to let your heart or the artifact fall into water. Gameplay is about 5 minutes (if you can beat it on the first try).<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move.</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> to pick up and throw objects.</p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT</strong> to warp to your heart.</p><p><strong>ESC </strong>for pause/options<br/></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Coding and Design:</strong> Me!
