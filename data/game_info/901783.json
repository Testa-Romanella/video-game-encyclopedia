Since it's pretty easy I added a few settings to mix it up.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There's no rules coded into the game, so when stones get captured you have to select the point marker and removed them manually. Points counts as occupied spaces, so you can use it to prevent the bot from placing in areas that are pointless to place in. You can delete stones or place both colors of stones to adjust things on the fly.<br/></p>\r\nSettings\r\n<p><strong>Spawn random stone </strong>- This is used to fill the board at the start of the game. Black, White, 50/50 Black and white. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Automatic spawn </strong>- \u00a0Spawn stones after every move. You can change the number of stones spawned each time, from 1-10. there's also a random range, which spawn randomly between 1 and the current selected number.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Board size </strong>- pick a size between 6 and 19. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Clear board </strong>- press the trashcan to clear the board.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T06:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672ac14752a6875bd79bd568128b7778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["E.T.C.Lundberg"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
