{"id": 673668, "slug": "starbase-simulator", "name": "Starbase Simulator", "name_original": "Starbase Simulator", "description": "<p>With this inital version you can stack Starship on Super Heavy Booster using Mechazilla at SpaceX Starbase Texas, Boca Chica...and launch it! All from a first person perspective.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>\n<p>This is work in progress and in a very rough state currently. I just want to get it out now, so that you can play with it already as there is a lot happening currently in Boca Chica.</p>\n<p>Since focus is on fast iteration, I stick to Windows 10 builds for the moment, which I can test directly (should also run on older Windows versions). Let me know in the comments if you would like to have it on another system. Alternatively, you can also try WebGL\u00a0here, but it is slow and the sky is bugged.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Standard WASD control with Space to jump and LeftShift to run. ESC for menu to change quality and other settings. Reduce quality, if it runs slowly. There is not much optimization currently.</p>\n<p>There are two control boards at the top and bottom of the tower\u00a0 to control the Mechazilla arms. They have sliders to adjust the speed of the arms. Use them!</p>\n<p>The Saturn V ist just for size comparison and not interactable.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I am not fully sure where to go with this project. I am thinking to add some of the following features, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>- VR support (aiming for basic support for the next update)</p>\n<p>- add a boom lift for closer inspection</p>\n<p>- have the Booster/Ship land and catch it for relaunch</p>\n<p>- add horizontal repositioning on catcher arms</p>\n<p>- add fueling</p>\n<p>- add tank farm</p>\n<p>- some kind of welding mechanic</p>\n<p>- maybe even hydraulic/cryo test</p>\n<p>- ...? -&gt; suggestions in comments are welcome</p>\n<p>If you want to fly the thing, there are lots of mods for Kerbal Space Program. But I don't know much about KSP.</p>\n<p><strong>Become a Builder</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you want to support the development, you can become a builder with a donation of 5 Euro/Dollar or more. I want to put some kind of memorial in the game with the names of the builders. For the time being it'll just be a plain board at the spawn point.</p>\n<p>At the moment all the builder money will go into improving the 3D art, which means buying assets or hiring artists. For example, there is a nice boom lift on the Asset Store for 17$. This could be the first investment :D</p>\n<p><strong>Who is the developer and what's the motivation</strong></p>\n<p>I have been working as an electrical engineer at nuclear fusion research facility for 10 years. But I was always also interested in gaming, technology and space stuff. Now I want to recreate what it is like to stack and launch the <em>biggest fucking rocket</em>. It should feel close to reality and include some of the interesting technical aspects.\u00a0\u00a0At the moment I am working almost full time on this while living off of savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Become a Creator</strong></p>\n<p>You can become a creator, when you send me 3D art directly. Ideally a Unity prefab or a fbx model, which I can use without much additional work. I am open to pretty much everything, if it is up to date, especially tower, catcher and quick disconnect arm. A more realistic flame effect would also be nice.</p>\n<p>Creators will get a special mention.</p>\n<p>You find my mail address when you open the game. Please conctact me first before sending me any files.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>\n<p>to Owe and the Senkrechtstarter Community for inspiration and references as well as NASASpaceflight, Lab Padre and the whole Twitter Starship community.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and Asset Sources</strong></p>\n<p>- Latest reference for Catcher and QD designs by\u00a0Owe on youtube</p>\n<p>- Starship and Booster .stl model by AstroNot: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4930612</p>\n<p>- @RGVaerialphotos, launch site photo from July 1st, 2021: https://twitter.com/RGVaerialphotos/status/1411457130213826563/photo/1</p>\n<p>- Tenkoku Dynamic Sky System by Tanuki Digital: https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/1864</p>\n<p>- PortaPotty by DocMyers: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4834503</p>\n<p>- Cybertruck by denniswoo1993: https://www.cgtrader.com/products/cybertruck-ed8afb59-b0db-4ed2-b6ea-f3b24c39a53...</p>\n<p>- Saturn V by MargetaCG:\u00a0https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/aircraft/historic/saturn-v-1479cb7d-b978...<br/></p>\n<p>- Some smaller prop packs and basic starter stuff\u00a0from the Unity Asset Store which you can find easily yourself</p>\n<p>- Launch sound is from some Saturn V youtube video.
