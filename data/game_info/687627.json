{"id": 687627, "slug": "throneborn-demo", "name": "Throneborn: Demo", "name_original": "Throneborn: Demo", "description": "Overview\r\n<p>Throneborn, a brutal 2D hack-and-slash retro-inspired dungeon crawler, offers Souls-inspired combat and classic DOOM-inspired level design.</p>\n<p>In Throneborn you play as Ulf, a once beloved ex-King whose kingdom was stripped away by an evil, unknown force. Dethroned, imprisoned, tortured, and demonized for half a century, Ulf is determined to take back his kingdom, and reclaim the throne he was born to rule.</p>\n<p>Your goal in Throneborn is to clear a series of dungeons grouped together into episodes; each episode has a final dungeon focusing on a boss fight.</p>\n<p>Dungeons pose many threats such as chain swinging skeletons and deadly traps. To help you along the way, look for special powerups and new items; these are often hidden behind secret walls.</p>\n<p>When you defeat an enemy, you'll gain <strong>fame</strong>. As your fame level increases, you'll gradually be rewarded with passive bonuses. These passive bonuses or \"fame bonuses\" will increase your power, resilience, and critical hit chance. <strong>Be warned; if you die, you'll lose all fame and fame bonuses.</strong> However, you can reclaim your fame by returning to your last death location. <em><strong>Please note that you can reclaim your fame only during normal difficulty.</strong></em></p>\r\nDemo Features\r\n<p>The Throneborn Demo includes the first full episode, The Archaic Prison. This episode includes four dungeons, five enemies, one boss, and ten discoverable items. Upon completing normal difficulty, you unlock the ability to change the difficulty of each dungeon.</p>\r\nDungeons\r\n<ul><li>Broken Confinement</li><li>Warren of Disease</li><li>Distended Flames</li><li>The Warden (Boss Dungeon)</li></ul>\r\nEnemies\r\n<ul><li>Rat</li><li>Prisoner</li><li>Chain Skeleton</li><li>Distender<br/>\n</li><li>Armored Skeleton</li></ul>\r\nBoss\r\n<ul><li>The Warden</li></ul>\r\nItems\r\n<ul><li>Worn Leather Armor</li><li>Worn Iron Shield</li><li>Worn Sword</li><li>Worn Greatsword</li><li>Worn Axe</li><li>Worn Great Axe</li><li>Worn Mace</li><li>Worn Great Mace</li><li>Sturdy Leather Armor</li><li>Sturdy Iron Shield</li></ul>\r\nDifficulty Selections\u00a0(Defeat The Warden to Unlock)\r\n<ul><li>Normal</li><li>Hard</li><li>Extreme</li><li>Nightmare</li></ul>\n<p>If you'd like to help support this project, please consider purchasing the official soundtrack.</p>\n\n<p>Follow us, to stay up to date with our progress as we continue working toward a full release!</p>\n<p>https://chainmailstudio.com</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/chainmailstudio</p>\n<p>https://instagram.com/chainmailstudio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:52:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c10f9da6fb137ab5b064567ffe2c31b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chainmail Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
