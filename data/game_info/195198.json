The game takes place in ancient Japan in that dangerous period when zombies roamed the countryside and giant feet owned the skies.</p>\n<p>You, a student of the great martial arts teacher Nashi have been invited back to his dojo for tea, but when you get there the place is swarming with nasties.</p>\n<p>The goal of Teatime Samurai is to use the fireballs from your lantern to kill as many bad guys as possible. Easy enough. The catch is that every time you shoot, your lantern loses a little oil and your field of view gets smaller. Maintaining enough oil to see and attack is a constant balancing act. Save the dojo. Drink the tea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d73/d735dd1c6506a9257a2fea6454689790.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["benergize"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
