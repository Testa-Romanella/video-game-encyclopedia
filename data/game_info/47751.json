Just stuff a sheep or ram with a heap of poisonous filth and feed it to a dragon. Of course it's not the most heroic method but it is very safe and effective. Another option is to announce a reward for the dragon\u2019s head. After that the only thing you have to do is wait while the army of heroes, wizards and freaks drive a monster to its grave. It is always necessary to find a solution to the dragon problem because all the members of this scale-winged tribe have the same disease. It is a strong allergy to humans and their settlements and all dragons use the only medicine against this illness; total annihilation of the humans. <br/><br/>Troubles with dragons are in the forefront of \u201cMajesty: The Northern Expansion\u201d.
