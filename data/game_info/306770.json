{"id": 306770, "slug": "vampires-hate-light", "name": "Vampires Hate Light", "name_original": "Vampires Hate Light", "description": "<p>A game with 3 levels and a level 4 that is endless. In this game you play as a special person that can \"flash\" light with your eyes. Use those flashes to kill all the vampires and ghosts too in the game. Get as high of a score as you can!</p><p>In the every level there are 10 rounds. Kill every vampire in every round to get to the next round. After 10 rounds, you will proceed to the next level. After level 3, this is the endless level. In this level, you will have pickup hearts. Which will regenerate your hp for 20 points. Survive the first 3 levels and get as high of a score you can in the endless level!</p><p>My tip: It's fairly easy to get to the endless level. Just hit 2 birds with 1 stone.\u00a0 It will\u00a0 get hard when you have a score of 200+. ;)<br/><br/></p><p>This is an entry for the NightJam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/933/93336d7125d448af10947b6ba7e5b460.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["empyreum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
