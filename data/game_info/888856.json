Sean's design is also the cover image for this game! You should go check out his work.<br/></p><p>At the moment, the game is basically a faster-paced Asteroids with gravitational mechanics. My highest score is 120!<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>The left and right arrow keys control the ship's direction while the up and down arrow keys accelerate forwards and backwards respectively. The Z key corresponds to the O key on PICO-8, which alternately shoots and then detonates your projectile. The X key corresponds to the X key, which applies more friction to your ship and slows you down.<br/></p>\r\nROADMAP\r\n<p>This game is an early prototype and is still in active development! Here is a list of the planned features and changes.</p>\n<ul><li>Code refactor.</li><li>Gamefeel tweaks including maximum speed on players, bullets, and meteors.</li><li>A better start to the run than just throwing the player in with no time to react.</li><li>Point the ship in a helpful direction at the start of a run, not just always up.</li><li>Smooth ship rotation.</li><li>Main menu.</li><li>Local scoreboard.</li><li>Arrow indicators for off-screen meteors, players, and bullets.</li><li>Basic enemies.</li><li>Two-player mode.</li></ul>\r\nNOTES\r\n<ul><li>This game is in a very early stage! Think of it as a prototype; I plan to continue work and complete my roadmap over the next month.</li><li>The lua code is currently a complete mess. Once I refactor the game (my first priority) I will upload downloadable executables and PICO-8 cartridge.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T14:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a53269d18217d79f5db7454969eb56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oaktal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
