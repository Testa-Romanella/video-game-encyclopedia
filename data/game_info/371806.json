I made this to prove to myself that I could make something feature complete. It has (almost) all the trappings of something I'd feel comfortable expanding into a commercial release. It has:</p>\n<ul><li>Start menu</li><li>Options menu for sound, video, and controls</li><li>Intro sequence</li><li>Multiple rooms with short transitions between them</li><li>Dialogue boxes</li><li>Traditional side-scroller action mechanics (attack, jump, block)</li><li>Different enemies with different ai</li><li>A boss</li><li>Sound effects where relevant</li></ul>\n<p>Like I said before, this isn't a complete game, and should only take about 5 minutes to beat. It's more of a prototype, except I'm not testing out a new concept, I'm testing my ability to finish something. <br/><br/>Feel free to let me know if you find any issues. Thanks for checking out this page, and enjoy the game!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T11:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/602384c1a38f89204bf512d0e43cac98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan Conway"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
