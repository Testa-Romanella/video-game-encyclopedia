You can pick up trees for resources. Rocks for throwing. People for performing tasks (and throwing!). It is a very large island with a lot of places to explore and interact with. You can just build towns for hours or you can mess around and cause chaos. I will try to polish this game as soon as possible. It is very big undertaking and I would like to do this right!<br/><br/><strong>Info and screenshots are subject to change during the alpha.
