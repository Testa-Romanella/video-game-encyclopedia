Weather damage was their main concern.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Forty bucks for maybe an hour's worth of work sounded pretty good. All you had to do was drive over, record some video of the house, check the rooms, and send the video when you got home.</em></p>\n<p><em>A thunderstorm beat you there by only a few minutes' time. You hurried up to the front porch and dug around in one of the flower pots for the spare key you were told should be there; bingo.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>You let yourself in the front door, and immediately something didn't feel right. This house is supposed to have been vacant for months. Why was the TV on? Why were there dishes in the sink? Was someone there?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>You stepped further inside, despite your concerns. You'd be quick, and if anyone was there, you'd just leave. Simple.</em></p>\n<p>_____________________________________________<br/></p>\r\n2000 Navidson Lane is a brief, atmospheric horror game made in 7 days for DreadXP's Found Footage Game Jam 2022.
