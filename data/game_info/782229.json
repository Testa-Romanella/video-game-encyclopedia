Akin to games of the past, players will experience bright pixelated aesthetics and a chiptune soundtrack.<br/></p>\n<p>The world of Ardera has fallen. Wandering through its remains, a woman called Delphine comes across a cold, unsettling dungeon. With no knowledge of her past or why she\u2019s there, she can only move forward, encountering the mysterious Tenants and gods that call these halls home. In order to continue on her journey, however, she must make peace with these creatures by pacifying them\u2026 in dance battles!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Veni, Vidi, Vici</em> requires players to use a controller.
