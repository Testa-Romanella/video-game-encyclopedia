It's a game about a young boy named Jimmy, who wants to save his own lands from starvation. Dr. Vegg has lost in the food contest, and is now trying to get rid of every single possible fruit tree in the fruit plains in order to prevent the citizens of the said place from winning in the contest ever again. Can you prevent Dr. Vegg's evil plans? Find out in Jimmy's Lost Fruits Journey!</p>\r\nDevelopment cycle\r\n<p>This game has been a passion project of mine for a very long time. First started out as a simple Clickteam Fusion game way back in may of 2020. I couldn't keep on working on that version of the game and it was cancelled. Then, a few months after that, I made a remake in the same engine which was also cancelled. It was then decided to move onto a new game engine, which is Game Maker Studio. This is where the current build was made and is still being worked on. I really hope I can\u00a0manage to turn this project into a full thing, but only time can tell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T06:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a85/a85d5cdc9688de46cd59c25f5fa28b12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sxdg"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
