It's meant to be a mix of horror and RTS, with some random generation thrown in. I didn't have time to code a multi selection, so it's kind of tedious to move the soldiers one by one (you can use the arrow keys but that's kinda bad)</em></p>\n<p><em>You can technically make it to the ship, but it might not be fun.</em></p><p>ludum dare page:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/dark-way-home</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/7761399e1d7b42198e45e71194056bd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RicoAlbe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
