Dash teleport, cooldowns, graphical improvements, better use of cover and the tactical value is fully integrated into the gameplay. We've worked hard on this aspect and we believe it's the best teleport system yet in VR.<br/></li><li>Damage system redesign. Improved bullet netcode, bullet speed, removed bullet distance limits, added scattering as a stat for weapon balancing, and flexible function based damage modeling for all weapons.<br/></li><li>Inventory and weapon handling redesign. Massively simplified the inventory system to make gun-play more fun and exciting. Previously this was an overly complicated setup which required multiple menus and clicks to grab, equip, and shoot weapons. Now weapons are generated on the fly when needed. Simply click the trigger to grab, reload and shoot. Reloading is as quick as bringing the controller down to your belt and hitting the trigger to bring up a new gun at any time. Tactical reloads are possible and used guns are discarded automatically.<br/></li><li>Grenade redesign. Grenade throws are entirely predicted clientside now so they behave as what you expect from other single-player VR games. Grab, hold, and throw using natural motion.<br/></li><li>Drone and AI improvements across the board. Optimizations, targeting improvements, new graphical effects, and health bars.<br/></li><li>Added Voice chat. Hold right grab buttons for Global chat and left grab buttons for Team chat. We've remove the text based quick chat and replaced it with a VOIP system. As always, we route the voice data through our dedicated servers so you never leak your IP address to other players.<br/></li><li>Brand new menu system. Our options menu is now available at all times as a controller connected menu. It is also context aware depending on which server and gamemode type mode you're connected to. <br/></li><li>New Weapons: Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, and Rocket Launcher.<br/></li><li>Public internet space station Lobby servers with onboard firing range, arena server lists, and hangar bay.<br/></li><li>Leaderboards and Ranked Mode games.<br/></li><li>Too many bug fixes to count. Massive improvements to server optimizations.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87d16253d9a5e592bfda596c93e48eea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandglass Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sandglass Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
