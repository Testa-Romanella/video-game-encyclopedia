The theme is \"Rule of 3\" and all contestants have 1 week to finish their game.\u00a0The player's job is to escape.</p>\n<p><em>We're underground. How long have we been here...? We were told that if any of us lost the game on the computer 3 times, we would all lose our chance to escape forever... No one has touched it since we got here, but today is the day. We are going crazy down here and at this point we decided\u00a0it's all or nothing. We have to try to escape, <strong>today</strong>.</em></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse + Keyboard only.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and E to interact with objects.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming/Art/Music/Sound - Hayden Roses\u00a0(@rozeface)</p>\n<p>Character sprites and animations obtained from\u00a0http://gaurav.munjal.us/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/</p>\n<p>Free sound samples obtained from https://freesound.org/\u00a0&amp;\u00a0https://www.bfxr.net/</p>\r\nTools/Programs\r\n<ul><li>Unity - Game Engine</li><li>Bosca Ceoil - Music</li><li>Piskel App - Art</li></ul>\r\nIf you get stuck and would simply like to see the game's progression, press \"L\" while playing the minigame on the computer.
