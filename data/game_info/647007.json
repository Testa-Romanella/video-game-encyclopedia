Left behind is a note from the Rat King himself taunting him. Now filled with rage, he takes up his trusty blade and sets out for the king's castle, ready to fight to the death to get his cheese back.\r\n</p>\n<p>The plan? Sneak in through the sewers, and breach the castle undetected.\r\n</p>\n<p>...or go in, killing everything in sight. It'll probably be more like that. In the end, the cheese justifies the methods.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game uses the unmodified \"Irishalini\" and \"Irishalini Bold\" typefaces by Adigun Azikiwe Polack which is protected under Creative Commons.
