As they draw near, it fades into the fog like a mirage, leaving only questions for all who have borne witness to this \u201cCastle Strangerock.\u201d<br/><br/>An up-and-coming scholar named Charlotte L. Wells has had her interest piqued by this local legend and desperately wishes to study it in person\u2014but of course, Harlech Island is no place for an unescorted young lady. To aid her in her investigation, therefore, she enlists the help of an old childhood friend and fallen knight who agrees to accompany her on this adventure.<br/><br/>Arriving in Harlech and catching sight of Castle Strangerock almost immediately, Char dives into researching the mystery head-on, leaving her companion to explore the surrounding environs on his own in search of any artifacts that might help trace the origins of this ephemeral stronghold.<br/><br/>Sadly, this almost immediately leads to his death at the hands of a mysterious swordsman seemingly displaced in time...but death is to be only the beginning of his adventure. <br/><br/><strong>Xanadu Next</strong> is an exploration-centric action RPG from Nihon Falcom, the acclaimed creators of the Ys and The Legend of Heroes RPG franchises. A late entry in their immensely popular Dragon Slayer series and a spiritual follow-up to the late \u201880s cult classic Faxanadu, <strong>Xanadu Next</strong> puts players in the shoes of a gravely injured knight given a new lease on life through ancient magic who must now seek a legendary sword called \u201cDragon Slayer\u201d to ensure his survival.<br/><br/>Players will fight hordes of monsters in real time while exploring the lush, mysterious and perilous environments of Harlech Island, along with the ruins of an ancient paradise known as Xanadu that was partially inspired by tales of the Mongolian emperor Kublai Khan. Along the way, players will uncover bits and pieces of Xanadu\u2019s past in the form of ancient stone tablets and memorandums, piecing together a complex tale of magic, war, an ancient dragon, and a mysterious figure known only as the \u201cBlack Bride.\u201dFeatures<br/><strong>An Interconnected World Full of Secrets</strong><br/><ul><li>Icy peaks connect with fiery caverns, old waterways, mystical forests and magical ruins, creating one single giant map to explore with countless secret passageways, alternate routes, shortcuts, hidden items, deadly bosses and new techniques to uncover.</li></ul><br/><strong>Real-Time Combat with Dozens of Unique Abilities</strong><br/><ul><li>Fight ruthless enemies in real time, using a wide variety of skills to aid you.
