If you see it, I recommend\u00a0lowering your brightness to enjoy the game as it should be.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made in 3 days for the\u00a0<strong>Mini Jam 103: Darkness</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Mini jam is a 72-hour-long, game development jam\u00a0for independent game developers that occurs every two weeks. The limitation in this opportunity\u00a0was \"You are your own enemy\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The idea of the game is to connect all the light beacons to the middle of the world. It is completely dark, but you have a limited amount of\u00a0light within you. You can release that light\u00a0to see the path ahead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, doing this will kill you (This is my interpretation of the limitation, which is \"You are your own enemy\". You have to harm and kill yourself in order to succeed).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is kind of a roguelike in this sense. You will die a lot, but you will keep the knowledge of how the map is connected in your head for the future runs. Try to use this for your advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Move using the\u00a0<strong>ARROW KEYS\u00a0</strong> (or WSAD).\u00a0 Use Z to interact with the world and turn the lights on.</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>Gathering Darkness Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</p><p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T12:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c2e5c2770812f4451eba046e061eabc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tonz Guy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
