Use an arsenal of plastic limbs, wonky tools, rainbow stickers and googly eyes to assemble creations, please demanding clients, and laugh in the face of perfectionism.<h3>Make a thing!</h3>Glue mannequin limbs to robo-parts. Draw on a smiley face. Slap on a few stick-on tattoos to finish it off. Oh, did we mention there's <strong>NO </strong>Undo button? Time to roll with the punches!<h3>Make a living!</h3>Fulfill wacky client requests however you can. From six-armed action figures, to fancy meals served from a toilet seat - any request is (unfortunately) possible. Explore their world and defeat your ultimate enemies: perfectionism and good taste.<h3>Fend off haters!</h3>Flying tomatoes, rabid hammers, electrifying eels... Fend off foes in time or ignore them and see what \"statement\" they leave on your precious thing.<h3>Upgrade your toolbox!</h3>Collect cash for your creations and re-invest it in supplies, tools and workshop upgrades. Expand your inventory or risk ending up making yet another armless Venus de Thingy.<h3>Couch Collab!</h3>Test the limits of your relationships by playing any challenge in 2-player couch co-op mode. Lower your expectations now: you two will be making some butt-ugly things.<h3>Share your creations! </h3>Use the built-in video recorder to share your creations with friends, foes, and the world wide web.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T04:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/279f9f1675dd0d8a5218b70ec5894c0c.jpg", "website": "https://minimakergame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casa Rara"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Casa Rara"], "esrb_rating": null}
