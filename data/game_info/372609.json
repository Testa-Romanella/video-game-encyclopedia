To do so you will explore an island with many unique environments, meet new spirit companions, inject those spirits into eggs to fight alongside you, gather resources for building and crafting - all while facing an assortment of beneficial or dangerous (both random and planned) challenges.<br/><br/>The game: <br/>features a story mode and a free play mode - and a quit button.<br/><br/>is directed towards 90's gamers - because I'm selfish<br/><br/>contains a mix of light-hearted/funny and dark themes - night time is a dark theme, right?<br/><br/>features many puzzles and mini-games. - most puzzles are in the retirement home biome<br/><br/>is stuffed full of random events, rewards, character mysteries and easter eggs.&lt;-- If I could give you chocolate I would.<br/><br/>features a creature growing system where you raise monsters from eggs and evolve them. - wow how innovative!<br/><br/>features a multi evolution path where your fighting style can determine the direction your creature evolves. - I have no jokes for this one.<br/><br/>features a farming system for growing food for survival, battle buffs or quests - Almost definitely not steroids.<br/><br/>features a fully-animated classic side view turn-based battle system. - This is a favorite amongst call of duty fans.<br/><br/>features a mix of original soundtrack and music from other talented artists. - the soundtrack needed to have talent, that's where the \"other artists\" came in.<br/><br/>I am open to suggestions to include things players want as the game is still in development!<br/><br/><strong>The Idea</strong><br/><br/>The idea is to take many of the different genres I enjoyed as a kid and make a tasty PC game sandwich out of them, which I think is most kids dream at one point or another, except for kyle...he wanted to be a fire truck...we don't talk to kyle.  I want to try and get things right that I think those genres sometimes got wrong.  Of course, I will get many things wrong too, but I want to shape and evolve this game for a long time to come. Here on Toby's Island we listen and respond to feedback...mostly because it's an island and we have nothing better to do.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Filling the Gap</strong><br/><br/>I want my games to be more than just fun. let's wring the tears out of you like a tea towel of sadness.  We aren't here to kill time, we are here to kill feelings!  I will have Freeplay mode for people who are already dead inside, but for those of you who want a journey, who are curious, who say aww at kittens and run from good magic tricks, I have a story to tell, just click \"new game\" and hold your emotions close.<br/><br/>If you are interested, the game is currently raising funds on Kickstarter to support full-time development during early access:<br/>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tobysisland/tobys-island-0", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T02:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3bf003964493c297cffeef455408a00.jpg", "website": "https://www.mvisioning.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mvisioning"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mvisioning"], "esrb_rating": null}
