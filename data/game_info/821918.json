But you also have a 50% chance of losing the tokens you inserted. Inserting more tokens may give you a better reward, but it also increases your risk of losing it all. Cash out when you feel like you have won enough to continue playing other games in the arcade!</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by my favorite arcade game Apples and Bananas from Tom's World back in the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>Made by GJ The Game Dev.
