I created it over 11 days for the GDN Book Jam.</p>\n<p>Some of the fun things about the project:</p>\n<ul><li>Lighting system - if the game is laggy, blame this. The flickering candle lighting is a Texture2D which gets its data set pixel-by-pixel every render frame. At least the effect is nice</li><li>Tight and simple physics for player movement and strawberry collisions</li><li>Learning about b\u00e9zier curves and using them for owl swooping behaviour</li><li>The glyphs floating around the shrine was satisfying to get working</li><li>Creating the 32 glyphs and creating a font rendering system to create sentences</li><li>Bookshelf random generation - just supply no. books, how many are readable, and no. candles. Then store a seed when a level looks good</li><li>Making the levels was one of the last things to happen, and it ended up being a very painless and enjoyable experience because of a bunch of code design decisions made along the way. So that was neat</li></ul>\n<p>Things to do when there's more time:</p>\n<ul><li>Procedurally-generated levels (score would then make sense)<ul><li>Seeded, so other players can try the same layouts</li></ul></li><li>Proper end of game - probably just a splash and you get an award on the screen</li><li>Make the books look a bit nicer</li><li>Maybe swooping shouldn't use a b\u00e9zier, and should instead just be a rapid fall + fly back up</li><li>When choosing a random shelf to fly to, avoid flying through player if they're close? Or maybe just warn when owl is about to \"normal fly\"</li><li>Work out why MonoGame icon still appears instead of custom one</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6dadb43fffc4c7e0857d4b7119373cdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Splerp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
