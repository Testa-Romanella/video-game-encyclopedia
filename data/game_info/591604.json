Interactable objects are shown by\u00a0 the animated mouse pointer.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>In this (very) short game enjoy an art gallery while finding yourself getting into deeper and deeper into trouble. Resolve, the problems you create and leave.</p>\r\nAuthor notes (you don't need to read this if you don't want)\r\n<p>Inspired by point and click adventure games like the monkey island series, Mystery of the druids &amp; Night of the tentacle.</p>\n<p>I really wanted to add more to this but like all game jams i ran out of time (or more appropriately energy). From the start i wanted to do something that wasn't a 2D platformer/top down and decided to try my hand at point and click. Overall i think i did a good job building up the backend code to move the character, interact with objects, etc but of course all of that is stuff you as a player don't see! It's a shame it's short but i'm happy with the outcome!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed the game!<br/></p>\r\nTools used\r\n<ul><li>Created in Unity.</li><li>Sound effects recorded using my phone and tidied up in Audacity.</li><li>Music created with a violin and Audacity.</li><li>'Art' created in Aseprite.</li><li>Cat painting created by taking a picture of my cat with my phone and adjusting in Aseprite.</li><li>I did stream some of the development on twitch.</li><li>Source code available on GitHub.</li></ul>\r\nScreenshots\r\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:59:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/502ab34336af0be6a587a386f71e9fbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jademonkey7988"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
