After many years of studying, I finally decided to make a full-fledged mobile game, which is actually playable and not just a prototype. The game has a straightforward concept, you move the paddle under the ball, so it doesn't fall. The more hits you get, the higher is\u00a0your score. But it's not easy! There are multiple tasks you can do at the same time (which is why it's called mania), which give you more score, if you do them successfully, of course, but they easily can make you lose focus and get a game over. Another thing you can do is customizing your paddle and ball, to make the playing more fun.\u00a0Well, this is it for now. Hope you enjoy playing the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0eab506c6ec3f25ae577d3712efc53a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Vahe2003"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
