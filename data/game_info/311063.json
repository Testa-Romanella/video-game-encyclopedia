Clear 150 levels piece by piece in a relaxing puzzle game. <br/>I've created Unpuzzle as a calming experience for all players to enjoy. Good difficulty and learning curves guarantee a way to teach you to play without annoying tutorials. There are no time limits, no punishments for mistakes, no wrong solutions, and there always is a way to proceed. And yet, 10 additional mechanics provide enough challenge even for puzzle fans as they are combined. So if you feel stuck - use a hint, skip the level, or just close the game, take a break, and continue from where you left off once you are ready.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-03T19:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/550/55039aba292ad899e7974d7a7ff71137.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Pavlo Sich"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Pavlo Sich"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
