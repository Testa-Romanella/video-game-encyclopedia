This game is horribly unfinished and I don't actually know if its completable but it's kinda fun to walk around and talk to the NPC's. The game doesn't loop properly (It's supposed to reset every 5 -7 mins) so just press esc and the game ends. restart and BAM, loop. Spam E on doors\u00a0 or NPC's\u00a0and it'll probably do something. I mismanaged my time horribly but I learned stuff and had fun that's all that matters in the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfb7965a96e1989533e01bc6d599c7cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fartychicken"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
