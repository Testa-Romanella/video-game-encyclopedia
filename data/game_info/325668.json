They have hired you to help them gate-keep who gets to be a video game protagonist. Apparently, they decided people should\u00a0need to fill out forms saying their name, their desired occupation in their game, and why that occupation's a good fit. Who cares that some may want to add a bit of spice into their life by trying something new? Who cares that paperwork is really easy to mess up in minor ways? Who cares that even when the paperwork\u00a0<em>is</em> right, sometimes the person in charge of writing up the license requests just decides they're not in the mood to do their job correctly?\u00a0And who cares about diversity, am I right?</p>\n<p>...ANYWAYS, today you've been given FIFTY people to sort through, for an absolute pittance of pay, considering the stress it induces and the whole \"minimum wage\" thing. Yaaaaay.</p>\n<p>But you see, ProtagoNest's BOUNTIFUL awfulness doesn't even stop there. Oh, no, that'd be too easy. Not only are you getting awful pay to be an awful person, but your equipment is ALSO a heaving pile of... awfulness. The last, now-ex employee to sit at your desk got <em>so</em> overly enthusiastic when denying people that they broke the denial button. Why are they an ex-employee? Because ProtagoNest were SO happy with their work that they got PROMOTED! They went from employ-<strong>ee</strong> to employ-<strong>er</strong>!\u00a0And\u00a0did that button get replaced? <strong>NOPE!</strong> It's just been hot-wired to the approval button! Which means that you have ONE button trying to do TWO POLAR-OPPOSITE JOBS!\u00a0So you need to keep an eye on what state that button is in when you're making your judgements, 'cause do the wrong thing even ONCE and you are very thoroughly fired. The only thing you've got going for you on that front is that it changes states kind of rhythmically.</p>\n<p>But wait, wait, wait! There's <strong>MORE</strong>! Not ONLY are you getting awful pay and awful equipment to do an awful job, but your boss has ALSO enforced a TEN SECOND TIME LIMIT to sort each individual person! WOW! What an AWFUL BOSS! This honestly can't be legal, making you work under such awful conditions. You should file a formal complaint,\u00a0or start some strike action,\u00a0or dismantle capitalism, or assassinate your boss, or unionise, or something. Y'know, just spit-balling ideas here...</p>\n<p>Is it obvious I really hate your employer yet? Because\u00a0I do. With all of my soul, I hate ProtagoNest and everything they stand for. But...\u00a0I know, I know, you have to do your job right and get paid to be able to put food on the table, and that means putting up with the awful working conditions, and\u00a0denying people that may not really\u00a0deserve it.\u00a0Just... no matter what happens, please don't forget that the people you're sorting are... well, people. Please. This world needs more genuine care in it, and clear as day we can see that the \"care\" isn't going to come from your seriously awful employer.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61a31ede9e807aeafc936b316d8f06a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordan Han"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
