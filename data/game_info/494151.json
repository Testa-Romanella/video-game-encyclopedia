Tesha is in need of some money and in order to get enough, she has to complete different levels with different obstacles that provide a huge challenge. The Game will feature 22 levels with 2 modes, Normal &amp; Permadeath. The game will receive new updates in the future with new maps and new mechanics and they will all be free!<h3>Normal Mode:</h3><br/>The normal mode for this game is very simple. This mode offers the ability to go through levels without the fear of restarting by using a checkpoint system. Every time you fail during a level you will be respawned at the last checkpoint that you passed through.<h3>Permadeath Mode:</h3><br/>Permadeath mode will feature the same levels as Normal Mode. However, the big difference is Permadeath mode has no checkpoint system, and no matter what level you are on, if you die, you will restart the game from Level 1. This mode is recommended after playing through normal mode first so that you are familiar with the mechanics and controls.<h3>Future Content:</h3><br/>Rent's Due: The Game will be getting updated in the future with new levels, new mechanics and new modes.. All of these updates will be free of charge and will be available within the year.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T14:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b967165bb37b9477ac542b93459cbdfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LewisGillies", "Scotty Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Scotty Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
