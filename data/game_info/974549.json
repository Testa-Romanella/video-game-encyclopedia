Select using the cross cursor and direct your drone with pinpoint accuracy. But beware, each move is a test of skill and judgment \u2013 one wrong shot and you risk a catastrophic underwater explosion.<h3>SCORE AND CHALLENGE</h3><br/>Score points by successfully removing mines, with each mine's score value calculated using a dynamic formula. The stakes rise with each level, demanding greater precision and strategic foresight.<h3>URGENCY AND TENSION</h3><br/>Keep an eye on the shot counter! If it reaches zero, you'll face the consequences of an unremoved mine: an underwater detonation and you lose a life. A warning bleep adds to the tension, signaling your last chance to act. As you advance, the game intensifies, offering fewer shots and increasing the challenge.<h3>RISK AND PENALTY</h3><br/>Mistakes carry a heavy price. Failing to strike a mine or accidentally removing your aiming drone results in the loss of one of your four lives. Each firing decision will be the difference between victory and defeat.<h3>GET STARTED</h3><br/>Ready to embark on this underwater mission and become the ultimate mine hunter ?
