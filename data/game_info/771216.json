Is the process of building and upgrading a tower intuitive?\u00a0 Do you have a good sense of the range of a tower?</p>\n<p>2.) Besides a bit more information regarding the specifics of towers and upgrades, is there anything you feel would improve the user interface?</p>\n<p>3.) How do you feel about the difficulty of the game?\u00a0 We aimed for the prototype to have a rather high difficulty, as we wanted players to hit an end point (losing).\u00a0 Compared to this, what sort of difficulty would you like to see in future versions (Easier, much easier, about the same, harder because I'm a masochist, etc.)?</p>\n<p>4.) It's hard to tell (especially with some graphical glitches we're still running into), but each tower does subtly show its health.\u00a0 Did you notice this fact, and if you did was the display useful?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, if you encountered anything you think might be a bug during your time playing, we'd appreciate it if you let us know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T18:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/77130c85b921c5daef5e2b5c655e634f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hhaak"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
