When you encounter a monster roll the dice to use a skill. Your skills learn from their failures so roll that hard six! Be weary of the fruit as some will help and some will hurt you, but you can always trust the cheese.</p>\n<p>The game is a bit minimal at the moment, but playing around with the combat.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Take your time early in the game. Your skills are at their weakest, and the lower levels are less populated so you'll be better able to collect health and level up your skills</li><li>Some enemies are stronger than others so you may want to choose which skill to level based on the enemy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Shout-outs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dice, audio, and most of the UI assets thanks to  https://www.kenney.nl</li><li>Tileset: https://code.google.com/archive/p/crawl-tiles/</li><li>Font: https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/autopia</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1feca014346f06271d9be121c29168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["yammosk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
