{"id": 682864, "slug": "mass-must", "name": "mass must", "name_original": "mass must", "description": "<p>Originally released for PC, it was a very popular release under the same name and was also a commercial success. It was the basis of a series of gaming magazines, a number of books and games, and was even used as inspiration for a movie.<br/>\nIt's a simple game, but takes some time to play, and requires a lot of focus to make it interesting. Although fun, it is not the kind of game you can play 24/7.\n\nThe game is played using the mouse and a controller, which you load from a directory on your computer. The game uses a magic wand to produce paint, so you can use a paint brush to control the direction and size of the water droplets. You can also paint a bit of water over a area to see what colour it gets. You can use the paint wheels to draw circles, lines, and other shapes.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes to play, and you can buy the item Verstappen.\n\nShow Full Text</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:13:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/389/389a5aa0640b46a45780075fddfa4999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
