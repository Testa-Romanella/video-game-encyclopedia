Hurl your soul from one totem to another in search of answers. Manipulate the environment to progress, but beware of disrupting the balance of light and darkness...<br/><br/>Annwn is an abstract stealth strategy game about making decisions under pressure, played across a series of bleak and lonely procedural islands.<br/><br/>You are a disembodied soul, able to dissolve and recreate elements of this mist-shrouded archipelago. Absorb the energy of trees and rocks, and use it to create totems which you can possess...anywhere that you can see the floor. Pump more energy into a totem to raise it higher before transferring your soul to it. Ascend the hills but watch out for the slowly revolving Watcher, who will try to redistribute your precious energy across the landscape. Find clues to the fate of your lost love hidden around the landscape before ascending to absorb the Watcher itself and move on.<br/><br/><ul><li>Infinite variety of procedural islands.<br/></li><li>Improve your abilities by absorbing Watchers.<br/></li><li>Campaign arcs deliver stories of love, loss, life and death.<br/></li><li>Other, undocumented mysteries await in the Otherworld...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/01607392f56454e0af5f3b461c5a0d9d.jpg", "website": "http://annwngame.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quantum Soup Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Quantum Soup Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
