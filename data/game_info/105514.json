Probably not, so why not come play this now!!!!! TAANG is a somewhat....unusual game...in that, it doesn't have one specific type of gameplay, it is a platformer, FPS,\u00a0racing game and multiplayer game you can play with others, all in one. Why go anywhere else?</p>\n\n\n<p>As this game is currently a WIP, it is not (at this time) paid. However, in the future it will be, so anyone that downloads the game (for free) now, will get the full game for free.</p>\n\n\n<p>All money earned from this game will go towards an expedition in 2019, in which I will be traversing Ecuador, and helping to build wells and schools and anything else the local communities need, in that area of the world. Many of the people there are far less fortunate than anyone that goes on this site\u00a0(financially) and therefore, it would be great if you could buy this game when it comes out properly.</p>\n\n<p>Please, please leave a review, telling me how I can improve, once I get it, I will begin working on the problem\u00a0immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also find TAANG at any of the following locations:</p>\n<p>Get it on Gamejolt,<br/></p>\n<p>Play online at Kongregate \u00a0- certain browsers only</p>\n<p>Or look at our page on Humble.com,<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586301311c54503284cd8c494124943d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Electofunk"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
