Indeed, these questions are oft asked in everyday life, but for you the situation <em>is</em> quite unusual.\u00a0<em>You</em> find yourself a solitary sphere, with no company but some bizarre floating discs. How did you arrive here? There are no memories left, perhaps you were always here, all you know is you must go, where, who knows, but go you must. This\u00a0<em>realm</em> you find yourself in is unusual, even for someone who knows of no other realms, what with the whole memories thing. It appears bizarrely\u00a0chromatic and even unfriendly, as much as an inanimate world can be. If you're still reading, use the pass-code\u00a0darz in the octagonal\u00a0room. It would seem this devilish dimension is composed of multiple colored areas, with a variety of accompanying themes sure to drive you inane. Best get rolling then, and good luck, you might need it.</p>\n<p>Bingo score: 17/25 I tried, but my game engine doesn't allow external assets :P</p><p>Also, I totally forgot about the game theme &gt;_&lt;</p>\n<p>Roll Away is released under the\u00a0GPLv3 license.
