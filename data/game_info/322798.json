As you play through the game, the levels get darker to reflect the stress and anxiety many students feel towards the later years, obstacles will also begin to appear in the form of school themed dangers like a pencil or books etc..., as well as this the levels will become more twisted and loose their colour for a more dark, bleak and twisted theme.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7ec69238fa7ba1768a929d11511bc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phoenix Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
