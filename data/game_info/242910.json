It seems that fate has a different thought from him. Would his plan work this time?</p>\n<p>Mr. Unfortunate is a small 2D puzzle\u00a0 game, with a theme of <strong>time traveling</strong>. In this game, you'll explore diverse scenes and interact with various objects using only the mouse. Whenever you get stuck in gameplay walkthrough, check the journal and follow the instructions.</p>\n<p>This game was created originally for Geta Game Jam #4. That was the first time for me to attend a jam. I underestimated the difficulty of developing a game solely and I didn't complete it at the deadline. But every start deserves a good ending, so I continued and finished the game development the day after. Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>BTW, I uploaded all source codes of this game on Github.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf57d88f1508f4317f8df47bd9c9dfb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jingyi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
