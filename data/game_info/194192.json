Press space to start playing, and escape to get the cursor back.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-WASD: Move</p>\n<p>-Left click: Shoot</p>\n<p>-Shift: Run</p>\n<p>-Space: Jump</p>\n\n<p>Pretty standard for an FPS.</p>\n<p>Match every possible couple in the room to get access to the next one. If you take too much time to complete a room, couples will start to break up (they fall out of love just as in real life)! You can shoot them to \"replenish\" their love, just as in real life. People with grey shirts are aromantic, that's why they cannot be shot!
