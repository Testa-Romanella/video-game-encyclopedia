The scenery is beautiful, but today you must focus on survival, you need new shells. They can be scarce so it's best to stockpile them while you can. Use the hand controllers to earn points by scavenging shells with your claws, and bringing them back to your island. The bigger and more colorful, the better. Time is running out as the tide rolls in, so be sure to listen for the waves, or you will be swept out to sea!\r\n</p><p>How to play:<br/></p><p>*Bring the best shells back to the island.*</p><p>As the waves roll in, the sea level around the crab's island will rise. Each wave clears the previous shells, and deposits a new shells. After the waves crash, the sea level begins to decrease around the island. The lower water level is good for collecting the best shells that were previously out of reach. Listen carefully to the ocean waves, as they indicate when the sea level will rise. Be sure to have time to return to the island with your prize shells before the next wave! Watch the sun and the moon in the night sky, as they are clues to the sea's behavior.</p><p>Updates:</p><p>2.3.17<br/></p><p>[x] add \"on walk\" scuttle sound effect<br/>[x] Add underwater sound effect for drowning<br/>[x] Cleaner death loop<br/>[x] Cleaner scene transitions<br/>[x] Add bigger point shells far out into sea<br/>[x] Added custom graphics for score text<br/>[x] Fixed alpha issue with score</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c4a8f2c339cbefde70e853955fcfdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BunnyGun"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
