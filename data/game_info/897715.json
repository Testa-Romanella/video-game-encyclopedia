It starts with a blank board and makes \u00a0between 5 and 25 random moves on it to create a solvable puzzle. The game does not save the random levels, so they can not be reset.<br/></p>\n<p>Level 0 in each setting is intended as a sandbox to figure out the mechanics. As soon as you make it blank again after messing with it you progress to level 1. Or you can just press the <em>Next </em>button.</p>\n\n<p>Happy holidays :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d32/d325dec0c37498b7190cef9dd56af5a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oddur"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
