{"id": 16224, "slug": "iron-brigade", "name": "Iron Brigade", "name_original": "Iron Brigade", "description": "<p>Iron Brigade (formerly Trenched) is a third-person tower defense in the setting of the World War I.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The main &quot;hero&quot; of the action is Trench \u2014 thus the former name \u2014 which is a warrior-robotic creature defending the player&#39;s base from the upcoming waves of enemies with escalating difficulty. In contrary to the typical games of the genre, there is only one unit modifying itself according to the mission&#39;s needs. The trench is highly moveable \u2014 the placement can be changed to bent a course of the battle towards the victory. The broken machines can be repaired, and the goal of almost every level is to defend U.S.S. McKinley base.<br />\nThe game does not feature any difficulty settings and playable in cooperative mode. After the primary campaign, there are survival missions available. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game swiftly changes its settings from the absurd, dieselpunk variation of the World War I to the anti-Russian campaign set somewhere on Mars with no storyline tying these events whatsoever. The mission giveaway is monotonous, and the whole story centers around the scheme including fighting with the mobs, fighting with the boss of the location, walking down to the headquarters and acquiring new quest with the seemingly little bonds to the previous one \u2014 the scheme repeats itself until the end of the story.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2010-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/821382933bf3dd44a9c79a5ab04b5881.jpg", "website": "http://www.ironbrigadegame.com", "rating": 2.77, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 996, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 31, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 69, "ratings_count": 98, "suggestions_count": 584, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 98, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Double Fine Productions"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
