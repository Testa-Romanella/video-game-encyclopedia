Hit the switches, avoid the enemies, collect the points, and SURVIVE THE TORTURE throughout all of the various puzzle worlds! With over 300 maps, you'll be punching your monitor nonstop (or throwing your phone if you buy on Google Play)!</p><p>Don't worry, the game has been fully playtested and is in fact beatable. You might die a few times though.</p><p>If you want an impossible challenge, collect tons of points to unlock TOTAL TORTURE MODE that is hidden away somewhere. Be warned: it's most likely impossible and is just thrown in there as a joke. If you beat it though, you unlock a nice upgrade that will be useless by the time you get it! What could be better than that?</p><p>Note: This game is meant to be point and click. You can move with the arrow keys but enemies will do insane damage.</p><p>Developed with RPG Maker MV</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e31/e31aa7683f6381c2a27f70f3a992acc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DLHB Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
