Perfectly done.<br/><br/>---<br/>LOVE THIS GAME!!! by Dezign09<br/>\"I would recommend this game to anyone! It's fun relaxing and challenging all at the same time.\"<br/><br/>---<br/>IT'S REALLY GOOD by Turbo444<br/>Five months of daily play, and it\u2019s still fun. Many puzzle games have levels that get progressively more difficult, until I get to the point where it\u2019s just not fun anymore, and I stop playing. Wooden Block Puzzle has just one level. It is always the same... never gets harder to play. But it never gets boring, and has actually become more fun the longer I play, because the possibilities are endless, and the challenge is built-in. You can try to beat your own high score... or not. Very well-crafted by some genius developer. Thanks, Dev.<br/><br/>---<br/>PERFECTLY DISTRACTING by MonsterNmyHead<br/>You ever get really bored? Ever turn on some music but didn't wanna dance but stillllll you wanted to do SOMETHING? Get tired of waiting for a text back? Are you anxious? Is the party you're at super lame?? Play this game and none of those things will be a problem ever again. Highly addicting game. So simple. You're in competition with yourself. And honestly what's better?<br/><br/>---<br/>WOOD PUZZLE by Houston Astros Fan<br/>\"Good thought for eye and hand. Moves fast enough to keep you interested. I love it!\"<br/><br/>---<br/>LOTS OF FUN by Kym6erlee<br/>\"I just recently downloaded this game and after the first game, I was absolutely in love. It's challenging entertaining, and requires a degree of concentration but without too much stress. Very similar to Tetris but the tiles do not rotate so you need to place them as they appear and the set of three tiles will not be replaced until the three present are situated on the board. That's how you will either win or lose the game. I recommended it.\"<br/><br/>---<br/>WOODEN BLOCKS by Merina<br/>\"Ok, I hate the friend who introduced this fun and addicting game to me yesterday. I sat and played for 90 minutes straight, telling myself \"only one more game... \"I LOVE this game. Just when I think I've outsmarted the game it comes back and shows me who's boss. It's an easy, clever game, much the old Tetris, just not as fast. If you like fitting puzzle pieces together then this is your game.\"<br/><br/>---<br/>PUZZLE FUN by A oSmile for fun<br/>\"Brings me back so many years when first I played Tetris a fun game then a fun game now.
