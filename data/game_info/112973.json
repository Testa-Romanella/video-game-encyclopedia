{"id": 112973, "slug": "bacteria-itch", "name": "Bacteria (itch)", "name_original": "Bacteria (itch)", "description": "<p>'Bacteria' is a new puzzle game from the creators of 'Energy Balance' and 'Energy Cycle'.<br/><br/>This game is based on the rules of the cellular automaton 'Life' created by John Horton Conway in 1970.<br/>(Want to know more? Read how it works here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)<br/><br/>In 'Bacteria' there is a square-shaped game field in a stable state. You need to add a certain number of cells into it so that after a few steps the field will be cleared. You can draw a single point, or use standard 'Life' patterns like \"Glider\" (the cells move at a certain angle) and \"Lightweight spaceship (LWSS)\" (the cells move in a straight line).<br/><br/>Depending on the difficulty level, the player can use a smaller area to add new cells.</p><p>'Bacteria' on STEAM Greenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=576560695<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f0eb756fa39fc07d203dd4c92d9ef7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pinkerator"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
