I loved the art concept but my review board didn't think the game play was right for the research.

The game never made the leap to HTML (something was way off with my code. Here I\u00a0used a code base from the GameMaker asset store by Bygdle called the \"Basic platform game example\" and added features, music, assets, and level design. I tried to reuse as much of the art I created for the original as I\u00a0could.</p>\n<p>Wasn't going to work on this but was inspired by Salvage Jam to complete it (my first game jam).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2cbb7cd16d6d4154fe86efb3c405185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gywair"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
