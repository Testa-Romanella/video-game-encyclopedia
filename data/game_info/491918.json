SimCasino truly gives you the full experience:  <br/><strong>Graphics. Gameplay.   AND Full Soundtrack, from world-renowned composer Jerry Martin!</strong><h3>Fast-Paced &amp; Easy to Learn</h3>We aren't in the 90s anymore;  we're in the era of instant gratification and SimCasino aims to give you plenty of that.  You have full control, and you have it now; construction is rapid, inventory is easy to manage, and the controls &amp; mechanics feel so familiar that you'll be building mega casino/hotels your very first day.<h3>You are the Casino.  Does the House Always Win?</h3>The saying is that \"The house always wins\" -- but is that actually true?  Thieves, cheaters, and criminals can tilt the odds against you and while you can set the odds, you need to make sure that the customers are getting some entertainment value if you want them to be repeat customers.  You will want to incentivize customers to join your VIP Player's Club so that you can track them, and reward them with \"comps\" to keep the money machines printing!<h3>Get Creative - Customize &amp; Design Every Aspect</h3>This isn't a one size fits all kind of game.  There's virtually no limit to your ability to be creative.  Build luxury hotels or cheap no-frills casinos. Choose every finish, from the walls &amp; flooring styles, the lighting, the counter-top &amp; bar-top materials, even the restroom stalls.  You are the architect, the designer, the operations specialist, and ultimately <strong>you own the casino!</strong><h3>Dynamic &amp; Event-Driven Gameplay Experience</h3>Incredibly dynamic &amp; extremely event-driven gameplay where you'll experience many emergent behaviors from customers &amp; the patrons of your gaming establishment.  This provides tons of opportunity to have fun in SimCasino, regardless of your play-style:   you may prefer to focus on the design aspects, or perhaps you're focused on creating an ultra-high efficiency resort, or if you want to be purely profit-driven and truly challenged then the criminals, cheaters, and petty thieves are always looking for an edge.  <br/><strong>No matter your play style, SimCasino is ALL-IN &amp; you are covered!</strong><h3>Deep Gameplay</h3>While SimCasino is extremely easy to learn &amp; you'll rapidly be building Bellagio-class resorts, that doesn't mean that it lacks depth.  On the contrary, your gameplay experience is tailored to you;  you can go as deep (or as shallow) as you'd like!    If you want to manage every last chip in the casino's vault, micro-manage the games &amp; odds on slot machines, keep tabs on every deck of cards, or even design the ultimate high-efficiency staff schedule &amp; security patrol scheme -- you can do all of that, and a lot more.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T07:56:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86ff4d896bbff221d117800a2b425e30.jpg", "website": "https://www.simcasinogame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 41, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 418, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LVGameDev"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LVGameDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
