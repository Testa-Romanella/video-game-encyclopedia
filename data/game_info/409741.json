The style of the game is inspired by Hotline Miami. The music in the games is by Zeropage (https://www.youtube.com/user/zeropage). Zeropage is a Swiss music collective that makes weird enough music for me to like it. To honor this artist, I called the game Zero Balloon.</p>\n<p>If you want more cool games like this one\u00a0please consider donating. it will help a lot!\u00a0You can donate either here\u00a0or with Bitcoin to this address:\u00a03N2kz2Gj9u5CFrbe8zHmFDnXbQaCEJoydr</p>\n<p>ALL people who donate will be listed in\u00a0the about page in the game!
