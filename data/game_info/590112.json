I created this completely on my own and every model asset and code is done by myself.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a simple maze solving game, where you take the controll of a drone and navigate it through 3 unique levels with it's own features. Including a fourth tutorial level.\u00a0<br/>But be aware that you have just a limited distance from the next active radio tower. Find their buttons to activate them and also find a way to open the doors in your way.<br/></p>\n<p>The mazes become more complicated as also different levels of height are included in the later levels.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T08:16:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee4/ee4e0ea27c54fbe3853c6545226b140a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philipp Olawsky"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
