You play as an astronaut seeking refuge on the space station after your own escape pod has floated through space for some time. While exploring the station, you will uncover the story behind what happened before your arrival and make your escape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game takes you through a short series of tasks that you must completed in order to board an escape pod and continue along in your search for rescue.\u00a0 While completing these tasks, you will encounter voice logs from the past and learn more about the people who once inhabited the station. Do your best to be cautious, because an alien monster\u00a0will hunt you as you scramble for safety.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is made of Google Cardboard but should be compatible with other\u00a0VR devices as there are no buttons used. All interactions are fueled by using gaze to interact. This was an interesting challenge for the team because we feel that it forces us to use limited resources to fuel our design. Overall, we are happy with the way things turned out.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game was created as a final project for the virtual reality course taught by MJ Johns at The University of Texas at Austin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Laksha Parajuli - Programmer</p>\n<p>Garret Wied - Programming and Design</p>\n<p>Kevin Benavides - Design and Sound</p>\n<p>Assets:\u00a0\u00a0Low Poly Space Station by David Stenfors,\u00a0\"Heartbeat, Regular, Single, 01-01, LOOP.wav\" by InspectorJ,\u00a0Communicator (handpainted) by Alex Martire,\u00a0True Horror - Crawler by Witch-A-Twin Studios,\u00a0Diesel Truck Idling Front by ibirdfilm,\u00a0sticker peel by tim.kahn,\u00a0\"False Reality\" Sci-Fi Horror Music by Somnium Music,\u00a0Alien Creature Sounds 1 by royalty free music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/595c1ba0dc6005921355617927ab56ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["garretwied", "Kevin Melons"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
