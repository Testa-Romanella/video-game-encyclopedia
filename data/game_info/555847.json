You can help me in development process by report or give feedback about the game in my discord server.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea is, I always want to play a futuristic city-building game that take place in very sci-fi world after I was experience with Anno series and Factorio since 2014 so I decided to make my very own game with that settings, it should have a somewhat complex production chain like in Factorio and I like the idea of having many population class in Anno. That is where the basic idea of Complex SKY come from.</p>\n<p>Discord Server :\u00a0https://discord.gg/ZgdmUN7<br/>Youtube Channel :\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJl7sX7FhCyS6vQs8moMXeA<br/>Facebook Page :\u00a0\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/CPSKYProject<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Currently have</strong></p>\n<ul><li>25+ Building &amp; Module</li><li>50+ Items - 60+ Technologies</li><li>4 Resources Type</li><li>2 Population Class</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Alpha </strong>--[\u00a0In progress ]--</p>\n<p>Already working on\u00a0adding game contents</p>\n<p><strong>Beta</strong>\u00a0 --[ Early Access ]--</p>\n<ul><li>Achievement</li><li>Real Tutorials</li><li>World<ul><li>Expandable Building Area</li></ul></li><li>Building<ul><li>Augmentation</li></ul></li><li>Population<ul><li>Researcher Class\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Resources<ul><li>Wealth</li></ul></li><li>Quest<ul><li>Story Quest</li></ul></li><li>Story</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Release</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Not have any plan yet</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>A game developed by UNITY Engine</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d5642729789bab80b3206da550c03939.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 402, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Momosundeass"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
