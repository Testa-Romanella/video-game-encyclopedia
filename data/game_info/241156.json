He embarks on a quest for revenge by heading into the Forest of Evil to become stronger and to prove to those who doubted him that he has the makings of a great hero! Instead of acquiring strength and skills in the forest Damien instead encounters a demon who grants him an 'unexpected' power that will help him stick it to those beautiful ladies from the guild who made fun of him.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith his new found powers in tow Damien sets out to get his revenge on the four people who laughed him out of the guild's recruitment event.
