Hurly Worm is a space shooter with only one shot... and instead of a ship there is a worm... and instead of space, there is a lovely papercraft meadow. Made in 36 hours with Unity and a Cricut paper cutter.</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys or A &amp; D to move the worm left and right. Hold and release the space bar to throw the pear at the hungry birds. Hold longer to throw faster and farther, and get a running start before throwing to deal extra damage.</p>\n<p>If you cannot get past the menu screen, click into the game window before pressing the space bar.</p>\n<p>The hurly worm gets the bird!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39c3eefc4644ade404e2fe19cd9e32e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OrionBH"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
