The knight here runs endlessly in hopes of finding his girlfriend, however never succeeds. Who knows maybe you can save him from this endless cycle of pain? (Sorry, you cant :(. This question was for literary purposes only, and is not a hint. But game is still fun and you should really give it a go)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T13:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c1ead43a71ea72bdc420f190bc46c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZikPin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
