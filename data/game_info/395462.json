At the same time, having experienced the loss of a close person, the challenge of finding a new connection is even more meaningful.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As Sam decides to go outside to talk to new people, the realisation kicks in that social media has taken over the neighbourhood, with people immersed in their smart phones and Spacebook culture.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game portrays some artificial connections through dialogue, designed to intrigue the player to relate certain thought processes to their reality. The four main personalities that the player can engage with are based on researched personalities, two of which are artificially inflated, another who has developed defensiveness because of flaky relationships, and another who is genuine and capable of recognising artificial connections.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spacebook's only goal is to provoke thought and raise awareness through play, designed with a focus on learning instead of gameplay mechanics.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Game:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Originally inspired by a game jam theme called 'Connect'.\u00a0Built in Gamemaker 2 using music created in FL Studio. Portraits were designed in Aseprite, sprites and background taken from www.kenney.nl.</p>\n\n<p>Made and produced by The Llama Concept\u00a0http://thellamaconcept.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:54:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edbca27add926013c0ef92ce5a407760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["purul3nt"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
