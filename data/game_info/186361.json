There's always Infinite Battle which allows you to fight infinite waves of enemies for the highest score.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move</li><li>Space to shoot</li><li>Ctrl to use screen-wipe weapon</li></ul>\n<p>PRO TIPS:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Only the Helicopters and the Jets drop upgrades, health crates and extra ammo.</li><li>Look out for the grey mines. (Though I won't tell you why... Mwahaha...)</li><li>If you're getting overwhelmed by enemies, don't forget your screen wipe weapon (Press Ctrl). Remember though, you only have one and if you use it, you'll have to find some extra ammo.</li><li>The game doesn't save your progress (Except if you win) so be extra careful if you have low health. If you die, that's it!</li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<ul><li>Thanks to Spring Enterprises Independent for the cool desert stage music \"Suez Crisis\" Here's a link to the profile:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/users/...</li><li>SketchyLogic for all the other awesome music.
