Probably never doing that again, just not my thing,\u00a0but it was a good experience.</p>\n<p>Extra special shout out to Michael Outlaw who created all of the audio, and there's a lot it! I'd never worked with audio before, and I\u00a0still have a lot to learn, but it was really cool.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to Kenney, for the amazing tools and fonts!\u00a0I used Asset Forge and KenShape for the art.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips for the game...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Your trail damages the boss, but it's not nearly as damaging as the asteroids</li><li>Keep the boss near, but keep moving to spread your damage around, the lesser enemies are weak</li><li>The top and bottom of the level are bounded, try to stay towards the middle</li><li>Don't let anything get <em>too</em> close, things can still kill you while they're blowing up</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://kenney.nl/documentation/asset-forge</li><li>https://tools.kenney.nl/kenshape/</li><li>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</li><li>https://www.reaper.fm/</li><li>https://shop.line6.com/software/plug-ins/helix-native.html</li><li>https://www.toontrack.com/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Half the \"feature\" work</li><li>Double the UX work</li><li>Splitting efforts between coding and art is fun and frustrating</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45ecc3a98f9a761ac3878b9c805b7c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["THEjoezack"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
