The Duel Card Game depicts that conflict using a set of tiles that players will claim over the course of a game. By tactically placing ownership markers and taking tiles, you will achieve the majority control required to influence the countries and powers of Europe.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Four different opponents, each with their own personality, challenge you at a variety of difficulty levels to make the game very replayable. <br/><br/>Web of Power Card Game: The Duel is built on the same successful MobileEuroCard platform that was used to create Michael Schacht&amp;#39;s Gold and Reiner Knizia&amp;#39;s High Society, Kingdoms, Money, and Modern Art: The Card Game. Simple gestures allow you to take tiles and move markers. Everything is animated, for a colorful play experience.<br/><br/>Previously released as the tabletop game Richelieu, The Duel has now returned to its intended Dark Ages theming.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afd/afd478decf92af574eab96f17b9a6079.jpeg", "website": "http://www.rpg.net/iphone/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Skotos Tech"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Skotos Tech"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
