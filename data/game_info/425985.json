A game where you can simulate an Easter egg hunt within the comfort of your own home!</p>\n<p>One player aims to hide as many eggs as they'd like in a fantasy like park, and then they hand off the controls to another player to find them all!</p>\n<p>This is far from our normal genre of horror and adventure, and we're still aiming to add more in the meantime before Easter! Let us know what you'd like to see!</p>\n<p>Made in a couple days while stuck in quarantine :P hope everyone out there is doing well and is able to enjoy the holiday coming up!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>QUICK QA</strong><br/>Does the browser version work?</p>\n<ul><li>It should on chrome and internet explorer! Haven't tested any others</li></ul>\n<p>My computer security is blocking the game after downloading, how can I still play it?</p>\n<ul><li>Depends on your computer, usually there is a little more info button you can click to then choose `Run Anyways` but if not just leave a comment and I can help you out!</li></ul>\n<p>Will you be adding more to this?</p>\n<ul><li>I have a couple more small features I'd like to add before Easter, but other than that only if you all really want it!</li></ul>\n<p>How can I play this with people remote?</p>\n<ul><li>Currently there's no feature for that yet, but you could always do a screenshare with someone that you know and remote desktop! (never do that with a stranger though, some people might not be so nice)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>ABOVE ALL<br/></strong>Enjoy and comment on what you like and what you'd like to see added and I'll see what I can do!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/2561b696dbe90b3a0f096a6186fe18ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Vicimus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
