{"id": 492884, "slug": "adventure-frankenstein", "name": "Adventure Frankenstein", "name_original": "Adventure Frankenstein", "description": "<p>Help Igor plunder graves and gather enough body parts for Doctor Frankenstein to build a Monster. Then play as the Monster gathering more body parts to build a Bride. The madness doesn't end there. She collects even more parts to build herself a pet dog.</p>\n<p>Be careful of the hallowed ground at grave sites. If you step on it, you might die. Be sure to dig at the X until each grave is plundered. Use your shovel to shoo the murder of crows away. Don't try to push past them. Crows are fierce. Move on from platform to platform avoiding obstacles and do your best to plunder 10 graves before you return to the lab. For every 10 graves you plunder, you get a new body part. Build and then play as Frank, the Bride, and even a cute puppy named Spot. By the end you have one big creepy family.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys control left , right, dig, and jump. (Space bar controls dig as well, if that's more comfortable for you.) Better yet, play with a controller.\u00a0Use your dig button as a weapon to shoo the crows out of your way, fight the angry mob of villagers, and battle other strange beasts that go bump in the night. Click the white arrow in the top right corner if you fall spiraling endlessly into the abyss. It can happen.</p>\n<p>Each time you plunder 10 graves, you must then find secret passages, lifts, and tunnels that take you back to the lab so you can build your monster. Plunder 200 graves and you complete the Adventure Frankenstein challenge.</p>\n<p>Spooky Music provided by my good friend,\u00a0Mark Harvey.</p>\n<p>This game will soon be available on Google Play and iOS App Store with ads and reward videos.
