You wake up in hell where some of your favorite pre gluten-allergen diagnosis\u00a0foods are falling from the freaking sky! You must survive as long as you can with the 5 points of health the programmer of this cruel simulation has provided you with. Good luck lol.</p>\n<p><strong>Bread</strong>: A staple in the diet of a normal gluten enjoyer. These babies come down at a respectable speed, not too fast and not too slow. They'll run you <em>1 point</em> of damage if you're bad enough to not dodge them.</p>\n<p><strong>Croissant</strong>: Delicious with butter. These bad boys come in hot and hard (oh yeah) and deal <em>1 point</em> of damage to your little noggin.</p>\n<p><strong>Donut</strong>: Comes with sprinkles. Now these delicious breakfast pastries will be coming down slooooow. BUT, if you suck so bad that you manage to get hit in your stupid face by a pink donut you're health is going down by <em>2 points</em>. So don't suck.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my stupid game!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T08:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c52cf15fa0f33cc623336a82744b1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OracularFallout"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
