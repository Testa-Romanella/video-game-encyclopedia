It's no longer only a feat of finding which monochrome lights to toggle on/off to turn (or transition) the whole board off, but <strong>it's now a feat of figuring out which colours to cycle through, where</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>When the game starts, the computer will do a set of random moves, therefore <strong>every game you play is solvable</strong>. To change a light's colour, click on it or an adjacent light. Read the next paragraph for an explanation about how the colours affect each other. To cycle between the turquois, magenta, and yellow toggle modes, click the button labelled \"colour.\" If you give up on the current puzzle, click \"reset\" and it will give you a new set of lights. If you want to make the game easier or harder for yourself, click the \"size\" button, which then will cycle through different sizes of the board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>explanation:\u00a0The uses 3-bit lights, those being\u00a0red on/off, green on/off, and blue on/off. When you click on a light, it will toggle the corresponding two rgb\u00a0on/off in the light clicked and its adjacent lights: Turquois is green and blue;\u00a0magenta is red and blue;\u00a0and yellow is red and green.\u00a0Because of this,\u00a0<strong>using a colour on a different\u00a0one yields the third colour</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794d1e3f035c7e4ab31b68e601ba35a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["valley15-2"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
