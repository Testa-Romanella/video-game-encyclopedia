That being said, this game is in very early alpha, if you all could test it and let me know what you find that should be changed or added, I'd be greatly appreciative!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Cyber Stryker is a 2D platformer with characteristics similar to Megaman X /Zero, Sonic the Hedgehog, but with it's own feel as well. The game is about a computer program, Xeno, and his fight to stop an evil group of programs as they ravage the Net. Some of the songs used in this demo are only place holders while I make the full soundtrack myself, this demo consists of a single level, made up of 3 rooms and a boss fight. I hope you enjoy and please stick to constructive criticisms, thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38c67a6a6c14951104c0e200ce86ff09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jnote2592"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
