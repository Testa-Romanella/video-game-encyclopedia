Help Honest Rod crank down the mileage in all the gently pre-owned cars in his lot in this score chaser.</p>\n<p>Crank the odometers as fast as you can during the time limit, but don\u2019t crank too fast, or you\u2019ll break something and Rod will have to sell the car as-is. Your score is based on how much \u201cvalue\u201d you \u201cadd\u201d to these \u201cclassic\u201d cars before time runs out.</p>\n<em>\u201c</em><em>Honest Rod\u2019s Rollback Rally</em><em>\u00a0<em>is by far my favorite game in this game jam \u2013 honest!\u201d - Honest Rod</em></em>\n\r\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t honest, why would I call myself Honest Rod?\u201d - Honest Rod\r\n\r\nStrategy Guide\r\n<p>The goal is to crank the odometers to as close to 0 as possible (without going too far and rolling over to 999,999!), as quickly as possible without cranking too fast. Each car has a maximum cranking speed \u2013 go over it and you\u2019ll cause damage that may jam the odometer and force you to sell the car as is. But crank too slowly and you won\u2019t be able to sell as many cars during the time limit.</p>\n<p>You can sell the \u00a0car you\u2019re working on at any point.\u00a0You\u2019ll get\u00a0the most value per car by cranking the odometer all the way to 0, but this may not be worth the time it takes on every car if you\u2019re shooting for the highest possible total income. The lower the mileage on the odometer, the more \u201cvalue\u201d\u00a0you\u2019ll add by reducing it even further. For example, cranking a 500,000mi car down to 300,000 won\u2019t add much value, but cranking a 70,000mi car to 1,000 miles takes a lot less cranking and makes the car seem brand new.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t try what you learn in this game in real life. Honest Rod is just his nickname, not a statement of fact, much like how Red Bull doesn\u2019t actually give you wings.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Special thanks to Kenney for the car assets,\u00a0SONNISS for audio samples, and Panic for making\u00a0the Playdate.
