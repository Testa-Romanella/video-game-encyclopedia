Your knife which you have from the start. Weapons that you can find in the level like a cleaver which you can spin with and touch the enemies all around you. A bottle of champagne which you can use to shoot with.\u00a0And a broom to \u2026 hum \u2026 wipe the floor, I guess? You can only carry one of the three weapons in the map at once.</p>\n<p>Close all the kitchen cabinets to slow down the invasion. Be careful, that does not mean it will stop them for long.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You will fight 3 kinds of vegetables, carrots, eggplants and potatoes. The carrots are the fastest.
