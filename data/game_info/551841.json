I dare you.</strong>\n\n<p><strong>So you're here, and you want to play a visual novel right? You saw some hot 2D characters, and you want to indulge yourself with some self projection\u00a0on the side\u00a0to pass the time. Well, I made this specifically for\u00a0<em>you</em>, if that's the case.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>If you're interested in the following, such as urban fantasies, attractive characters with sombre back-stories which make them all the more appealing, revolts against corrupt governments and maybe a little bit of sexual tension, then I'm right with you. Welcome to the\u00a0clich\u00e9 side of visual novels, but this time, I'm going to add a bit of\u00a0<em>spice</em>. Throw in a depressed MC as well a flare of equally, mentally ill characters amongst a team of vigilantes in a fabricated realm, and you have VivaCity baby.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Choose your name and gender. The MC will not be featured in any art scenes, because the MC will be who you make them to be.\u00a0</li><li>Four romanceable characters currently available to play.\u00a0<em>Note: Yohan's and Anika's routes will not be available until\u00a0<strong>after\u00a0</strong>the whole game is released.</em></li><li>The demo is 20,000-25,000 words, with each chapter that will follow\u00a0roughly the same length.\u00a0</li><li>No character descriptions/charts here. You can play the game, and get to know them yourself.</li><li>Play until the end of the demo and each chapter for a special art scene.</li></ul>\r\nPlease make sure to read the disclaimer at the beginning of the game.\r\n<p>The MC that you will be playing suffers with a heavy dose of anxiety and depression, along with a huge inferiority complex.\u00a0 Other romanceable/side characters also suffer with certain other mental illnesses, because let's face it, more of us have mental health problems than we'd like to admit. Of course, a lonely and sad MC isn't rare to come across. Just be prepared for some extreme internal dialogue, because we've all been there and you know it. But if you're sensitive against, dare I say, relatable dark thoughts then maybe this isn't the game for you. If it isn't, then thank you for stopping by and have a wonderful day.<br/></p>\n<p>If it\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em> your kind of game so far, then look no further.</p>\n<p>Please download the demo below, which will take you roughly a couple of hours to complete (or if you're a fast reader like me, maybe 40 minutes) and get back to me with what you think. This entire game will likely be a huge work in progress, because I alone have attempted to make a game with zero game-making experience from scratch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Further disclaimer: if this doesn't open in browser, please try installing it on the itch.io app.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, I hope you enjoy playing VivaCity!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:32:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8f/f8fdf8d3dc7d5179fa421b38bf51ba05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["rusicariaGAMES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
