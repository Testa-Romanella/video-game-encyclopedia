The people there lived in constant fear that every day was going to be their last. In their desperation they turned to an old and terrible god for protection. The god offered to rid the valley of monsters if the people of Og agreed to worship it. A pact was struck and the old god sealed the monsters of the valley in an effigy. The people of Og rejoiced and for a time everything was well. But as the centuries passed the people of Og started forgetting about the god who gave them protection, and the pact that was struck. They started neglecting the devotion they where expected to show their protector and the old god was displeased by this. The final straw came when foreign preachers entered the valley and convinced the people of Og to turn away from worshiping their savior. In its anger the old god shattered the effigy and released the monsters back into the valley.<br/><br/>The people of Og where forced to flee lest they be destroyed. In their desperation they once again turned to the old god for protection. The god agreed to restore the effigy and seal away the monsters once more if the people of Og agreed to never again cease their worship of it. The god also required a test of faith. Someone needed to go into the valley and bring all the pieces of the effigy back together. Many have tried, but so far none have succeeded in restoring the effigy, and now it is your turn to try and bring peace to the Valley of Og.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T04:01:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/723a42c269ab5cf36c2ee731349d8cf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daGusto"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["daGusto"], "esrb_rating": null}
