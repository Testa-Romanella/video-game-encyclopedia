You will have to use your <strong>reflexes </strong>through the four seasons of the game to bring back trees and animals, but beware of the dark matter!</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>To pass a level, you just have to make <strong>50%</strong> of the planet. It is not really difficult and even rather <strong>relaxing</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are looking for <strong>difficulty</strong>, you can try to do <strong>100%</strong> of each level!<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\r\nJUST A DEMO\r\n<p><strong>Flore </strong>is still in development. Here you can find a demo of 4 levels. The full game will contain about 36 unique levels with bosses, epic planets and many other surprises!</p>\n<p>Released on <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Switch</strong> if we can!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/30768b5e03aee7c6e10c3d0cbc6bb49e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SachetD'Graines"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
