However, we have decided to go for a more simulation approach, as an Initial D game like that does not exist. Most car systems are simulated, albeit with grossly simplified models. Examples of such systems are twin turbos (spooling separately), limited-slip differentials, ATTESA (GTR), anti-lag, anti-roll bars and much more.  A unique game mode, &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;, is also made for multiplayer, where a driver has to keep up or overtake the driver in front.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-10T07:00:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/99910179ecbf9e71166c40f9e1215ba8.jpg", "website": "https://initialunity.online/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
