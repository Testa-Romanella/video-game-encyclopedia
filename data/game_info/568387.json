The issue ? They suck.<br/>You're gonna have to help them... By controling the enemies and try to lose the fights ! <em>( Controls down below\u00a0)</em><br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategy is the key</strong><strong> :</strong> each enemy has his own set of skills that you can turn against them !</p>\n<p><strong>Estimated time :</strong> 15 min<br/>The game got 3 fights (last one being a boss. Trust me : you wanna see it XD)<br/>Don't forget to rate the game for the Wowie jam !</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play :</strong></p>\n<p>- <strong><em>left</em></strong> click on an option to select it.<br/>- You can only select a skill if you have enough Magic to use it. (Purple stat)<br/>- When your Heart reaches 0 (red stat) you win... I mean lose... I mean... You can continue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In case of problem :</strong><br/>Cheat/debug commands : press 1, 2 or 3 to go directly to the fight 1, 2 or 3<br/>The mac and html versions have barely been tested but they should work just fine.<br/>Do not hesitate to report any bug.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips if you struggle (spoiler) :</strong></p>\n<p><em>Fight 1 :\u00a0 increase your d\u00e9fense with Self Hug. When Swordman uses Plot Hole, he will deal a lot of damage. (The more your d\u00e9fense is high, the more Plot Hole deals dmg)</em></p>\n<p><em>Fight 2 : Use PolyGun, it has a chance to one-shot Hexagun. If you use Deep Gaze in the same turn, the heroes are very less likely to take dmg.</em></p>\n<p><em>Boss : Like Fight 1, Plot Hole can higly damage the boss if you increase your defense with Upvote. But first you need to increase your max amount of Magic with Spam because Upvote cost more than your current amount of Magic.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Credits :<br/>Art &amp; dev : Dark Peace<br/>Music &amp; Sfx : J.A.X<br/>(I'm a big dum and I credited J.A.X as F.A.X in the game's credits.
