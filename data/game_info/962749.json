Swiggart was a very rich man and he had a lot of so-called friends.  When he discovered that his days were numbered, to separate out the posers, he built an Escape Room filled with many of his life passions and pursuits.  His true friends would be able to see what really mattered, and they would be able to escape The Room in an allotted time.  Those who didn't know him so well would fail, and accordingly, they would be denied any claim to his surviving estate.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe time limit is 1 hour.  To escape the room, players will need to solve riddles, play games, and complete puzzles.  Games and puzzles include a cipher, a slide puzzle, Sudoku with colored shapes, and a memory challenge.  There are hidden clues and hidden objects, and there are a few hidden surprises.  One might also find a piano to practice on.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T03:34:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e17177e25321d29e90223a5774a8833.jpg", "website": "https://www.gewalyart.com/Swiggart", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GJ Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GJ Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
