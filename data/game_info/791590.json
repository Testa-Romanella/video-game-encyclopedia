The solution is called \"Stop touching my ball\".</p>\n<p>The game is meant to be played on a phone but works on a computer too.</p>\n<p>Click and hold (or touch your screen) and drag to aim. \u00a0Hold \"space\" or the on screen button to build power. Release to shoot.</p>\n<p>The goal is to sink all the red balls before the opponent sinks the yellow ones.</p>\n<p>The game was made entirely on a phone. The coding was done in the app Play.js, the 3d modelling was done in Nomad Sculpt and the audio was made in GarageBand. The game is built using React-Three/Fiber with the React-Three/Cannon physics engine.</p>\n<p>\"Stop touching my ball\" was made for the Game Dev Field Guide Monthly Game Jam 15 and took roughly 70 hours to make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T18:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d2/7d2097027c39e7c43058abe943d16566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bastisbastis"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
