KEEP ALL THE WINDOWS CLOSED.</p><p>This game was made for the 2020 PSP Halloween Game Jam. It was made in 7 days (in reality, more like 10 hours), and is a simple desperate defense game. You're studying for your final exams one late night. Suddenly a burst of thunder claps and the rain pours down, and you can hear the sound of something scratching at the windows...
