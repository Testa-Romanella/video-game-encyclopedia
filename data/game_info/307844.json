I always enjoyed the turn-based, tactical structure of combat in these games. With this project, I am attempting to develop a similar combat system from scratch, using 3D assets in place of the more traditional 2D sprites. It's going to be a challenge, as I am still learning my way around Unity and C#, but \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\" so here I go! Wish me luck! And if you're so inclined, download the project and share with me your thoughts. Thanks, and happy gaming!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current State:\u00a0 Prototype\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Very early, very rough. I'm building the systems that allow me to do things like create and add new abilities, queue and un-queue player commands, display and hide the right UI elements at the right time ... little things that we take for granted when we play these games. Currently you can:</p>\n<ul><li>Select and attack enemies</li><li>use a small number of special abilities</li><li>Win or Lose the battle</li><li>Commit commands with left-click ;\u00a0 un-do commands with [ESC].</li><li>Change camera view with [C]</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T05:50:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/37447a7d83f8f347bc270f107bcac369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SDJedi"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
