I made a mistake during the submission process so this game\u00a0didn't get submitted. Still I think it would be fun to show regardless.</p>\n<p>It's first person shooter\u00a0where gravity changes depending on what color of the target you hit. The goal is to hit all the targets and reach the exit without falling into boiling lava. I ran into a lot of technical problems during development and spent most of the time fixing bugs. Thus, only had enough time make two levels, but I think it's enough to showcase what the concept is all about.</p>\n<p>Created art, animations, code, music\u00a0and sound effects myself in 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Developer: Alex Stjernstr\u00f6m (RSlider)<br/></p>\n<p>_____________________________________</p>\n<p>[Controls]\r\n</p>\n<p>-Move: W,A,S,D</p>\n<p>-Jump: Space<br/></p>\n<p>-Aim: Mouse<br/></p>\n<p>-Shoot: Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>-Aim Down Sight: Right Mouse Button<br/></p>\n<p>-Exit Game: Escape</p>\n<p>_____________________________________</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:34:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/17223d8fbc5b955fcbb01d17ca7152fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RSlider"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
