I made Heart is Muscle as a way to teach myself Unity and was so happy with the results I've since decided to port it to steam! I hope you have as much fun going around punching things as I did making it. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you so much for looking at (and possibly playing!?) my game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Heiden", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T05:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47ecee4752fb6b2d67c24867d351a9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HeidenGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HeidenGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
