I bet you can't make it to the end. In fact, I will give you my entire life savings if you do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You play as a chubby little robot/alien dude and you must avoid carrots, snails,\u00a0 and the rest of the entire island\u00a0 because nothing is safe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wonder how you'll die first. Will you fall? Get impaled by spikes? Crash the game? I bet you'll just die from hitting your head too hard on a block.</p>\n<p>This isn't Mario because this has ice creams instead of mushrooms so you cant sue us Nintendo :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Games</strong></p>\n<p>Flicknock:\u00a0https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SyrApp.Flicknock</p>\n<p>Jumpack:\u00a0https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SyrApp.Jumpack</p>\n<p><strong>Contact\u00a0Us</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: @SyrAppGames</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/SyrAppGames\r\n</p>\n<p>Email:\u00a0SyrAppGames@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd4733ccba7fca2c4ae16c11ee194f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SyrApp"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
