You fall into an unmarked sinkhole, find remnants of a high-tech chrome-coated laboratory, and now you're stuck in a self-serving time loop with a killer robot, and you can't kill each other for WHATEVER REASON! <em>Oh well.</em> <br/>Might as well co-operate... until you break the loop, that is!</p>\r\nYou have to come together, if you want to live.\r\n<p>You're not the brightest, and neither is the robot - but, with the combined might of the two of you, you might just survive. However, the killer android is arguably in a worse position, as he's only able to replicate human behavior - <strong>YOUR BEHAVIOR!</strong></p>\n<strong>Watch out for the butterfly effect!</strong>\n<p>You know this one theory which says that the flapping of a butterfly's wings can cause a natural disaster in another part of the world?<br/>Yeah, me neither, but what I do know is that, the more rooms you clear, the more probable it is you've made a horrendous mistake a few screens back - and it won't make itself apparent for a bit.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Use A and D to <strong>move </strong>around.</li><li>Press SPACE to <strong>jump</strong>.</li><li>R to <strong>restart</strong> current level.</li><li>BACKSPACE to <strong>go back to previous level</strong>.</li><li>Q to <strong>pause the killer robot</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>!!!
