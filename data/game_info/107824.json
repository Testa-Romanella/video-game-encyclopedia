He became very depressed, delusional and often couldn't even believe his existence. An ambulance outside his house and trips to the hospital were no things out of the ordinary for him. <br/></p><p>You play as a man who wakes up in the back of an ambulance with terrible injuries to his head and spine, after the ambulance went head first into a building due to the driver losing control of the vehicle. You are unable to remember much about what happened or much about your past at all really, until you start exploring and picking up clues!!</p><p>Developer Website: https://arronburch.co.uk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/9449bcc309ab841c93dc6084a141c4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arron Burch"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
