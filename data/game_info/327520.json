In the game there will be portals that lead to the dark realm, when a card is in the dark realm their stats will change.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This way it isn't just a game about math but also about the placement of portals and cards and with cool effects I tried to make this game feel fresh and fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Art, Design,\u00a0Coding: Me!
