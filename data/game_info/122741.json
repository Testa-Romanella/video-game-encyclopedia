To survive, he must use the power of the evil slimes' plague to his advantage, and consume the slime monsters to mutate and become stronger! How long can he last, before he is overtaken by the plague?<br/></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Use your grappling hook to reel enemies towards you, then eat them to gain experience! Once you eat enough monsters, you will gain a mutation, which will better prepare you for the evil slime monster horde! But beware, with each gaining level, the horde will grow stronger! Use your knowledge and skills to survive as long as possible!</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------<br/></p><p>See the timlapse of the project here!\u00a0</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Ventuargam...</p>\n<p>Skirmish: https://skirmish.io/u/ventuar</p>\n<p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channe...</p>\n<p>Website (WIP): https://ventuargames.wordpress...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fe13e2864644bc5ecb45a914fda00dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ventuar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
