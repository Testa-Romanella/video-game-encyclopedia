As the theme was mixing two genres I decided to make a turn-based strategy/top-down shooter.</p>\n<p>The game has 2 gamemodes:</p>\n<p><strong>Player vs Player </strong>- Take turns against another player locally trying to shoot each other. The first one to shoot the opponent 3 times wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Singleplayer: -</strong> Battle against waves of enemyes that charge towards you each round.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player1:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>-Rotate clockwise/counterclockwise: A/D</p>\n<p>-Shoot/Recoil: W</p>\n<p><strong>Player2:</strong></p>\n<p>-Rotate clockwise/counterclockwise: LeftArrowKey/RightArrowKey</p>\n<p>-Shoot/Recoil: UpArrowKey</p>\n<p><strong>Escape</strong>: Exit the game.</p>\n<p>Use rotation to aim and shooting mechanic to gain points/move with recoil.</p>\n<p>The game lacks a soundtrack and valid sound and visual effects. I intend to provide these as well as improve the mechanics of the game all-around.</p>\n<p>Background Image by:\u00a01980supra from Pixabay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T04:49:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78adaa7a513f4f670d6049f910b30aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neegmo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
