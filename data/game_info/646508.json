Build ships, colonize planets and gather resources.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Just the mouse. Use the right mouse button to drag and the mouse wheel to zoom in or out. Left click for any other action, like selecting a ship.<br/></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>At the center of your industrial empire is your home planet. All the resources brought there will be used to build new ships. The rarer the resources, the better the ships.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There a four types of ships:</p>\n<ul><li>A <em>Colony ship</em> can be send to a distant planet to establish a new colony.</li><li>A <em>Speeder</em> is quick but carries only a single resource at a time.</li><li>A <em>Lorry</em> has a farther range and carries two resources.</li><li>A <em>Carrier</em> can traverse the entire galaxy and can transport three resources.</li></ul>\n<p>By default a ship only picks up resources that are relevant to planets and colonies in its route. Alternatively you can select a ship and change the resources it accepts.<br/></p>\n<p>In general a colony requires a certain amount of resources to convert them to new resources. Colonies are the key to acquire rare resources.</p>\n<p>Just to let you know, there is no end game.\u00a0Just enjoy the satisfaction of having automated ships going about their day (whatever a day means in space anyway).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T03:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a41cc9d0055ede8636c846946f3a9dc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bauke Regnerus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
