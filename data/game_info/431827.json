Instead of a pet, you must keep an adventurer alive while she fights monsters and collects loot.</p>\n<p>The adventurer performs actions herself. As she adventures she will gain gold, which the player can use. However performing actions deplete her resources: HP and hunger. If either resource is completely depleted the adventurer will die \u2620.</p>\n<p>You can replenish her resources by spending gold to play a timed mini-game. You replenish more resources the better you perform in the mini-game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nMovementActionKeyboard<br/>WASDSpacebar<br/>GamepadLeft JoystickA<p><strong>Tools</strong></p><p>Everything was made using the Pixelbox.js game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T10:42:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511b767315bc1f2ffca5062ff16738bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blearn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
