Collecting loot, you must find a bridge over the river, and get to the upper left corner of the map. There you will find the main loot. On the way there, avoid open traps. The strength of the bolt throw is minimal, but by selling the loot in the \u00abtown\u00bb, you will be able to increase it in the gym. Also in the \u00abtown\u00bb, you can buy many bolts, get medical aid, and buy a map of secret passage from scientists. You can save the game and exit it.<br/> Moving towards the main loot, you must find four shards (one in each quarter of the map). By collecting them, you will be able to push main loot to the \u00abtown\u00bb - so you will win.<br/>You can change the size of the map in the <em>settings.ini</em> file, making it harder or easier to play, and many other settings will change the graphic of the game.<br/> Have fun!</p>\n\n<p><em>*You can find some settings in <strong>settings.ini</strong> (please use settings before new game)</em><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b6e687a4aad60fdd695df96c12a96fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Xeofox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
