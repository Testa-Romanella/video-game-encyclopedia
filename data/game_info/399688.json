In this game you navigate procedural ruins, but they aren't random. Every player explores the same map, which is finite and as you explore you should find traces of your own tracks. Ladders placed in one specific spot of one specific floor will always have the same destination (there are strict rules that dictate how they work).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/019bbb4bb0444c962c0aaa45deeba751.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
