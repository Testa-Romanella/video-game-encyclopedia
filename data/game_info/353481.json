The game recreates the atmosphere of a lifelike world in a playful manner, leading the player slightly beyond the realm of reality. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe storyline unfolds on a run-of-the-mill homestead, where the main character, Mikola, lives. In pursuit of his dream, he lands in tough circumstances and finds himself facing the threat of total ruin. It would seem that this is the end for Mikola\u2014he's finished\u2014but fate offers him a second, albeit rather dangerous, chance. Mikola decides to take it without any hesitation and undertakes a risky activity that draws him into incredibly exciting, sometimes dangerous, and unpredictable adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFunny, slightly naive, but purposeful Mikola solves the challenges set before him by trial and error. Failures only strengthen his character, and the experience he gains allows him to perfect his craft, bringing him closer to his intended goal. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features the cartoonish style. The tragicomic storyline, which engenders empathy for the main character, together with the outstanding graphics and variety of quests will keep you hooked until the very end.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/7256d47328b0eec95557deb62cf24655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 120, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mikola Zaporozhsky Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mikola Zaporozhsky Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
