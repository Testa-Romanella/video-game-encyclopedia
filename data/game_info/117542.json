You as the player take control of Trump and\u00a0actually goes over to North Korea and bombs it. What will be the\u00a0aftermath of this decision? Freedom &amp; Liberty or Nuclear warfare?\u00a0 Please leave a comment\u00a0down below of what do you think could happen?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick thoughts about the subject or Maybe Not!</strong></p>\n<p>During the heavy drama with Trump and North Korea in the news lately, I took upon myself to created something that could cause conversation about this topic. I believe the idea about going to War or having a possible Nuclear warfare in the up-coming future to be a scary\u00a0thought indeed. I couldn't\u00a0imagine\u00a0how does Japan feel about this? Since they're the closest one that would be impacted the most if a war broke loose due to either side pulling the trigger to soon.\u00a0I do think, there is a major play here with China.\u00a0 anyways I know that I must be ranting or talking about nonsense lol. I hope everyone that has tried the game enjoys it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Games Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Keyboard\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Arrows - Movement</li><li>Space - Fire / Start Game</li><li>B Key - Bombs</li><li>V Key - Shield</li></ul>\n<p>PS4 Input</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick - Movement</li><li>X Button - Fire / Start Game</li><li>Square Button - Shield</li><li>Circle Button - Bombs</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Best way to play the Game!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Using an PS4 Controller</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/8845992a8abc5208e37dcbd00caa05fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jose Deschamps"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
