The program treats anything in all caps as a cryptogram.<br/>Although the solutions are limited by a time out and character limit (to prevent huge solutions from tying up your device) you can cut cryptograms down and solve for small sections.  <br/>Cryptograms can have up to 30 unique words.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b0/8b0e665ba427dc2e4cc4bd152c9f08ff.jpg", "website": "http://geniusAt.work", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Curran"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["David Curran"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
