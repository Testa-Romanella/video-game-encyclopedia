Overwhelming uncertainty spirals into the open space.<br/><strong>A mournful swamp</strong>; ruminations. Deep eyes cast a hostile stare, halting momentum.<br/><strong>A decaying desert</strong>; empty heart. Ennui erodes away will, repelling initiative.<br/><strong>A hostile tower</strong>; biting words. All comfort stolen away through expecting motion.<br/><strong>A caustic ocean</strong>; complex regrets. Sinking and deeper, a jagged suffocation.<br/><strong>A looming edifice</strong>; hopeless contrition. Blindly, all light and truth is snuffed.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is another method.<br/><br/>The world is frustrating. Vicious. Unyielding.<br/>Hesitation will allow the noise to increase only further.<br/>Go at your own pace. Know when to advance. Know when to retreat.<br/>Weaving between antimatter, thread the needle.<br/>Sometimes hope needs to be furiously wrenched from a cruel world's grip with gritted teeth.<br/><br/><br/><em><br/>-this game uses very limited text and uses a limited palette of only 4 colors, this may cause accessibility issues for some people-</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/039b89abbcd0a58f2d55f8ee1da47595.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamsBell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
