Check out the submission page!<strong>THE GAME</strong><p><em>After surviving a nuclear detonation you are left starving, irradiated and delusional. Miraculously, a bag of plum seeds also survived the blast. Planting these seeds becomes your means for survival. Radiation will mutate your plums both for better and worse. Will you succumb to radiation poisoning? Or starvation? Or will your shattered psyche become your most lethal affliction?</em></p><p><strong>Soil and Rubble </strong>is a gardening simulation with a twist: nuclear fallout periodically mutates your crops. These mutations have a variety of effects, some good and some bad. The key to survival is breeding the perfect set of mutations while fending off starvation with your less desirable fruit.</p><p>The game takes between 8-15 minutes to complete and there is a very clear ending.</p><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT</strong><p>All art and high level game code was created by myself within the 1 month development period.</p><p>The UI font that was used is Zeroes 3 by Raymond Larabie (http://www.1001fonts.com/zeroes-font.html)</p><p>Audio was licensed as CC0 or free for non-commercial use and found on freesound.org.
