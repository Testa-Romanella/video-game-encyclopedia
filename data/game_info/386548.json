{"id": 386548, "slug": "automation-empire", "name": "Automation Empire", "name_original": "Automation Empire", "description": "<p>Automation Empire is a simulation / management game all about efficiency and expansion. Start with nothing, and build up a massive interconnected industrial network of factories and machines. Economical transportation of resources will be essential to your success as an automation-engineer. Utilize every tool you have access to, including mine carts, drones. trucks, trains, and cargo rockets. Employ your ingenuity and creativity to plan out an efficient logistics network of machines to form a mechanical superorganism of production.DESIGN COMPLEX SYSTEMSHarness your creativity to engineer a beautiful machine of clockwork precision. Start with basic &quot;A to B&quot; systems utilizing simple delivery drones, but later, expand the complexity of your transportation-line as you construct an interwoven mesh of tracks in order to allocate all of your resources exactly where they need to go.<br />\nEXPAND YOUR PRODUCTIONMake it your mission to rout out all of the bottlenecks in your supply-chain. Extract and process precious metals and ores from the ground including gold, iron, and coal. Craft and refine your resources into more valuable products through the use of an optimized factory production-line.<br />\nRESEARCH NEW TECHNOLOGYUpgrade your facility\u2019s infrastructure as you discover new technologies by harnessing the power of the resources you extract. Throughout your engineering endeavors you\u2019ll gain access to advanced automated machines and systems which will further compound your production capacity.<br />\nINTEGRATE WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGSWork around your planet&#39;s naturally occurring geological formations and rough terrain as you integrate your ever expanding industrial systems. Seven different planets, with differing biomes, each present unique landforms you must factor into your base&#39;s layout.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:34:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd28ee9cdb5fd56c99341d0c9d75e5b.jpg", "website": "https://www.doghoggler.com/", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 32, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 489, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOG HOGGLER"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DOG HOGGLER"], "esrb_rating": null}
