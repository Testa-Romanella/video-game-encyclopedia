Guide Squippy to the exit, avoiding the hazards (spikes, mostly)\u00a0as you make your way through five levels. But don't worry--even if Squippy dies, he jumps right back into the action!<br/></p>\n<p><em>Squippy's Escape</em> is my first game project, and was mostly intended as a vehicle to familiarize myself with development in GameMaker: Studio and GML, and to learn the mechanics and considerations of making a 2D platformer. As someone who chronically abandons projects, another specific goal I\u00a0had was to see it to the end and create a complete, polished product that I would be proud to show off. So here it is! I\u00a0hope you check it out and enjoy!</p>\n<p>(P.S.
