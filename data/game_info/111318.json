I set the resolution to 64x64 in Godot, but then I went and changed the camera zoom to really far out without thinking about what that meant. So yeah, I'm dumb, and this game is technically disqualified from the jam xD Anyway I'll leave it up, hope you enjoy it all the same!<br/></p><p>Very short platformer made for LOWREZJAM 2018.</p>\n<p>Move quickly between checkpoints, enemies will re-spawn if you take too long. Hold up while shooting to shoot vertically. dashing in the air serves as a double jump and is necessary to reach some platforms. The player is momentarily invincible while dashing and it can be used to destroy enemies or defend against enemy attacks.
