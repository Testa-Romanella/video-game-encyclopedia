They enter the pyramid with ease, due to their expertise in the trade. Upon finding the treasure room, the pair discovered an ancient artifact. However, when one of them went to grab the artifact, they contracted a curse, which could only be cured by transferring it to another person by touching them. Given the choice between dooming their partner or dying, the pair turned on each other. Only one would get out of this pyramid alive.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:44:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f39f0078be551bdb67a90fe51080bb27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GajaGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
