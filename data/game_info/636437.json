Was it all a bad dream? An echo from another time? Whatever it was, it bears signs of something truly terrifying...<br/><br/>This little, slightly interactive game, tells a story about love, loss and pain in a world quite similar to ours. It's an emotional journey, from beginning to end<br/>and I advise having something to hug close by when the curtain falls and the game ends.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T09:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f493fcd3d4d0dd943114674652d2e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RabbitTheCreator"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
