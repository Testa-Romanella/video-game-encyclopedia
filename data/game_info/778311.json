Taps produce drips at regular intervals. The user is able to alter the interval at which each tap produces drips by turning its handle. The drips fall down the screen and will bounce off bars, causing the bar to produce a tone when they do so. The frequency and timbre of bars are adjustable by changing their length and width. Making slight changes to the environment can result in completely new musical sequences being generated.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f497ab83a2ccea51340799bc5153e27b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Finneganeganegan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
