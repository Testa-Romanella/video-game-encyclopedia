The focus of this exercise was really just porting v1 Number Wizard, which was console output only, into a UI friendly version.</p><p>I learned how to connect UI Buttons to code and vice versa. I'd previously figured out how to connect multiple scenes together in Unity but this project helped me learn a new way to do so.</p><p>A small challenge that came up was that I'm using Unity5 whereas the tutorial was using U4. It was helpful to resort to documentation to help me solve the issue. Scene loading has changed from 4 to 5 and solving that small but vital issue was rewarding. :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a97c8767593f25169305f9991b0bc0d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CraigItsFryday"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
