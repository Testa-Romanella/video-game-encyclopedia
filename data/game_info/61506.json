Work your way up from rookie in a \u201crust bucket\u201d to experienced pilot in a high-tech combat aircraft that\u2019s equipped with lots of deadly gadgets. With a variety of combat modes, futuristic arenas, multi-level craft, developed trading, and a social eco-system, you\u2019ll never have time to be bored!<strong>FEATURES</strong><strong>WELCOME TO ALTHANAR</strong><br/>Thirty years ago, a massive asteroid almost destroyed Althanar. A high-tech Dome absorbed most of the strike and now keeps the planet from total destruction. Although part of Altanar is a post-apocalyptic desert, some areas still have megalopolises, military bases, and even wilderness. Now, a serious battle for power and control of rare deuterium resources has begun. Deuterium lies at the heart of most technologies, including fueling the Dome.<strong>BATTLE FIERCELY LIKE NEVER BEFORE</strong><br/>High dynamic fights keep the player engaged throughout the battle. In order to win, reaction and tactical thinking are equally important, as well as team play and the right priorities, depending on the battle mode. A fierce soundtrack and special effects reinforce the sensation of being fully immersed in battle.<strong>BECOME THE MAKER OF A REAL DEATH MACHINE</strong><br/>Combat vehicles are made from components that the player acquires in various ways. A trustworthy machine gun, a powerful cannon, or an experimental beam gun: the choice is yours. The same goes for armor, engine, and hundreds of additional gadgets and their modifiers.<strong>BE A CRAFTSMAN OR A TRADER</strong><br/>As usual in this genre, you can outfit your ship before flight. The system of craft and trading allows you to even convert junk into a valuable part that can be sold for profit! Players will enjoy all the possibilities for customization; ship parts can be painted or patterned and decorative elements can be added.<strong>BATTLE ON THE SINGLE SERVER</strong><br/>Apart from the PC version, a version for mobile platforms and consoles is being prepared. Thanks to unique controls, players from all over the world will battle on a single server in equal conditions regardless of the platform chosen. At home, on the road, or at work: the game will always be with you.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-30T13:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29f/29f06c5bf0eae345da44bc23217e8c68.jpg", "website": "https://deuteriumwars.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Disquire"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Disquire"], "esrb_rating": null}
