I plan to make a mobile version of it, with an in-game level editor.</p>\n<p>To find your way out of the caves, you will have to cleverly\u00a0use your environment to deal with dangerous monsters. The exit doors are unlocked only after collecting a certain amount of gems. Diamonds\u00a0\u00a0are worth 3 gems, while emeralds\u00a0\u00a0are worth 1 gem and can crush your character. Your time is limited, but each gem collected gives a small time bonus.</p>\n<p>More details on the original arcade game can be found here:<br/>https://www.arcade-history.com/?n=diamond-run&amp;page=detail&amp;id=635<br/>https://classicreload.com/https%3A//classicreload.com/Diamond-Run.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T03:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b49/b491605a59cf0dd7b4b2ac3be7aa67ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bastien Joubioux"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
