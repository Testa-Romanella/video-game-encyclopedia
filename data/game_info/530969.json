You need to escape each floor, but in order to do so, <strong>you must complete the floor's</strong>\u00a0<strong>given goal before you can use the exit</strong>. There is <strong>one</strong>\u00a0green tablet on each floor that will tell you what flowers to plant and water.</p>\n<p>In order to plant the flowers do the following:</p>\n<ol><li>Bump into the \"dirt\" in order to dig up the soil</li><li>Equip the chosen flower in your\u00a0<strong>inventory</strong>\u00a0</li><li>Bump into the \"dirt\"\u00a0<strong>again</strong><strong> to place the flower</strong></li><li>Bump into the water shed (blue)<strong> to collect water</strong></li><li>Bump into the\u00a0<strong>flower placed</strong> to water it</li><li>Now the chosen flower has been watered*</li></ol>\n<p>*Each flower has different \"water requirements\". Thyme (green) requires 1 unit of water. Sage (pink) requires 2 units of water. And hydrangea (orange) requires 3 units of water. Your watering pot can hold a maximum of\u00a0<strong>6 units</strong> of water at a time.</p>\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>Master Time left his watchtower, the building that controls chronology, for unknown reasons. In his absence, time has begun to repeat itself and those within it have transformed into more hostile creatures.</p>\n<p>Knowing the watchtower's fate, the Jardinier plans to escape, taking their beloved flowers with them, (not without nurturing them first). But the Jardinier has fallen victim to a disease, meaning that time spent on each floor isn't limitless. Can they escape the watchtower and save their flowers?</p>\n\r\nPROCJAM\r\n<p>This game was made for Procjam 2020 and was my first attempt at procedural generation (ever)!
