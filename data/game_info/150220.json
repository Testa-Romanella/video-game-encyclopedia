You keep falling endlessly into a boundless world. The only thing around you is the debris from your exploded ship and from these pieces you must gather a powersource, an antenna, and an activator and combine them to a transmitter so you can transmit the signal that will ultimately save you. But you must gather the item quickly because you keep falling away from your ship and once the debris is gone, there is no hope of getting back. You will be forced to float forever in the <strong>boundless</strong> void of space.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a24/a245407582aad43418a7e7f2bcb80ec2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Andersen", "lask"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
