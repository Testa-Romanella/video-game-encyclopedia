In an effort to escape the advancing Allied forces, the Germans begin a desperate evacuation of men, machinery and the spoils of war.<br/><br/>On the outskirts of Metz, a heavily armed train of the Third Reich sits sweltering in the dead of night. On board lies a secret cargo. Renoirs, Monets, Picassos \u2013 the entire plundered art collection of France \u2013 are to be smuggled to Berlin under a cover of darkness.
