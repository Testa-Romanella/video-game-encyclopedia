Our aim for the game was a top down scrolling game where you progress through the world after defeating bosses within a certain scene. The waves and the bosses would be randomised and there would be multiple mob and boss types. Throughout the game you'd be able to pick up power ups which would provide different perks like insta-kill, double points, etc.<br/></p><p><strong>User Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Fight through waves of zombies each wave progressively more and more difficult by the number of zombies attacking. A boss will spawn every third wave which will track your movement and shoot at you.<br/>Controls:<br/>Ctrl/ Left Click- shoot<br/>W- move up<br/>A- move left<br/>S- move down<br/>D- move right</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creators:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Daniel Rhodes (Artist), Max Southerton (Artist), Jamil Ahmed (Artist)</p>\n<p>Regan Marples (Coder), Ashley Sprules (Coder)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37ab8f1a6036a4a20176001cc967f099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Rhodes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
