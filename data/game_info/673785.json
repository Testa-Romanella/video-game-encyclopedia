But the Vatican is a massive, bustling city, full of twisting avenues and winding corridors and so many oubliettes, so what are you chances that you'll ever find the pope's office somewhere in this edifice? <br/></p>\n\n<p>WARNING!!! This is a camp grotesque horror story inspired by the works of Franz Kafka and Kobo Abe. It contains VERY objectionable material and should not be played by sensitive players.
