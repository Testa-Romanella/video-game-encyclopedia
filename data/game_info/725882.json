We'll be testing your cognitive and motor functions as you pilot a little ship around a variety of environments. The ship is very touchy, quite expensive, and it will break on just about everything. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't worry though, you'll only be graded on your performance! We've established strict metrics to stimulate your competitive spirit and get your blood pumping. You can even compare yourself to other volunteers to see how well you are doing. Just a little friendly competition, nothing nefarious on our end. On that note, please do your very best and try to have fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a virtual reality game where you pilot a little lander with intuitive motion controls. Enjoy over 50 levels in 5 different locations of increasingly challenging courses. Collect the coins and land without crashing to get the best times and compete on the leaderboards. We have more free content planned for the future!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T03:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/094ca988bddd3b5e9f5c4e382ab3aaa9.jpg", "website": "https://llcbrightcorners.wixsite.com/bright-corners-llc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Poop Dollar", "Bright Corners"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Bright Corners"], "esrb_rating": null}
