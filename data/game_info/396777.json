It's time you taught that damned hat wearing goon and her other hat wearing goons a lesson once and for all. Except...</p>\n<p><strong>Not Even an Alpha Bro:<br/></strong>This game was created for the 2019 Yuri Game Jam. And as life goes; laziness, sleep, friends, hangouts, not being a programmer and crying at all the null exceptions, crying some more because your animations broke because what is IK rigging lmao, list goes on really. Because of these factors I really didn't do what I set out to get done, which in hindsight was super ambitious for a first time solo project, but I told myself no matter what state the game was in I'd upload it anyway, even if it were just boxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Author Dialogue:<br/></strong>Honestly even though its not where I wanted it to be, I'm pretty happy with how far its come. I will definitely be working on this further. Gradually I will be adding the rest of the game to the game and eventually reach the point I was aiming for. I was inspired by\u00a0 the way Dark Souls and Monster Hunter: Worlds handles their combat and especially how challenging the AI could be in Dark Souls, which unsurprisingly is even more challenging to develop. For the art direction I really loved Shovel Knight and originally the concept for this game was 2D pixel art. But I really wanted to dive into some 3D modeling and animating and thus this monstrosity was born.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:51:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/2076ce2a9e6b83adee28c8817e0f43fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blazinmeow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
