After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Ancient China. The August Personage of Jade has summoned you to his Heavenly Palace to help right the balance of the world. Yin and Yang were in harmony, kept safe in an exquisite Jade vase in his Heavenly Pavilion, but one day Pan Gu, who held up the world stretched out his arms. The vase shattered, Yin and Yang poured out and the shards tumbled to Earth.<br/><br/>The mischievous Monkey King saw all this. He picked up the pieces and scattered them. He's been punished, imprisoned once more under Five Fingers Mountain. He's confessed he saw some dragons swoop down and pick up the shards. They carried them off for their treasure.<br/><br/>You and the Monkey King (via a telepathic connection) must seek out those nine pieces of the broken Jade vase and return them to the August Personage of Jade so he can repair the vase and restore Yin and Yang so the world will no longer be in chaos.<br/><br/>You'll face Spectral Monks, slithering lizards, hungry tigers and numerous poisonous dragons and demons as you journey through a lush world.<br/> <br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select \"Dragon Jade\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 21 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Dragon Jade has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65e1ac243d6d914ad84d3e8e3cc0429f.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
