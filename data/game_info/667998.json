Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game that follows these rules:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Any living cell with fewer than than two or more than three neighbors dies.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life.<br/><br/><strong>---- Notice ----</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0This simulator is for visual purposes only, NOT\u00a0for extensive calculations. Running relatively large creations may cause the software to become unstable.<br/><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0As well, this program will always default to full-screen mode. If you wish to close the application, you will need to manually close it either through task-manager or clicking \"Alt\" + \"Tab\"\u00a0and switching to your desktop, where you can right-click the application in your taskbar and click \"Close window\".<br/><br/><strong>---- How to Use\u00a0----\u00a0</strong><br/>Below is an in-depth video elaborating on how to use this software:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0As well, while it is not recommended,\u00a0you may still be interested in testing creations outside of the 501x501 limit.
