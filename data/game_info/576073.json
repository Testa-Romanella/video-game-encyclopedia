Link to\u00a0\"Jamming with GDWC - Round 1:\u00a0Broken Steel!\":\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/jamming-with-gdwc\u00a0</p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>You are but a humble, little knight who stumbled into the arena, filled to the brim with big, evil monsters and also not so big and not so evil mosnters. There <em>always\u00a0</em>has to be a slime.</p>\n<p>At your disposal are 6 different weapons, naturally, only for self-defense, each with their unique basic and special attack as well as an effect when you hit an enemy. As evil as they are, sometimes the monsters are nice enough to drop a weapon for you after you succesfully defended yourself agains them - But theres a catch: Your weapons break, leaving nothing but scrap!</p>\n<p>Luckily, the arena is also home to your best friend, the anvil, and even more conveniently, you need nothing but said scrap to craft weapons that are even stronger than before!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's only one question left:\u00a0\u00a0How long can you survive?</p>\n\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>I\u00a0would love to hear what you think! Either comment here or message me on Discord (Lophee#4625)\u00a0if you want. Don't be shy, feedback is always welcome :)</p>\nSpecial thanks\r\n<p>go to a dear friend who I\u00a0initially planned to jam with for coming up with the idea together and being a good friend, an unsuspected helper for crashing in last-minute and helping me find good sounds, and everybody who helped me test the game, find bugs and gave me feedback. I'm blessed to have good people around me.</p>\nKnown issues\r\n<p>Salvage button in crafting menu doesn't do anything. I didn't have enough time while the jam was still running, but I\u00a0will add the salvage feature when I\u00a0have some time again!\u00a0<br/></p>\nFurthermore\r\n<p>All assets in this game are either free to use, already owned by me or made by myself.
