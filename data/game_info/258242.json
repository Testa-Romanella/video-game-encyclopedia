I\u00a0prefer to iterate on art as I\u00a0block out gameplay so mood and shape language should be represented early.\u00a0The loop technically ends when the curse is lifted...this build doesn't really end.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19d/19d97017e136480d2d2db2ff0e0536c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AldenFilion"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
