Please do give feedback even if you don't like the game, it really will help!<br/>IncarnateMillions of years ago, heavenly wars ravaged earth. The Devil and God made a treaty to stay away from earth, but the devil would only accept if one in every 1,000,000,000 children born was controlled by him. At first, this seemed reasonable, but now the devil children's numbers are rising, and you are called in after dying in a car crash.
