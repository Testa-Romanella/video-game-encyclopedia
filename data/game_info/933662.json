With such a tight timeframe, I had to take a few shortcuts in order to have something playable by the end. Instead of adding more enemy variety, there's a chance that enemies will have modifiers upon spawning, such as protective shields and little orbiting enemies, and these modifiers appear more often on later waves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's how the wave spawning works:</p>\n<ul><li>The total number of enemies spawned per wave starts at 7, and increases by 2 for each wave.</li><li>First, the game determines the enemy's type<ul><li>On wave 1, only green enemies spawn.</li><li>For wave 2, blue enemies have a 1-in-5 chance to replace green ones.</li><li>For waves 3-7, blue and green enemies have equal chances to spawn.</li><li>For waves &gt;7, blue, green, and purple enemies have equal chances to spawn.</li></ul></li><li>The enemy is then given a small increase to its speed based on the wave.</li><li>For every wave after wave 6, there's an increasing chance for any enemy (excluding purple ones) to have a glass shield, which allows them to take one extra hit.<ul><li>This chance starts at 1-in-7, then increases to\u00a02-in-8, 3-in-9, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Lastly, enemies after wave 6 can have mini-enemies that orbit around them. The maximum amount\u00a0increases according to the following graph:</li></ul>\n\n<em>The maximum amount of orbiting enemies each enemy can have. The exact amount decided is randomly chosen on a scale from 0 to the max. amount.</em><br/>\n\n<p>I initially wanted there to be different types of meteors, such as ones that make a small AOE explosion on every impact, but that idea unfortunately had to be scrapped for time.</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for checking this game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T11:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eacc54e410a32b9c11c186a196727e0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sadkirbo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
