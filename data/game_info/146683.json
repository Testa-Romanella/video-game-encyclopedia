You must navigate a level while collecting medals and evading hazards. There's a twist, however: All of your enemies die in one hit! You too, however, can die in one hit as well, and since your attack range is small  you must be very careful and wait for the best moment to strike. After (and if) you manage to safely navigate the level, you must fight 4 bosses together. Will you be able to defeat them? </p><p>UPDATE: Added a new stage, \"Elevator\".</p><p>UPDATE 2: Added a new stage, \"Space\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/2323a30a17ee263fee3c15a042591ab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["demian742"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
