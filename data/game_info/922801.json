In order to pay for an operation that will turn them back into a normal cat, they need to collect the diamonds that fall from the sky, BUT! if Weaver collects a rocket-- a nuke-- then the condition begins to revert back and it costs more to get the operation, this effectively lowers the amount of diamonds that the cat has! In order to move Weaver, move the mouse to the left and right! In order to show how badly Weaver has been transformed the sprite is a cat face on top of a basket body.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T09:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6ebcaacf3abf07d3f8ce35abd11a25f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CadenM7"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
