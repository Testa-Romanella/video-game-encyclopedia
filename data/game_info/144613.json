With rent piling higher, and nothing fueling him but an old obsession for pulp mystery novels, Bastion posts an advertisement on a local BBS on a lark. To his surprise, he gets a client...but can Bastion really make it as a private eye, or will it take more than his detective novels can teach him?</p><p><strong>Chatbox Shamus</strong> is an ongoing mystery-themed visual novel project by Corwin Brence. It was originally planned to be 5 cases long and funded by Kickstarter, but well, we know how those things tend to work out for nobodies. What I'm offering to download here is the original Case 1 pitch that was available through the Kickstarter campaign page. The case is technically complete, and showcases some features that I'd be using more extensively in a more finished game. It does not have finished graphics (mostly my own photographs and placeholder character sprites) or very much sound at all. In fact, it doesn't really resemble anything close to a finished product at all,\u00a0but I'm posting it here for the sake of posterity while the project gets a serious reworking and replanning in the background.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c06e2fddbd941d63f08faea5222b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corwin B."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
