This fictional world was once used as home to many civilizations. It has been torn by war and Titans, immortal gigantic creatures that fight for world domination. The game tells the story of a few survivors that try to rebuild their lives in a completely new world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The add-on does not change the base game&#39;s gameplay much. The game is nonlinear, featuring sandbox gameplay. While not participating in campaign quests, the players are free to interact with other factions either waging war upon them or making new allies. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses whether to create a new sovereign or play as a pre-set one. </p>\n<p>While building up their kingdom, the players have to keep an eye out on their resources, technology research, and development of their own sovereign using magic spells. </p>\n<h3>Legendary Heroes features</h3>\n<p>The add-on adds two new factions; a fame system, that now allows the champions to spawn based on your amount of fame; a revamped character leveling system; new huge maps; several new monsters; refined graphics engine and UI; several new quest branches and items with them.</p>\n<p>All these changes do not drastically affect the gameplay, yet the add-on&#39;s features are a welcome addition to the game. It was given free of charge to the players that pre-ordered the game.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2013-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T04:30:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8f5ee9d6c5322f4f9901397a8846d7a.jpg", "website": "http://www.elementalgame.com/", "rating": 3.19, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 53, "owned": 935, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 18, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 55, "ratings_count": 35, "suggestions_count": 639, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stardock Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
