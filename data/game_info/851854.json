They are promised that four of them will be handed the means to achieve their ambitions, but on one condition: that they prove themselves to be more dedicated than anyone else.<br/></p>\n<p>And there are many, many ways to prove one's commitment to their cause.<br/></p>\n<p>~\r\n</p>\n<p>12 Tenets is a psychological horror visual novel about fanaticism and the heinous acts people will commit for the sake of their beliefs - a lot of things become morally acceptable when one is convinced that their goals are just. <br/></p>\n<p>The story is viewed through the eyes of Laurent Girardot, a man as altruistic as he is empathetic and capable of discerning what goes on through others' minds. Singularily focused on helping as many people as possible regardless on the toll of himself,\u00a0 he is determined to win the conference, yet fairly and without harming anyone else - hopefully, he'll be able to cling to these ideals as the event unfolds.<br/></p>\n<p>Writing, Art, Development and Soundtrack by subterfuge_rena\r\n</p>\n<p>Misc sound effects taken from Zapsplat and Pixabay\r\n</p>\n<p>Plugins used credits: Yanfly, SRDude, LunaTechs,\u00a0 Fallen Angel Olivia, PKD, Jatopian, Tor Damian Design, Mr. Trivel, Moghunter, Himeworks\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my good friend Wren for beta reading the script! <br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Moderate gore and violence\r\n</li><li>Death\r\n</li><li>Suicide\r\n</li><li>Fascism\r\n</li><li>Self-destructive behaviour/thoughts</li><li>A brief scene involving transphobia + a homophobic slur being used\r\n</li><li>Mild flashing + static occasionally taking up the screen\r\n</li><li>A brief pseudo-jumpscare\r\n</li><li>Swearing\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>12T has been in development for a little under two years.
