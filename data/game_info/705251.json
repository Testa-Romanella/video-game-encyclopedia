Run on a NPC to kill him.</p>Trijam\r\n<p>This game was made for the Trijam #148. The theme was\u00a0<strong>Inconvenient super powers</strong>.It was my very first game jam and I loved the experience. There was a 3 hour limit to play games but I went over and it took me a little over 4 hours to make. Even though I failed to make a game within the time limit, I wanted to share what I had done.</p>\r\nIdea\r\n<p>The idea for this game was to have a superhero who doesn't control his super speed. So I did Flash in a cafe that accidentally kills innocent people with its super speed. Policemen then arrive to stop Flash but avoiding the bullets he will kill others policeman.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>I used the Tiny Bundle\u00a0pack made by Vryell. All the visuals were taken in this pack. No art were made during the game jam. Go take a look at\u00a0Vryell's work it's amazing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:51:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ee/7ee207d5132f671d932b5aa94f2c5887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LouShunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
