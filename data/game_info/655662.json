(There's 10.)</p>\n<p>- AN EPIC STORY told in pieces, written by a college dropout! And you can really tell!</p>\n<p>- A SCALING DIFFICULTY that adds MORE ENEMY VARIETIES as you PROGRESS THROUGH THE GAME!<br/></p>\n<p>- Retro pixel art made by REAL HUMAN BEINGS!<br/></p>\n<p>- A constantly-shifting soundscape, mixed and produced by someone who's BETTER AT THIS THAN US!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- FAR LESS humor than is in this description!
