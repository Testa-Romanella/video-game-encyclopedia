Explore trap-filled dungeons and face mighty bosses. Collect piles of treasure and items and invest in dozens of abilities and unlockable equipment. Test your skills against the oncoming darkness.<br/><br/>Pocket RPG is a dual-stick action dungeon-crawler. In it you can choose from three distinct classes, each with their own combat style.<br/><br/>The Dark Ranger uses his bow and arrows to assault enemies from a distance. The Blade Master gets up close and personal with a powerful arsenal of melee weapons. The Battle Mage uses her powerful spells to deal damage to the enemies and attack their weak points. You'll accompany one of these warriors on their journey to bring peace to the land by clearing out areas of monsters, one quest at a time. <br/><br/>Each time you finish a quest, the levels you've gained and the equipment you've gathered will be converted into resources you can use to upgrade your character, expanding their abilities and strengthening their powers. You'll need all the help you can get. The dungeons, sewers, forests, and other environments you'll explore may have a lot of treasure to find, but they're also packed with huge crowds of vicious fiends. Use everything you have at your disposal to dispatch these wicked threats and ensure the forces of good are victorious.<br/><br/>Pick from the agile Dark Ranger, the stalwart Blade Master, or the crafty Battle Mage.
