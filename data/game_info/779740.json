It was developed for the Atari 8-bit family and widely ported to other systems.</h2>\n<p>As Bounty Bob, the player&#39;s goal is to inspect every section of each mine in search of the evil Yukon Yohan while avoiding the radioactive creatures that inhabit the mine. As Bounty Bob walks over a section of flooring, it fills with color. To complete the level, every section of flooring must be colored. There are ten mines in total (eleven in the ColecoVision port). Each level is timed and must be completed before the player runs out of oxygen.</p>\n<p>Objects in each mine aid and hinder Bob&#39;s progress. Ladders allow him to climb up or down to the next platform, chutes slide Bob off a platform (often against his will), and pulverizers crush Bob if he gets in their way. Some items, if picked up, can also garner the player extra points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T22:06:24", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Atari 5200"], "developers": ["Eastridge Technology", "Big Five Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Big Five Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
