The ray shielding on your station has failed, leading to key components of your ship breaking down. Luckily your suit should protect you from the worst of the radiation. It also has a limited supply of 02 to sustain you until help arrives, but you can't say the same about the station itself. It will take some time for your SOS message to reach anyone, and even longer still for them to respond. Until then you must use all the skills at your disposal to keep the station up and running, repairing any issues until help arrives.</p>\n\n<p>this game was made as part of the 2020 Falmouth game jam.</p><p>made as group in 48hours</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f99006f6671dd629d89cb4804584cf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zavy9t9@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
