Each maze is timed, so you can keep notes and try to beat your previous time.</p>\n<p>The game uses only the colours <strong>Black</strong>, <strong>White</strong>, <strong>Dark Grey</strong>, <strong>Red </strong>and <strong>Green</strong>. I chose these colours at random, then worked them into the game as I developed it.\u00a0 I decided to make a puzzle/maze game because I wanted to keep my first submission simple, as I am also still learning in college.</p>\n<p>I have created a Google form for feedback:\u00a0https://forms.gle/FXHWgpF2YAFN9aT87</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and hopefully, you decide to give it a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d58/d58ffcb532771db877a0b90dd31dfe4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bodin_buster"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
