But you will create a purpose, and that purpose is to do the unthinkable. The extraordinary. The tasks that few have thought to achieve. The world you struggle in pushes back with tremendously nonsensical squares and launchers... coins that pay for things you would only imagine should have been free to begin with. Spikes will be hellbent in causing your demise. This will not be easy. And while the road of purposelessness will be overbearing you will succeed. You know why?</p>\n<p>Because it&#39;s your destiny.</p>\n<p>Welcome to metagaming hell.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Achievement Unlocked 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T00:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09795dee593fc3b5f0d4ed4de6e39ac.jpg", "website": "http://www.jmtb02.com/achievement-unlocked-2", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Cooney"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Armor Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
