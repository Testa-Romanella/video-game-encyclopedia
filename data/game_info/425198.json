You can choose to pass the information on, by pressing the appropriate key, or let the commuters\u00a0pass by. You can see yourself walking on the streets of Harmonia on the right hand side.\u00a0The more people you influence, the more positive changes you can see in the world around you. Similarly, the more people you don't influence, the more under-developed the town becomes. If you lose all influence, the town will eventually turn to rubble. This shows how much of an impact togetherness and solidarity can have globally and what can happen without it!</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>You can press the respective keys <strong>(W, A, S, D)</strong>\u00a0to \"catch\" the people as they pass by the information booths. Keep increasing your score and you will see more improvements to the town of Harmonia. Keep losing people, and the town of Harmonia will be no more!</p>\n<p>Every few people influenced will trigger a positive development in the moving world on the right.\u00a0If you successfully\u00a0influence 10 people in a row, a boost will become available which can be activated with <strong>SPACE </strong>and will trigger an additional positive development in Harmonia.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All sprites and code files in the game were designed and developed entirely by me within the time frame of the jam.</p>\n<p>The music for this game was downloaded from the\u00a0Open Game Art website.
