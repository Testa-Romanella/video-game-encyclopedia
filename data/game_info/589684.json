Fortunately for you, a mysterious entity decided to give you a second chance at life to allow you to finish your search, but at a cost: to end the pain of those who are suffering. Dark forces invaded your old world, and now, thanks to your new powers, you can see what lies beneath the wickedness of mortals. Perhaps, this has always been the path you were supposed to take just to be able to see her one more time...<br/></p>\n<p>\"Death &amp; Judgement\" is a Boss-Rush-Bullet-Hell game where you have to perform either Critical Hits or Perfect Dodges in order to power up and be able to use the Tactical Mode, which allows you to select powerful abilities to unleash against the enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Mechanics</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Special Moves:</strong> Hit the enemy's back with your gun to perform a Critical Hit and evade the enemy's attacks at the last minute to execute a Perfect Dodge. Perform your Special Moves to fill the Tactical Mode Timer and to obtain points for the\u00a0Ability Bar.\r\n</li><li><strong>Unleash your True Power:</strong> Performing a Perfect Dodge will also provide you a Token (up to three) that you can spend\u00a0to increase the Power Level of your abilities during the Tactical Mode.\r\n</li><li><strong>Stop the Time, Stop to Breath:</strong> Make good use of the Tactical Mode! When you pause the game you can spend your Ability Points to select between four different Abilities (each ability has a different range and damage value).\u00a0You can also choose which part of the enemy you want to Hit. But be aware, you cannot stay more than 10 seconds in this mode.</li><li><strong>Think Right:</strong> For every part missed, the enemy\u2019s moveset will change, perhaps at your advantage, but his power will increase too.</li></ul>\n<p>For more information about the Core Mechanics, you can consult the Tutorial.</p>\n<p>The game was made for 7 days as a submission to the Bullet Hell Jam 2021.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Normal Mode:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>W: Move Forward\r\n</li><li>S: Move Back\r\n</li><li>A: Move Left\r\n</li><li>D: Move Right\r\n</li><li>Mouse: Rotation and Aim\r\n</li><li>Click SX Mouse: Shoot\r\n</li><li>Shift: Call Tactical Mode\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Tactical Mode:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mouse: Navigation\r\n</li><li>Click SX Mouse:\r\n<ul><li>Select Player\u2019s Ability\r\n</li><li>Select Enemy\u2019s Parts\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Space Bar: Undo Selection\r\n</li><li>Shift: Exit Tactical Mode\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong></p>\n<p>Programmer - Roby65\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist - CalicoJack96\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Game Designer - Migheloz</p>\n<p><strong>Custom made assets during the jam</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>All code\u00a0\r\n</li><li>2D Art and UI\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Assets from Third Party:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/427594/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/NoiseCollector/sounds/6173/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/kermite607/sounds/368203/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/523091/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/miksmusic/sounds/497713/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/FilmmakersManual/sounds/522505/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/alukahn/sounds/171234/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/ctowns68/sounds/529226/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Robinhood76/sounds/91294/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Hoggington/sounds/536719/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Nox_Sound/sounds/554907/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Johnny2810/sounds/559531/\r\n</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/Ev-Dawg/sounds/335991/\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Font:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Carnivalee Freakshow Font | dafont.com\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T06:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/072/072ab5e5c9ef7eb88b4a267c64127bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Roby65", "Migheloz", "CalicoJack96"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
