The story text is about 5,000 words, with branch options but the first half is a linear narrative, advancing the story around the background of the characters. There are four endings at the end, and players can easily go back and read other endings.</p>\n<p>###</p>\n\n<p>###</p>\r\nCitations and Statements\r\n\n<p><strong><em>This project is for coursework purposes only and is not intended for any commercial use.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Thanks to Luke Cooke-Swords for the inspiration I made.</p>\n<p>https://lukecookeyarborough.itch.io/swords</p>\n<p>The 8bit pixel image of the cover is quoted from the Internet, but the original author cannot be verified.
