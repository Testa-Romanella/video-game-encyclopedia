You will be invisible to each other except for the pulses of light\u00a0you can use to light your way\u00a0through the labyrinth. You will find that some walls are fake replica's and will disappear when walking up to them. The fake walls are unique to each player so you will have to stick together and follow each others lights to find the true path.</p>\n<p>Even though the game is very dark and slightly ominous, this is not a horror game so you don't have to worry about any jump scares.</p>\n<p>The game uses Photon Unity Networking on a free plan so the number of concurrent players is unfortunately limited right now.</p>\n<p>This project was made as part of\u00a0the DevSquad Academy Jam of 2020:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/devsquad-2020.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Carolien Gilbers</p>\n<p>Roelof Jansen<br/></p>\n<p>David Mijdam</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Scheidelaar</p>\n<p>Lucas Walters</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T07:13:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74cd99b54912c1fdb26d648fe4ff9eae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["LucasWalters"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
