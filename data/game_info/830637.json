I spent several weeks writing the script and designing the levels, hoping that the game process would be interesting and engage the players and also cooperate with the progress of the plot. The biggest problem I encountered during the production process was how to combine narrative and puzzle-solving level interaction. I hope I can like the game I make.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0f3da28da2783ca530cadfa7bb11c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YCMElSTER"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
