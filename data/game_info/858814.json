You can increase your time by finding clocks laying on the ground around the map, walking over a clock will give you an additional 20 seconds of time.</p>\n<p>The first level is not so dark so your headlamp should do the trick but you do have a flashlight and the levels do get darker. To toggle on/off the flashlight you can click \"R\". Once the timer for the flashlight battery runs out then you can no longer turn the flashlight on.</p>\n<p>As well as being able to find clocks around the map you can find futuristic batteries as well! They provide the same functionality as the clocks, when you step over it to collect it, you will gain an additional 5 seconds of power.</p>\n\n<p>To play the game:</p>\n<p>FOR WINDOWS:</p>\n<p>Download the zip files and extract them to one location.
