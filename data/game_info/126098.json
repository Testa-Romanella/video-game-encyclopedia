Theseus returns to slay the out of control minotaur population, but instead of a sword he's using a race car. Unfortunately, the minotaur has enlisted gorillas to help him, but Theseus loves gorillas and can't bear to harm a single one. Plus they're endangered species, and even a Greek god is not above the law. Your objective as Theseus is to crush the minotaur while avoiding all gorillas. If Theseus hits a gorilla, the grief overwhelms him and he vanishes to another realm.</p><p>Instructions: Run over minotaurs, avoid gorillas.</p><p>Controls: Use arrow keys to steer &lt;- left, ^ forward, v backward, -&gt; right</p><p>The following Unity Assets were used in the project:</p><p>- Standard Assets Environment, Vehicles, Characters, Utility</p><p>- Nature Starter Kit 2</p><p>- Gorilla</p><p>- Minotaur</p><p>- SkyB1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/3441e1ba11d81ed82f04fab5be1c32d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["returnoftheturk"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
