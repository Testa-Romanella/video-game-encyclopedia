That's much of the story already; but wait, there's more! You find yourself in a vast, absolutely black, dark dungeon, of infinite dimensions, carrying only a flashlight to illuminate your way, and you are tasked with finding eight, variously colored gems. Find them all, before The Beast gets you, and you win. It's a walk in the park, except that it's dark! Play it now in your browser. On a console computer, use arrow keys to move, mouse to point flashlight. On mobile use touch.</p>\n<p>Visit\u00a0Zorbalunk.com for more mobile-ready games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe0ee9e5dff98b213a1294614a9507a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["horan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
