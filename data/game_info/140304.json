Solve the mystery....discover yourself.\r\nNow at a new low price!\r\n\n<p><strong><em>\"You awaken in a strange place, empty of any noticeably intelligent life. Surrounded by zombie robots, aimless and chaotic. \u00a0The world around you seems to be an endless sea of islands floating in a void. \u00a0Fight your way through the unique procedurally generated levels, collect valuable artifacts and try to find a way to that distant city in hopes of finding a way out of the chaos.\" \u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>\"Verzaken!\"</strong>\u00a0</em>is the first full game from indie game development company,<strong>\u00a0<em>interFusion Games</em>.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0The game takes advantage of\u00a0<strong>procedural generation</strong>\u00a0of levels, enemies and weapons, making each playthrough a truly unique experience. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \"Lone Wanderer\" contains\u00a0<strong>100+ graphical variations of each type of weapon and enemies</strong>. We have 10+ weapon types planned, and may end up with many more.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>OVER 1000 DIFFERENT WEAPONS!\u00a0</strong>On top of that, each weapon has random stats- leading to an infinite variety of weapons to choose from-\u00a0<strong><em>including hard to find secret weapons.\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>As you enter each \"void island\", you will be forced to use your handy pick-axe to dig through the\u00a0<strong>rubble of an ancient yet advanced civilization</strong>\u00a0to find new and better weapons\u00a0<strong>as\u00a0</strong>you advance through hordes of enemies that get increasingly insane and violent...
