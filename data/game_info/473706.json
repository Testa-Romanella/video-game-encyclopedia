Legends tell that this comet contains the essences of life itself, and is the very reason why we exist today. On one fateful day, a section of the comet broke off and entered our planets atmosphere, fracturing into 5 individual shards and spreading out across the planets surface before being found.</p>\n<p>The discovered shards were given names related to the aspects of life that each appeared to affect.</p>\n<p>- Chaos: The disorder of life.<br/>- Erasure: The absence of life.<br/>- Chronos: The present, past, and future.<br/>- Harmony: The balance between all things.<br/>- Vigor:\u00a0 The strength of the body and mind.<br/></p>\n<p>Ravenstorm plays out the\u00a0struggle brought by the shards and the rifts created between the clans that found them. We begin with the Pride, a clan of honorable lion-like warriors being invaded by the the Flock, a clan of raven and crows intent on wiping out every last member of the Pride.</p>\r\nPremise\r\n<p>Ravenstorm is a tactics card game where players strategically place cards to gain control over the game board. Each player begins with a 30-card deck, drawing a 5-card hand, and take turns placing their cards on a 4x4 grid. The 4 edges and 4 corners of the cards played are generated at the beginning of a run and assigned offensive or defensive stats. When placed, cards deal or mitigate damage based on their edges, and the edges of cards located next to them. Reducing a card's health to 0, or attacking an existing card of 0 health flips the cards affiliation, increasing the attacking player's control of the game board.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Cards placed with an offensive edge will attack a previously played card, located next to the offensive edge. Damage dealt to a card reduces the receiving card's health. Should the receiving card's health drop to 0, it's affiliation is flipped to the opposing card's affiliation allowing the attacker to 'gain control' over that card, increasing that player's board control.</p>\n<p>Received damage can be mitigated if a receiving card has a defensive edge. Damage dealt to a card reduces the receiving card's armor. Should the receiving card's armor be reduced to 0, and unmitigated damage is reduced from the receiving card's health.</p>\n<p>Flipping a card's affiliation will cause a cascade, causing flipped card's to attack adjacent cards should their offensive edge be adjacent to an opposing card.</p>\n<p>The round ends when each player has placed all of the cards from their hand. A player wins should the round end with the most controlled cards under his or her control. Winning allows the player to choose one of the opponent's controlled cards to keep. Should the winner end the round with all cards under their control, the winner keeps all cards.</p>\n<p>Should a tie unfold, a new hand is drawn and a new round is played. Should a match exceed 6 rounds, all previously played cards are reshuffled into a full deck, a new hand is drawn and a new round is played.</p>\n<p>Play continues until the player looses, or the player eliminates all opponents.</p>\n<p>Upon winning a match, the opponents essence is then lost from the physical plane as the opposing shard is absorbed into the player's shard.</p>\n<p>Loosing a match causes the player to die, removing their essence from the physical plane as it is absorbed into the opponents shard</p>\n<p><strong>Release Notes</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a00.0.4</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0Added quit button for PoC demo.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Pressing the escape key now quits the game.</p>\n<p>-\u00a00.0.3</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Hidden\u00a0card\u00a0stats\u00a0on\u00a0cards\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0Ai\u00a0PlayerHand.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Cards\u00a0within\u00a0an\u00a0Ai\u00a0PlayerHand\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0dragged\u00a0or\u00a0played\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0human\u00a0player.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Background\u00a0for\u00a0PlayerHand\u00a0cards.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Breaking\u00a0the\u00a0armor\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0opposing\u00a0card\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0dealing\u00a0any\u00a0excess\u00a0damage\u00a0to\u00a0health\u00a0no\u00a0longer\u00a0captures\u00a0the\u00a0attacked\u00a0card.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Increased\u00a0round\u00a0delay;\u00a0the\u00a0time\u00a0delay\u00a0between\u00a0playing\u00a0the\u00a0final\u00a0card\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0round\u00a0and\u00a0starting\u00a0a\u00a0new\u00a0round.</p>\n<p>-\u00a00.0.2</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Implementation\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0Ai\u00a0player\u00a0that\u00a0randomly\u00a0selects\u00a0a\u00a0tile\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0gameboard\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0card\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0PlayerHand\u00a0to\u00a0play\u00a0on\u00a0its\u00a0turn.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0New\u00a0gameboard\u00a0model.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0New\u00a0card\u00a0model.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Implementation\u00a0for\u00a0randomly\u00a0blocking\u00a00-5\u00a0Gameboard\u00a0tiles\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0start\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0round.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a00.0.1</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Interatable\u00a0PlayerHands\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0and\u00a0second\u00a0player.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Interactable\u00a0Gameboard\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0player\u00a0to\u00a0place\u00a0cards\u00a0from\u00a0their\u00a0PlayerHand.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Implementation\u00a0for\u00a0attacking\u00a0cards\u00a0and\u00a0defending\u00a0damage.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Implementation\u00a0for\u00a0'capturing'\u00a0an\u00a0opposing\u00a0card.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edge Guide</strong></p>\n<p>Yellow - Attack</p>\n<p>Grey - Defense</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tile Guide</strong></p>\n<p>Green - Available<br/></p>\n<p>Black - Blocked</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/6937381e2f549e5675640fb18f51afdb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Over One Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
