Seeming wise at first glance, he has cat paws and an inability to behave like an adult. And you were chosen as the fixer of the problems caused by the awkward god!<br/></p>\r\nKey features:\r\n<ul><li>Wreak havoc with destructible environment physics \u2014 destroy anything from buildings to moving objects.<br/>\n</li><li>Stretch bombs to change their blast power, pull the fuse to adjust the explosion delay and toss them in any direction (blowing yourself up is harmless here, but don\u2019t try this at home!)<br/>\n</li><li>Choose your way of moving around in VR \u2014 teleport or smooth motion (using sticks), climb up to higher spots, and enjoy the spectacular vista of collapsing structures! Game locations are planned with a flat landscape in mind, so this should also cause less sickness.<br/>\n</li><li>Explore the surreal and cartoonish sandbox worlds. Find out what happened to you and why the only thing you\u2019re bound to do is to destroy everything and everywhere.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T10:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d00492528002ee2911dcfffe66cd96ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 361, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["creativemobile"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
