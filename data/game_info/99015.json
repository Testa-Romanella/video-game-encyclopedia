The idea it self is pretty simple, you have to clear a stock of fruits by combining them. But each combination summons ghosts and this is the part where the game gets tricky. But a friend can help you with that part! She or he just need an android device with and game extending app (which is also a part of the zip file). Together the game become easier but also funnier.</p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p>But better than an explanation is always to try it out by your self ;)</p><p>The music was made by the awesome guy Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>\"Mischief Maker\" &amp; \"Fluffing a Duck\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd124758882eec84ce603162ed9a9177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Waldemar Umaniz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
