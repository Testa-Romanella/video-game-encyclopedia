He comes by for their regular English lesson obe day, and finds her gone. The other\u00a0player would access a range of\u00a0 relatives;\u00a0her husband, her step-sister, her house-maid. These characters each open up different time-period and details into Frieda's life and space, from early\u00a0 to later adulthood, between 1920s and 1960s.\u00a0The game involves players going back and forth\u00a0sifting through layers\u00a0of both audio and visuals in a collaborative manner to reconstruct the mysteries of an absent woman. One player will use headphones to listen through sounds, music and rumors, and guide the other through the visual space towards different\u00a0objects in the room and thus, learn more about their history and their present.</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>SOUNDSCAPE\u00a0EXPLORATION </strong><em>(see audiotracks in zip folder):</em></p>\n<p><strong>Audiotrack 1: (1920s) <br/>M</strong><strong>arriage years. First seen from the perspective of Dunya, the stepsister, with some hints to Lakshmi's village.</strong></p>\n<p>In upper class Bombay,\u00a0Frieda and Nariman have recently gotten married. He's surprised that she is not joyful at their wedding. His sister Dunya talks about this.</p>\n<p>The week of the March festival, Nariman goes to the temple for solace.<br/>That is the first time Frieda happens to meet Lakshmi, the wife and replacement of their usual\u00a0as \"Dabbawalla\" a delivery person,\u00a0collecting Nariman's food box that day. Later in the same season, Frieda goes to a temple on her own and\u00a0catches a glimpse of Lakshmi there, for the second time. She speaks to her, and learns which village she is from.\u00a0Frieda keeps a token from that day at the temple, a Ganesha bell at her altar, a symbol new beginnings, that becomes part of the audio hint system in later scenes. S<em>ounds at the end of this audio,\u00a0 a mule train with bells segment, are references to Lakshmi's village.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Audiotrack 2: (1940s) <br/>Exploring Frieda's room from the perspective of her husband Nariman. His business and his marriage are falling apart, but he still has hopes.</strong></p>\n<p>We hear the cityscape, an excerpt from Nariman's thoughts. Frieda and he have disagreements about many things, one of which is the state of the country (he wants the British to stay, she wants them to leave) and at this time she starts going to rallies, spinning the charkha, spending more time in her room, Going to the temple. He decides to take her to the races for a distraction.<br/><strong>Audio hint system:</strong>\u00a0<em>The sound of the horse-beats is placed in the middle of the loom sound, and the temple sound, showing an example of the hint system which, would have been introduced, first with the temple bell sound, previously, as a symbol, when the player picks it up, of something important. In this scene the loom sound gets added as a part of the hint system. When players find the horse derby stub, it carries them to the next mini-scene, the race track.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Audiotrack 3: (1940s)<br/>Race course and the beach - beginning of a more obvious separation</strong></p>\n<p>This is the last time Nariman and Frieda go to the races together. <br/>Dunya believes the marital problems are related to Nariman's business problems.\u00a0<br/>Frieda will tell\u00a0 him that day at the races, that they should not share a bedroom anymore. She orders a bed and moves into her study.<br/>She starts thinking about the beach, and the village again.</p>\n\n<p>_____________________________________________</p>\n<p><strong>This project is meant as a love letter to nostalgia, dusty places that are left behind,\u00a0 and the human intimacy revolving around relationships on the edge of\u00a0societal boundaries.
