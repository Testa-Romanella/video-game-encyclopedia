To carry out the research you must feed the animals with what you find around so that it reproduces, generate as many animals as possible and you will be greatly rewarded with SCORE, be careful of the night because it corrupts the animals and in this state you could hurt yourself or lose animals at sunrise because of their new form, fortunately there are these large luminous orbs which seem to be able to purify them, they only need a good big shock to get themselves activate !</p>\n<strong>[\u2328\ufe0f] Keyboard controls</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0- Move</li>\n<li><strong>SPACE</strong>\u00a0- Jump &amp; Confirm</li>\n<li><strong>SHIFT</strong>\u00a0- Dash</li>\n<li><strong>F2</strong>\u00a0- Secret Setting</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>[\ud83c\udfae] Gamepad controls</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DPAD</strong>\u00a0- Move</li>\n<li><strong>(A)</strong>\u00a0- Jump &amp; Confirm</li>\n<li><strong>(B)</strong>\u00a0- Dash</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>[\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f] How To Score</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>During the day collect as much food as possible and try to feed each animal once.
