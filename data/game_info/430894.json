You control the main character with either the arrow keys or A/D. You can pause the game pressing space. The game will end once you find the 20 birds.</p>\n<p>The game should activate fullscreen after the intro, I recommend playing it on fullscreen. You can also activate fullscreen using the icon on the right bottom corner (on the browser version) or pressing F on the desktop version.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nMisc.-\r\n<p>This game is harder than the ones I usually make. Took me 4 minutes and 10 deaths to complete the last build before releasing it, then again, I had been practising for two days. Once you get to the end the game will show how many times you have died.<br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c0/6c0f8a1b67d041672b98553dcd79c5ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
