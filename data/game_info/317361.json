He\u2019s all about finding treasure, the buried kind. And no, he\u2019s not a pirate. Nonetheless, Daryl, armed with just the shovel he found in his backyard shed, likes to head to the park to find as many lost valuables as he can.<br/></p>\n<p>Of course, Daryl didn\u2019t get nicknamed \u201cFetch\u201d for no reason. He has a near paranormal skill for knowing where to dig. He\u2019s been honing his skills since he was a young boy, and now he knows if he\u2019s standing near a buried cache or not. </p>\n<p>The one skill he doesn\u2019t have, though, is knowing whether the items he\u2019s detected are valuable or not. Sometimes Daryl digs up miscellaneous and pretty useless items. But today feels lucky. </p>\n<p>How many pieces of buried treasure will he uncover today? </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0edc05841e1cf6bd8c234cb8fe69cf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Juliette Amorati"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
