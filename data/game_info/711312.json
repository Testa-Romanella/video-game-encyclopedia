I also like Warioware games and decided to make a (short) minigame compilation for you.\u00a0\r\nI took inspiration from your own game \"Spookware - At the Hospital\" and \u00a0wanted to challenge myself to make something as fun and goofy!\r\n\u00a0It kicked my butt, lol. But I hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n- Heiden\r\n\n\n\n<p>This is a minigame compilation that I made for Spacespy (go check their work out!) as part of the\u00a0Secret Santa 2021 jam! I learned so much from making this game and am super excited to use what I\u00a0learned in future games~! :D\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope 2021 treated you kindly (at the very least, we made it this far!!;;) and excited to keep making things in the upcoming year. See you then! &lt;3</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits -\r\n<ul><li>SFX by\u00a0Zapsplat</li><li>Keyboard icon by Darius Dan</li><li>Literally everything else -\u00a0It was me, Heiden! &gt;:Dc</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:56:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/3712ac5c6820dd009d47fd8e79a4827c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Heiden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
