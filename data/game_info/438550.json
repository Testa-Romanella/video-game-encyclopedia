{"id": 438550, "slug": "sprint-3-matt23x2", "name": "Sprint 3 (matt23x2)", "name_original": "Sprint 3 (matt23x2)", "description": "<p>This game builds off of sprints one and two by adding primitives which spawn an array of 3D objects as opposed to a singular object, as well as by incorporating a series of rotation, scale, and position animations for all of the the multiple object primitives.\u00a0 The speed at which the animations are happening can be controlled via an added slider bar to further change how the future and existing primitives will behave. The build additionally contains a toggle button for randomizing the animation speed as well as the three animation types described above. As many of the features which do work, the toggle destroy button is still only good for one use, and the multiple sphere primitives will not change via the size slider as the other two will. Besides this all multiple object primitives can be adjusted by all sliders presented in the GUI. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32be63ab5bf34332e5176424785fe666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matt23x2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
