However, the actual winning strategy for 11\u00d711 Hex is still unknown.</p>\n<p>In 11\u00d711 Hex, there are approximately 2.4e56 legal positions - about 5 billion times more than in chess!</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>1. Players take turns flipping the hexagonal cells to become their colour.</p>\n<p>2. The first player to form a connected path linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colour wins.</p>\n<p>3. The four corner hexagons belong to both adjacent sides.</p>\n<p>4. Swap rule: after the first move, the second player may decide to play as the first player from then on.</p>\n<p>5. If you can think of a strong response to your own move then look for a better one!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d60a405589021a7c8c69d2536efcfbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dolphingarlic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
