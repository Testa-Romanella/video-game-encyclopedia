You start with a keyboard, and some grids with symbols on. Typing in the correct 'words' will get the grid to the correct state.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each level presents you with a grid with various symbols with it - you start out with just a 'lightning bolt' and a 'moon'. These symbols tell you something about the colors you have to get the grid to. What exactly do they tell you? Well, it's your job to figure out!<br/><br/>Each letter contributes to a word which changes the colours on the grid in a certain way - another puzzle for you to solve. Once you have figured out the meaning behind the letters and symbols, you can solve the tricky puzzles Dodo throws at you.<br/><br/>Solve harder puzzles as you explore your way through the world of Dodo!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:56:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/113/113e6cba3fe47032e8b41ec4614c8c13.jpg", "website": "https://threebyfour.github.io/dodo/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ThreeByFour Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["ThreeByFour Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
