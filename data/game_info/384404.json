You'll get your own drone out, duct-tape a stun gun to the top of it and take out those rogue drones!</p>\n<p>Dodge planes, helicopters, the air traffic control tower and home in on the invading drones one by one \u2013 and destroy them. \r\nWhen you complete that task maybe you'll make headlines in the local newspaper!\r\n</p>\r\nHistory\r\n<p>\r\nSuggested during a 2018 Christmas party - the game idea stems from the TV and newspaper coverage of the shutdowns at UK airports over the busy festive period.
