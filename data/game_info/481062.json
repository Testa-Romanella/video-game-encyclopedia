Although it can serve as a interesting edutainment concept, I think it is quite difficult to communicate the various concepts of thermodynamics like heat capacity, thermal conductivity, blackbody radiation, convection, etc, through pure gameplay.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Eh, whatever, not all prototypes can be promising. Of course, this game is quite bad, but that is par for the course for a rushed game jam entry made from scratch (total dev time is about 19 hours, that is crazy short!).</em></p>\n<p><em>The submission is fairly early because of real life happenings, and I can't dedicate a Monday morning to this game jam. I don't know why I did this game jam, even though I promised myself not to rush into one with a blank Unity project, lol.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdb/fdbb5aa9d1c3d939dc056a6d51bced2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheCakeConsortium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
