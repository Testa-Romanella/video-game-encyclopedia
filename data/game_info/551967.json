Use the numbers: 1, 2, and 3 at the top of the keyboard to change between three different colours. If you are the same colour as the ball that hits you, you will gain a point and get a little smaller. If that isn't the case when the ball hits you, you will not gain any points and will increase in size. If you get the the end of stage three in growth, you lose. Once you have reached a new stage, you cannot go back to the previous stage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How This Ties to the Theme (Less is More):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The 'less' part is in the idea that you want to stay small and not grow. The 'more' part is in the idea that you will gain points while trying to stay small.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/335c0f9bdbe1690bab997dfa2009305d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["George Cranton"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
