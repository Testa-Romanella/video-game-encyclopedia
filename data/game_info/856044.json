{"id": 856044, "slug": "codename-conduit", "name": "CODENAME: CONDUIT", "name_original": "CODENAME: CONDUIT", "description": "<p><strong>CODENAME CONDUIT</strong> is a <strong>1D attrition based turn-based tactics rogue-like</strong> where you can <strong>absorb the energy of your enemies</strong> and <strong>conduct/BOUNCE it through your teammates</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Created for ScoreSpaceJam #21 2022</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game does NOT have a leaderboard</strong>. Unfortunately I didn't make it far enough to properly implement one.<br/>This game is ONLY\u00a0 a prototype and I have plans to improve it in the future.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial</strong></p>\n<p>- Click and drag unit to see which abilities can be cast, shown by colored tiles. <br/>- Hold and release on a colored tiles to use that ability. <br/>- Notice that when unit attacks, a percentage of the amount dealt BOUNCES to their connected unit = attacker OUT + connected unit IN. <br/>- I didn't have enough time to display what the abilities 'do'. Red = attack, blue = move, green = support. Sniper has a 'stim-pack' support which gives them move Power stat, which will <br/>1) Increase energy gained.<br/>2) Power is the sniper's primary attack's attribute, meaning the sniper will deal more damage.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fun notes</strong><br/>- Intent was to make a roguelike game where you get the high score beating continuously harder enemies.<br/>- This is mostly data driven, which is why the visuals are so meh. Not a single picture was used in the demo, only boxes.<br/>- Inspired from MOBAs. In the future, each battle you will level up and have to outpace your opponent, hence 'attrition based' <br/>- I'd love to get some Fire Emblem and Into the Breach vibes in with art. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>Created By:\u00a0<br/>- RoboZero - Solo Programmer\u00a0 <br/>Special thanks to the folks of non-profit DevLUp!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for checking out the game<strong>!
