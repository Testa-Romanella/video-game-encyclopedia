{"id": 367105, "slug": "crime-opera-the-butterfly-effect", "name": "Crime Opera: The Butterfly Effect", "name_original": "Crime Opera: The Butterfly Effect", "description": "For fans of visual novels who have been yearning for something new and exciting, these visual novels cover the lives of the Gallo crime family, from early childhood to adulthood, as they gradually become more entrenched in the Italian-American Mafia underworld. You will experience the novels from the perspectives of six main characters as they are pulled into a chaotic conflict generations in the making. <br/><br/>The first Crime Opera trilogy was written over the course of 3 and a half years, and there are plans for an entire second trilogy to be written (in order to finish the story). This first installment contains 24 full chapters, and the main route is over 64k words long. At the beginning of the game, you can choose to read it straight through as a kinetic novel (no choices), or as a visual novel with choices that lead to other endings. These endings, while false in nature, *do* shed more light on characters and their motivations, revealing a much fuller picture of major events and how they were sparked into being.<br/><br/><br/><strong>PLOT</strong><br/><br/>This first novel follows six narrators in their childhood, and focuses on their introduction into the Mafia world (through their parents). The story begins with the sudden death of the family matriarch and subsequently spins out of control when her two sons, Gerald and Xander, are put on the defensive, as former partners threaten to take over their collective business ventures for themselves. See through the eyes of the Gallo children as they witness murders, kidnappings, and a slew of other crimes wrought upon their households by their own fathers. <br/><br/>Crime Opera is a tale of both loyalty and deceit, murder and survival, and both the strength and frailty of familial bonds. These visual novels follow the Gallos as they are pitted against the outside forces of the mafia world, and eventually, each other as well.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T02:42:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294dd2e520e23a99508897618797eeb4.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/CrimeOpera", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 15, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Crime Opera Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Crime Opera Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
