If trees don't disappear just reassign them. Reduced some visual settings for performance reasons. Thank you for understanding.)</p>\n<p>------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was created by me alone over the course of 5 weeks and submitted to AdmiralBahroos \"summer\" themed art contest on June 2nd 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Bahroos Amazing Panda Summer Camp</strong> is a game about a chaotic horde of pandas building up a campsite in a bamboo forest near the beach. The players tasks include assigning work and placing buildings while the AI controlled pandas walk around mining for jade, logging and needing food and sleep.</p>\n\r\nPanda food and rest bars\r\n\n<p>Twitch chat has the opportunity to influence the players experience by using bits to trigger certain commands. The game was played on stream by AdmiralBahroo for about 20 minutes (link).</p>\n\n<p>The game features twitch integration which i have disabled for the sake of itch presentation (check the recording linked above). Instead there will be non-viewer created avatars running around.</p>\n<p>I do not own the rights to Bahroos mascots and some of the fonts and soundeffects are downloaded (and edited). I created all the art, animation, vfx, music, code and design. Made in Unity.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot from doing this project and just now got around uploading it. Congratulations to all the winners and thanks to Bahroo for hosting the contest.</p>\n<p>Lastly thanks to the amazing people that gave feedback and helped me stay motivated &lt;3</p>\n<p>Cheers, Ajamajan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T18:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e246a214d8b8c021aec7e145af9d8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ajamajan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
