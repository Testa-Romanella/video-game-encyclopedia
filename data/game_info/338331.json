{"id": 338331, "slug": "under-what", "name": "Under What?", "name_original": "Under What?", "description": "\u201cUnder what?\u201d is a short but very capacious story-tale about an old fisherman who suddenly faced the surface of the water. In this story there will be no dragons, the battle of good and evil, and other boring nonsense. But there will be some bad jokes and extraordinary characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis visual novel is absolutely free (so if you think to sell it to someone, do not forget to share the earnings). It doesn\u2019t require on-time spell casting and late game artefacts. It is recommended in a relaxed atmosphere with a cup of tea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI would call this project an interactive comic rather than a visual novel or game. I spent much more time on development than I thought.
