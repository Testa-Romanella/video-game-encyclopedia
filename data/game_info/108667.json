This has been our project for the last 2 and a half months. Will still be rolling out updates in the near future. There are a few bugs that we are aware of and will be fixed in future updates. </p><p>The game will only begin when there are at least TWO PLAYERS connected on the same server, AT LEAST ONE HIDER and ONE SEEKER. The game will begin with a 30 second count down to give the hider enough time to run and hide. After that the seeker is free, so make sure you hide well!</p><p>Seeker Controls:</p><p>Arrow Keys - Character Movement</p><p>E - Interact with Doors/Stairs</p><p>F - Search for Hider (Use on objects within the level)</p><p>Hider Controls:</p><p>Arrow Keys - Character Movement</p><p>E - Interact with Doors/Stairs, to hide and to un hide.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2ad498c908e52fe3f1629494c7b33a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TurnCloak Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
