While I've been designing games for a few years now, I've always had trouble with programming. I've been lucky enough to work with some great programmers to do the heavy lifting. Despite taking many 101 courses over the years, coding has never stuck. This year I've decided to change that. </p><p>This project is part of the \"Learn to Code by Making Games\" project on Udemy by Ben Tristen. Its a great course if you're looking to learn coding in Unity.</p><p>This project uses a finite state machine simply shifting text based on the state your in. Key press events move you from state to state. The course example is of a prison escape but I've re-written the story to be about being buried alive.</p><p>Notable features beyond the scope include:</p><ul><li>Background Color Changes / Animation</li><li>Sound Effects</li></ul><p>I had more fun than I thought I would with a Text Adventure game. I've been thinking about adding in the ability to use a mouse to select your choices, but I'm not sure if I will.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d04aa521b95f6af3d95f7b448b9ca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CraigItsFryday"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
