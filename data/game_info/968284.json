Puzzles can have multiple solutions as you guide the protagonist - Detective Will Stanhope - through the story.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStanhope will sometimes be presented with alternative ways to handle a conversation, based on four temperaments:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMelancholic (detail oriented)<br/>\r\nPhlegmatic (calm)<br/>\r\nSanguine (sociable)<br/>\r\nCholeric (driven)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no one approach that works best for all conversations, and Stanhope will need to use all of them in order to be the best he can be.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game adapts to your choices. People will remember how Stanhope spoke to them and may respond differently in the future, so consider each response carefully. Will Stanhope's destiny is in your hands.
