It had some programming challenges and it wasn't always easy to stay on it. But I finally finished it and I am very happy about it. If you notice any bugs or mistakes, or if you just want to give a simple feedback I am always glad! Give it a try and go for the biggest plant as fast as possible ;) - Let the Golden Plants be with you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ef/1ef49bc5037e9b2bff04dcf6291d6290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Schimauscha"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
