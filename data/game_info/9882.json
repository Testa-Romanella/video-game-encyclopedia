Initially, Don&#39;t Starve is a single-player game with a core mechanic of going through various problems of your character. You have to sleep and eat well. Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don&#39;t go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don&#39;t Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>\n<p>While heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don&#39;t Starve.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dd5/dd50d4266915d56dd5b63ae1bf72606a.jpg", "website": "http://www.dontstarvegame.com", "rating": 3.77, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 348, "owned": 7080, "beaten": 349, "toplay": 128, "dropped": 1104, "playing": 168}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 1332, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1343, "platforms": ["Linux", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
