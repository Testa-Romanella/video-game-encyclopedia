You enter a spectacular universe where you fly through a gigantic system of caves. Otherworldly galaxies are everywhere to view in wonder. Sometimes when you look at a galaxy, the NovaWake composed music transforms, and the galaxies signal you with excited illuminations. <br/>\r\nThere are no hand held controllers to encumber your experience. Your flight is gentle and relaxing, because NovaWake Smooth Drive (TM) makes flying responsive yet comfortable. Be careful to remember any appointments you may have. Because, some people find Gravity Compass so relaxing, that they do not want to leave. A thirty minute flight, can seem to go by in a moment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/9883b50d48950336523240e4966be9c4.jpg", "website": "http://novawake.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NovaWake Studios"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["NovaWake Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
