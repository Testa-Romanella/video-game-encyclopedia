After 700 years in 1238, the temple was burned by Mongolian\u2019s invasion. Now few thousands of rocks and the vast empty land are remained as the traces of the history. Instead of dwelling on the glorious but unfortunate past, the space is created as a living and changing space with that remains.\r\n</p>\n<p>These monumental but unidentifiable rock relics are transformed by the participants. The participants recreate these sculptures to rediscover the meaning of that remains. This conveys the Buddhist idea: void beings contain endless values.</p>\n<p>700\ub144\ub3d9\uc548 \uc2e0\ub77c\uc758 \uc790\ub791\uc774\uc600\ub358 \uacbd\uc8fc \ud669\ub8e1\uc0ac\ucc30\uc740 \uace0\ub824 \uace0\uc885 25\ub144(1238)\uc5d0 \ubabd\uace0\uc758 \uce68\uc785\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc5d0 \ud0c0\ubc84\ub9ac\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \uc874\uc7ac\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub838\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, \uc774 \ube48\ud130\ub294 4\ub9cc\uc5ec \uc810\uc758 \uc720\ubb3c\ub4e4\uc774 \ucd9c\ud1a0\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc8fc\ucd9c\ub3cc\ub4e4\ub9cc \ub0a8\uc740 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88 &lt;\ud669\ub8e1\ubb34\uc0c1&gt;\uc740 \ud654\ub824\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc548\ud0c0\uae4c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \ud669\ub8e1\uc0ac\ucc30\uc744 \ud68c\uc0c1\ud558\ub294\uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uba48\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574\uc11c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \u201c\uc0b4\uc544\uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\u201d\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\uc9c0\uae08 \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \ud615\uc0c1\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uae30\ub150\ube44\uc801\uc778 \uc11d\ubb3c\ub4e4\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574\uc11c \ubcc0\ud615, \ubc1c\uc804\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc11d\ubb3c\ub4e4\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc7ac\ucc3d\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubb34\uc0c1\ud55c\uac83\uc740 \uace7 \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac16\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \ubd88\uad50\uc758 \u201c\uc81c\ud589\ubb34\uc0c1\u201d\uc758 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ub418\uc0c8\uae30\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/241/24112b199b3c5b72fcf22847b1ba8d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yejincolor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
