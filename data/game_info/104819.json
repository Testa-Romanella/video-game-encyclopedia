It has been nearly two years since Cello Aufiero and her mother moved to Amorina, yet despite the city's charm, Cello has yet to begin to feel at home. Like a tourist, it seems there is no place for her, and it's hard to make friends when you are only passing through.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOne day, her teacher assigns the class a project, based on one simple question: \"What is the true spirit of Amorina?\" It's a simple question indeed, but it feels impossible for an eternal tourist like Cello. Luckily, a pair of classmates comes to her rescue. Through this simple assignment, can she find true companionship? Or better yet, her true home?\r\n\t\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCerulean is a short visual novel by Pink Pomeranian Parade, created during July/August 2015 for the Summer Novel Festival (SuNoFes).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCredits [PPP Team]:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing - Laiska (@petitscygnes)</li>\n<li>Sprites/CGs - Tenshio (@10_Salt)</li>\n<li>Backgrounds/GUI - Adirosa (@adirosette)</li>\n<li>Programming - Ultra_HR (@Ultra_HR)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tOriginal music by \r\n\tSebastian Woodland.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTrailer video editing by \r\n\tRouFleur.
