In our studio, we have been tasked with creating a device that makes things. My Unity game is a multiplayer environment where players explore an endless world collecting objects. These objects leave a variety of lines behind them. The \"Creator\" (me) places green diamonds for the \"Maker\" (you) to acquire and discover what they allow you to collect. Play for as long as you like, and thank you for your participation!</p>\n<p>-Kayla (Creator)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd3/cd3eb6a592e5a8e81cb11764a7fe7ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kmgro2012"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
