It's all in the brain.</p>\n<p>This is a platforming game where risk &amp; reward is used in a fourth wall-breaking way to give the player the ability to use UI elements of the gameframe -yes you heard it right- as a part of the level!</p>\n<p>Platforms keep generating as you traverse your iconic little guy to the seemingly abyssal exit.</p>\n<p>Did you get stuck? Why not use a part of your clich\u00e9 health bar as a platform in itself?</p>\n<p>That is exactly what this game is about. You might have to sacrifice fundamental things, in order to progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f9b2164a7fa587674223e40d64159b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PixelBoii"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
