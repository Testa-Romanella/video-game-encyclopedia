However, if an enemy is directly in front of the ship, you will hear loud sirens to warn you. At this point you can either shoot the enemy down or dodge the hazard by moving left or right.</p><p>There are three different types of enemies. There is a slow asteroid, a fast alien scout, and a lightning speed alien speeder. The faster an enemy is the higher pitch the radar will be.</p><p>Rather than dodging enemies, you can instead shoot an enemy when it is directly in front of you. After you shoot your blasters, they must recharge. They will automatically recharge indicated by a whirring sound. When they finish charging, you will hear a beep indicating they are ready to be fired again. All enemies can be killed using one shot.</p><p>Simply stay alive as long as you can. The longer you live, the more you can brag!</p><p>Every game session, you will be able to set up your controls after simply starting the game. You may use any keys to play the game.</p><p><strong>Resolution Control:</strong></p><p>F1 - Default resolution</p><p>F2 - 2x resolution</p><p>F3 - 3x resolution</p><p>F4 - Fullscreen (4:3 only, sorry!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd9b6bd9612efa0b71c22542f10a04b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yukon W."], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
