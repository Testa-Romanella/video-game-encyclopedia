Unlike normal Tower Defense games, you have gathering units and resources to manage as well as your defending units that are used to attack enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This adds another strategy layer to the game where you have to make decisions every turn on what resources you want to gather and if you want to recruit a defender or a gatherer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You also need to provide food resources for your units to keep them fed and happy. If they become hungry, their stats will get weakened until they are fed again.</p>\n<p>Other than spending your resources on upgrades and new recruits, you can also spend it on buildings like farms, towers and houses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are many different approaches in playing this game, make up your own strategy and see what works. If it fails, then you can try a different approach, it is up to you how you want to play this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:12:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f996bd695f18e3fa8b41a8fad13785c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["augustlewen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
