About 99% of the time, they never come back or the other 1% just don't remember anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's time for you to escape and warn everybody that this is not a joke.</p>\n<p><em>Can you escape?</em></p>\n<p>A small game developed in pico-8 by a small indie team, Team SKYNITE. A test game in a series of games that we are planning for the Game Off 2019. Our goal was to see if we can complete a game as junior developers/hobbyists. This was our first time making a game together as well as building a game (I\u00a0work as a Web Developer). So we learned as we went and it was fun.\u00a0With the completion of our first simple game, we decided to take on another project to continue the storyline (with actual story!)</p>\n<p>Development time: 2 days<br/>website: https://teamskynite.net</p>\n<p>Team:<br/>Nikki X - Main Programmer<br/>Matt S - Level Design/Coder<br/>Mei S - Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7a/b7a75b4c9cd1140a22205ce267985f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DjKniteX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
