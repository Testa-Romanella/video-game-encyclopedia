Play it however is most comfortable for you, but play it long and hard.</p><p>There is also an online high-score board. See if you can get further and score higher than your peers.</p><p>There is no DRM of any kind - show your friends and copy for free but if they like the game please point them here to help pay for my coffee addiction, thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b0382ad43bde2f0ecc3cc3c7a15ba34b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Caffeine Kid"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
