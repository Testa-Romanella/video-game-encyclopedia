Do you want to play safe and build a secure path? Go ahead. Or maybe you're more adventurous and want to dig right into the exit... Well, good luck!</p>\n<p>You control the player with\u00a0<strong>A\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>D\u00a0</strong> (left and right) and\u00a0<strong>SPACE\u00a0</strong> to Jump. But don't think you're gonna go far with this, you need your droid companion, together you're stronger.</p>\n<p>Your droid has\u00a0<strong>3 modes</strong>:</p>\n<p>1) speed/jump boost\u00a0<br/>2) destroy platforms<br/>3) create platforms<br/><br/>Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Music The Most Beautiful\u00a0by\u00a0\u00a0snabisch<br/>SFX made with jsfxr</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The inspiration for this project came from Vimlark's video where he shows his GameJAM's games (here). There was a game called B.U.D.D, a platformer where the main character has a droid companion that can attack, be a jump pad, and a lot more. I loved the idea and tried to gave my spin on it.</p>\n<p>This is my first 2D game. I've just purchased Game Maker Studio 2 (actually 10 days ago) and started to mess around. I loved it. And since I was practicing a bit with Aseprite, I've decided to jump right on the JAM and do my best to learn more and create a fun little game. I hope you like it and, if you want to, follow me on social media (I use\u00a0<strong>@mathewcst\u00a0</strong>everywhere).</p>\n<p>Thanks again for playing my game, I would love some feedback. You can comment here or send me a message on twitter (@mathewcst).</p>\n<p>Bye bye</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21fb7803e0e70d5ec282460e7a9b8d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matheus Costa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
