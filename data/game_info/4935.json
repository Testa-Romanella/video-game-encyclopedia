Choose one of eight colorfully animated characters to battle using your block-busting powers against their fortified encampments.  You know the game: use your ball to break a series of bricks walls by ricocheting your ball off a moving paddle.  You'll be able to bounce your balls over their barriers to get more points and score special power-ups.  Your viewpoint can vary as the game allows you to play from a 3D perspective, right behind the paddle.  Or play from a more traditional top-down angled perspective and enjoy the fun of this Japanese classic.  <br/><br/>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.  Although text is limited, it is in the original Japanese language.
