Our age of machinery is not an exception: we are facing the rise of pure Luciferian technomagic. The application we present has been created for all left-hand path scholars practicing different kinds of Sabbatic Arts. Here you will find 22 dark portals to guide you on the way to your inner black hole of selfhood. <br/><br/>We intend this work as an antidote for the partial and incomplete understanding of the mysteries usually offered by the Tarot cards. This work\u2019s method is to add potent poison where it was lacking from Tarot, so that the dosage becomes lethal enough to kill the initiate and to raise him or her back to life, transformed. Those who have already undergone the initiatory transformation will find this poison to be as wine of ecstasy.<br/><br/>By using these cards you invoke the desire that your questions, thoughts, challenges and events gain an initiatory meaning for you and become part of your occult path.<br/><br/>We have deliberately put a high price on the application in order to prevent occult kiddies and wannabes from contacting the forces of the primordial Darkness and Fire. Do you dare take up its challenge? <br/><br/>Disclaimer:<br/>Use this application at your own risk. There is no guarantee of any success, and even a high chance of failure. Do not undertake this working until you are completely sure of your psychic health.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/422/42200d941687feef82c27df5492e73c1.jpg", "website": "http://satanicpress.com/sabbatic-tarot/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Maxim Orlovsky"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Maxim Orlovsky"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
