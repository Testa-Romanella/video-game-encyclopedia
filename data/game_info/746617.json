I am quite happy with the finished product, but it definitely could be improved. For example, the pause menu looks like it was thrown together in 2 minutes, as I just didn't have enough time to get more than the base functionality. I did spend quite along on polishing, optimizing\u00a0and improving the graphics, which could have been levelled out to suit my time a bit more if I planned out the more important goals better.\r\n\n\n\n<p><strong>.Many Useful Assets Were Used For This Project.
