This instantly creates new patterns to learn, that you need to solve the puzzles. But it doesn't stop there. There are eight new mechanics to learn like X number of mines in a given area or Y number of mines in a chain. With 92 levels to complete, there is so much fun to be had!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T06:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9baf3afc6dc7c1af0e4ae2e2b9cb4700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Incandescent Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Incandescent Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
