The wealthy elite took refuge on the west side, while the impoverished working class were forced to the east. The only thing connecting the two is a single draw-bridge over the chasm, and the large, multi-leveled control tower keeping it closed 99% of the time. When Francis, the control tower's elevator operator, overhears the president say another earthquake is coming, he knows that thousands of people on the poorer east side will die. Thus, he must lower the bridge to give them all a chance to evacuate. The issue? The bridge requires six keys--and six hands to turn them all at once. Can Francis convince the tower's keyholders to risk their jobs and their livelihoods and make a sacrifice for strangers across the chasm?</p>\n<p><strong>CREATORS NOTE</strong></p>\n<p>We ended up planning for a project that was way out of scope for the jam, so we ended up just creating one level out of the entire story that we built! There were a lot of assets and story we worked on that didn\u2019t make it into the final submission, but we figured it was better to turn in something than nothing. We had a great time regardless and hope you enjoy the little sliver of the game we planned for!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Amber Avara</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Animation, Level Design, Level Creation</p>\n<p><strong>Bella Gutierrez</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Animation, Character Design, Level Design</p>\n<p><strong>Connie Yoon</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Character Design</p>\n<p><strong>Sammy Abigail</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Level Design, Level Creation, Sound Design</p>\n<p><strong>Shawna Zhou</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Prop Design</p>\n<p><strong>Yvonne Liu</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Environment Design, Character Design, Prop Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T18:06:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf04f75f416f19c6de1fd6da296c085a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sammy Gerolaga"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
