This is a demo of my debut project, a short, hand-drawn, narrative RPG called\u00a0\"Unfinished Business\" about helping ghosts complete their last requests. Right now only the first four ghosts are included; the final game will include eight ghost quests, as well as an original soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you encounter any bugs or glitches. The game is still very much a work in progress from a first-time solo developer, so I appreciate any help at pointing out oversights or errors. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T21:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/0779f211c0fd7bca78f68af9013fd130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Headstone Hills"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
