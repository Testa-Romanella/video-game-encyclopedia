For the pyramid puzzle I made a paper based model to help visualise the challenge and create a combination so that I knew exactly what to do when it came to building it in Unity.</p>\n<p>I was quite proud of the puzzles included as they were the first I ever created in 3D. While creating them I gained a little bit more experience with scripting in C#.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T07:00:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb7287f6e9d3922df112fe5178943c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
