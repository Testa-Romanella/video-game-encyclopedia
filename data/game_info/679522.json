Choosing to focus my attention on the impact of food waste, I developed Food for Thought.</p>\n<p>In Food for Thought, players must complete tasks and save food from going to waste by sharing with other villagers. Through these actions, communities are built up to ensure no one goes hungry.</p>\n<p>My hope with Food for Thought was for players to look for opportunities in their local communities to make a difference in people's lives.</p>\n<p>The assets for the game came from a Unity Kit. I have modified the gameplay code to portray my gameplay loop.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move the avatar using the Arrow keys (Also, used to select dialogue options)</li><li>Approach NPCs to interact with them</li><li>Use the space bar to progress dialogue</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T08:06:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970c4b7eab23ba077992bdc95abdd40e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LorenPenny"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
