Second, I want to invite you all to playtest the first level.</p>\n<p>It is meant to be an easy level because it's Level 1 but eventually as the story progresses, (yes, there is a story), the levels will get more complex and difficult.</p>\n<p>You will also make decisions that will influence your gameplay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is set in the future when Earth is dying from overpopulation and exhausted resources. The main character Mac is a space explorer that must find alternative worlds that could be habitable, as well as supplies for his fellow humans.\u00a0</p><p>You can use \"E\" key for destroying an enemy, I am working on better mechanics for the fighting system right now.</p><p>Use right and left arrow keys to move, and Spacebar to jump.\u00a0</p><p>Be sure to click the sound button in the corners so you can hear the awesome music by David KBD!</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the short demo, please leave me some feedback and consider a small donation as 10% of funds I get for my games will go towards supporting research for Huntington's Disease (to the HDSA). I have the disease myself and have lost a lot of family members from it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you so much!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T04:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f8654b22ac6ec025c07a59e4245ec0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LonghornGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
