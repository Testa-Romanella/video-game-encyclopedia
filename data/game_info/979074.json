{"id": 979074, "slug": "rift-wizard-2", "name": "Rift Wizard 2", "name_original": "Rift Wizard 2", "description": "Rift Wizard 2 is a tough as nails traditional roguelike wizard simulator.  You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must journey through the cosmos to defeat his nemesis.  Each run, you'll build a unique repertoire of spells, passive skills, and magical artifacts.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A massive list of unique spells, skills, and equipment means there are myriads of potential builds to explore, and procedurally generated levels mean every run presents the player with different challenges.  Your wizard will grow incredibly powerful by the game's conclusion, but tricky foes will attempt to grind whatever elaborate magical engine you have built to a halt.  You must not only consider the end goal of your build, but how you will get there, and how to navigate the challenges along the way without derailing your spellbook into a useless pile of antisynergy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rift Wizard's unique portal system means the player always has agency over what challenges they face.  You choose which levels to visit, where to start, and how to spend your resources.  There is no stealth or stair dancing in Rift Wizard: you must face each level head on and obliterate your foes with whatever tools you possess.  Rift Wizard eschews randomness and complex combat formulas in favor of puzzle-like simplicity, where every game piece is easily understandable.  Every victory is earned, every death deserved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>New in Rift Wizard 2 is the equipment system, allowing the player to find unique and powerful items each run that interact with the spells and passive skills in deep and exciting ways.  Randomized equipment can perform crucial bridging functions in your build, allowing access to playstyles not otherwise possible: you could for instance, find a helmet that redeals all your ice damage as poison damage, opening up completely new uses for your poison spells.  You could find a staff that converts fire damage to free Mercurize casts, unlocking a Mercurize-fire damage build which surely would make no sense in any other run.  Or you might just find massive numbers of radius bonuses that make your fireballs way larger than normal.  Every run perturbs the balance of the game in a way that emphasizes player creativity and on-the-fly decision making over the execution of pre-existing builds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rift Wizard 2 adds many new enemies to the game, including massive multitile monsters, new wizards, and procedurally generated variant monsters.  You've fought ogres but have you fought Fae Ogres?  Lich Ogres?  Burning Ogres? Wereogres?  Immortal Bone Wizards?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along with the equipment system, the basic game mechanics have been rebalanced and revamped.  HP and spell charges are recharged at the end of every level, but potions are much rarer.  Damage redeals no longer work through immunity, demanding more carefully diversified spellbooks.  SP is much harder to come by in the early game.  Spell upgrades are now much more powerful, but limited to one per spell, encouraging bigger spellbooks that spread skill and equipment bonuses over many spells.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The goal of Rift Wizard 2 is to continually place the player in high pressure tactical situations that challenge their creativity and analytic abilities, and to create a strategic sandbox that rewards brilliance, experimentation, and adaptation to constantly changing circumstances.  To create a sandbox that generates an infinite sequence of challenging and engaging wizard puzzles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T06:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/dae186b541d20056529c0cd54f93a3a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dylan White"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dylan White"], "esrb_rating": null}
