You will not only have to solve puzzles while exploring liminal spaces but also avoid encounters with a certain entity known as <strong>BOYKISSER</strong>, who dwells within these walls and is already aware of your presence.<br/><br/>Among the white walls and cold light, numerous dark secrets hide, and every step you take may lead to the discovery of something new or a confrontation with something ominous. BOYKISSER, a mystical creature that has become your pursuer, adds an element of fear and uncertainty. Its presence is felt in the air, and every rustle may be a harbinger of its proximity.<br/><br/>To stay alive and escape, you'll have to solve puzzles hidden somewhere in the depths of utility rooms. The reward for solving puzzles will be clues that help you unlock the password for the code-locked door marked \"Exit.\" Your intellect and memory will be constantly tested, and your nerves will be on edge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T06:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16a/16abecefa0d477ef8e044c31e1bb3f59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["akhsotoen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["akhsotoen"], "esrb_rating": null}
