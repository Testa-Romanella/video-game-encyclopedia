Beware of <em>teachers</em> roaming the halls, they'll put you right back in detention.</p>\n<p>You have 3 gauges that, when filled, will cause you to produce a sound that may alert the teachers around you. You need to keep an eye on them.<br/>- Sneezes<br/>- Farts<br/>- Stomach growls</p>\n<p>To move around the map, you can:<br/>- Walk (slow and quiet)<br/>- Run  (fast, but noisy and makes you hungry)<br/>- Dash gassily (instant, but noisy and limited)</p>\n\n<p>There are 4 keys you need to collect. After that, you need to find the exit.<br/>If a teacher catches you, you'll be sent right back to detention.<br/>After 3 strikes, who knows?
