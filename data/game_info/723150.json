It stresses the fish out when you do that. Having a fuller aquarium will fill up the treasure chest faster. Fish will die if they get too hungry or too stressed. Good luck!</p>\n<p>This is my first game on itch.io!\u00a0I made this game for\u00a0Trijam 152. The basics were done in around three hours, and then I spent an extra hour debugging and making fish assets. All the assets feel pretty rushed, but, I think that's the vibe here. The theme is \"Leave me alone!\" which made me think of fish who just want to be left alone, touching the glass too much will kill them all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I had more time I would make the Shop and other modals pretty, add volume sliders, wayyy more fish, etc.</p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0ZapSplat.com. Sound effects from\u00a0Mixkit.co.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b2/0b25fb69981e91d985731678dff3eacb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IfThenCreate"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
