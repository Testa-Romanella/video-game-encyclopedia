Except... every time you enter, the map <strong>changes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Find all of your Supplies and return to your tent while avoiding <strong>it</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't look at it for too long either, or it'll move and put you into <strong>shock</strong>. Find Permanent Items and Syringes to help you get back without getting caught...<br/>- Play on\u00a0<em>3</em> difficulties!<br/>- Some unlockables!<br/>- Different <strong>endings</strong> for each difficulty!<br/>- Achievements!<br/>- Secrets!<br/>- Items!<br/>- And More!</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the game is only in alpha (very early build), and most of the story will be hidden in-game in the <strong>full version</strong>. But I'll tell you this... <em>you're seeing things...</em></p>\r\n\r\nKeyActionWASDMove<br/>Left ShiftSprintLeft ClickCollectEItems MenuSpaceToggle FlashlightEscapePause (See Supplies\u00a0\u00a0&amp; Permanent Items)\r\n\n<p>Okay, so this may seem like a generic slender-clone, and yeah it <em>kinda</em> is... but in the future, I plan to make this game much more challenging and different with more secrets, items, enemies, and a bigger map. And naming the main antagonist \"it\" is overdone and unoriginal, so I'm working on that...</p>\n<p>This is one of the first games I made with mostly <strong><em>Custom Music!</em></strong> So, if your ears are bleeding, that's why! 30+ Tracks/Short Themes with more in the future! I would have put notifications in-game containing updates and stuff, but Unity needs to update their assets and once that happens I'll add it in soon enough.</p>\n<p>Heavily influenced by Slender and The Binding of Issac, this project began in February 2018, and it was mainly all made by one person (me), so... it's not perfect!</p>\n<p>Lastly, I've encountered a few serious bugs that I'll patch later that make the game <em>too</em> easy, so enjoy it while you can!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the game!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Click Me for Credits!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f7339704cce805d2c5a7509da909daf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Low Light Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
