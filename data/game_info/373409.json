{"id": 373409, "slug": "coal-demo-day-28", "name": "Coal Demo Day 28", "name_original": "Coal Demo Day 28", "description": "<p>EDIT: Just posted a Windows hotfix to fix default mouse sensitivity. I don't have access to my Linux dev environment right now, but if your sensitivity is way too low, go to the menu and set them accordingly in the gameplay options menu. If the max is *still* too low, edit the config.cfg in your user folder and edit the sensitivity_x and sensitivity_y values.<br/></p>\n<p>Now featuring 2 new enemy types, a slightly expanded level 2 and 3, some new weapon models, snapshots in save games, decals, and lots of fixes. And Vulkan!</p>\n<p>Remember the \"frob\" key (default F) - you use it to toggle switches and open<br/>doors. You'll know if you can \"frob\" something if you see the orange corners<br/>of a reticle on your screen. This isn't Quake, you can't open doors just by<br/>touching them!</p>\n<p>You have multiple saving options, with a dedicated \"quick\" save slot, along<br/>with 3 hard saves, selectable in the main/pause menus. By default, F5 will<br/>quick save and F9 will quick load.</p>\n<p>Screenshots and the config file are stored in your user folder along with saves.<br/>On Windows, the user folder is <username>/AppData/Roaming/Coal. On Linux, this will be set to XDG_DATA_HOME if it exists, then fall back to \"<home>/.local/share/Coal\" if it doesn't. People with non-ASCII OS languages/usernames, let me know if these saves appear in the right place!</home></username></p>\n<p>The lowest recommended resolution is 1024x768. Lower ones technically work, but menu elements will be clipped.</p>\n<p>Certain menus like the game options and bindings menus have a scroll bar<br/>to view more. You can use your mousewheel or click on the bar to move up<br/>and down.</p>\n<p>Please try the Vulkan renderer (vkcoal.exe for Windows users, vkcoal.sh for Linux users) if you have the drivers. I'm curious to see how it works on other computers.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you experience any rendering glitches. I'm using a new method of rendering maps in batches, which was showing artifacts on my Linux laptop that I had to write a fallback for. If you do see glitches, please send me the contents of your log.txt file found in the same folder as your save games (see above).</p>\n<p>Default Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0W/S/A/D:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Move around<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mouse:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Look around<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0LMB:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fire weapon<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0C:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Crouch/Uncrouch, Ground Slide (while running)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Shift:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Run (while moving)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Spacebar:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Jump<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Capslock:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Toggle Always Run<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0F12:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Take screenshot<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0F:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Use/frob<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0~:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Open developer console (hardcoded)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0F5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Quick Save<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0F9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Quick Load<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Mousewheel\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Cycle available weapons<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Number Keys\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Select available weapons<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6df/6df3d6aa5da1ad5bdf0a027516e5174a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rohit"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
