Time has stopped existing and you need to find 12 pieces of time on this planet. Time does not exist, but you can benefit from that. You are able to undo every action you did, because time does not pass, so why not undo death of your companion, or any wrong move you made. Also you are able to stop enemies from moving. You have to find 12 pieces of time to return time to the normal. You ask why? Because bad guys can do the same thing we can (undo and stop everything), that we can not let happen. Find other astronauts on the planet to help you. This is space, there is no light, so if you find lighthouse it will help.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Move - WSAD</p>\n<p>Undo - Space</p>\n<p>Stop enemies\u2019 movement - F (Missing UI.\u00a0 After 60 seconds you can use this power up, after 10 moves it stops, and again after 60 seconds you can use it)</p>\n<p>Change player - E</p>\n<p>Stand on blue field to spawn lighthouse or another player</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T14:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06e07187ed98033ad23649fe89710d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uros Spasenovic"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
