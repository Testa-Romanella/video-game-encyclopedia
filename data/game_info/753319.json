{"id": 753319, "slug": "ygogoth", "name": "Y'gogoth", "name_original": "Y'gogoth", "description": "<p><em>\"Wellhaven is no longer well...\"</em></p>\n<p>A short game of trundling the countryside, driving humanity insane. Grow bigger, stronger and worse the more 'followers of Gog' you turn, but be careful not to let them bear your presence too long - that following may start to dwindle, and we wouldn't want that.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for Quad Game Jam #1, with the theme \"don't kill anything\". The alternative to killing NPCs I chose was a recruitment system of sorts, and through about ten seconds of ideation leaned hard into Lovecraftian horror concepts to create what is essentially a Katamari Damacey fangame. There's differences, of course, but it was evident early on that originality is dead. I'd gotten too attached to the idea to switch by then so here we are.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move with WASD/Arrows. <br/>Anyone within your area of influence will begin to go mad, displaying their progress above them. Insanity is reached at half their meter, but they can still be influenced - if their meter fills entirely, the human dies.</li><li>Eventually you'll gain the power to \"enact your influence from afar\", which is a fancy way of saying you can drop a madness bomb with the Left Mouse button and speed up the process.<br/>These 'bombs' are infinite but need to recharge between uses - that charge speed decreases the stronger you become.</li><li>Finally, you'll later be able to turn invisible by holding the Right Mouse button.<br/>While invisible you won't be able to influence humans very much and your movement speed will increase, which will make it easier to stop yourself killing 'innocent' humans the larger you become.</li><li>... give the third (last) area a minute or two to load. It's had a hard day.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>REMINDER: THIS IS A GAME JAM ENTRY</strong><br/>This isn't my defence for making something that isn't fun or of a certain quality (though I admit neither graphic design or level design are my passion), but one for how untested the final product is.<br/>I hit several walls in the last day - as I believe is traditional - and due to catastrophic loss of drive likely let some bugs or straight-up unplayable bits slip through the cracks. Of course, when I say cracks, I mean holes. Chasms. Whoops. Have fun anyway!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fa7a27d321eca3b7ceb3c8f6ea20ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sheen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
