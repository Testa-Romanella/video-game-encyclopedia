The player simply needs to\u00a0look at a wall to start building.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective and Instructions for how to play</strong></p>\n<p>\u25cbAs the game starts, you are put into a room and you will immediately be\u00a0placing blocks into the scene (on walls, floors, or on other blocks). An\u00a0alarm will sound when a projectile will be hurdling toward you and you\u00a0must build quick enough to obstruct the projectile and avoid being hit. If\u00a0you succeed in building quickly enough, you will progress to the next\u00a0level. However, if you are hit, it is game over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Link to assets</strong></p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://freesound.org/people/ThompsonMan/sounds/107341/</p>\n\n<p>\u25cbhttps://freesound.org/people/fotoshop/sounds/47356/</p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://sketchfab.com/3d-models/plasma-ball-6750448d80d34c2a9b24985070f4de02</p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://sketchfab.com/3d-models/radioactive-space-box-10968c259c864e0a8647308a732362e3</p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://www.cgtrader.com/items/703842/download-page</p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://freesound.org/people/Luzanne0/sounds/445331/</p>\n<p>\u25cbhttps://freesound.org/people/edtijo/sounds/210737/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d30008b246d6e36f91238e371e8bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Crimzen"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
