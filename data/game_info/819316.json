There are several tile types, Enemy spawn tiles, Pillars, and basic tiles, among others. You can place the tiles wherever you like, just not on top of tiles that have already been placed. You can't remove the tiles once they are placed.</p>\n<p>WSAD moves the character, LEFT CLICK fires the gun,\u00a0 RIGHT CLICK places the tile\u00a0 into the world. SPACE to dash. When dashing, you're impervious to bullets.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I originally wanted there to be some sort of boss that was summoned by placing tiles of a particular type in a particular configuration, but I ran out of time. Oh, well. Anyway, placing tiles and killing enemies contributes to your score which will be shown when you die.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:57:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/363/363fda7057b5d119842ddfc888a70525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aragatodag"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
