A Hallowed Tale was developed over a year for my senior thesis in college and completed for my graduation in early 2015. Before releasing it here I fixed a number of glitches and added a few visual flares that were always intended, but weren't originally included for the sake of time.</p><p>     The story and characters are something I still hold dear, and I learned an incredible amount trying to bring a small part of it to life. It's rather simple and there's a lot to be desired design wise, but It's a stepping stone to what I hope are more polished personal projects in the future.</p><p>      It should work with most gamepads, but you can also play with a keyboard using Z , X , C , left CTRL, and the arrow keys if need be. (Tap up to talk)</p><p>The music was done by my friend Levi Davis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468626da4104b692b085ae55c6d10f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["harrisonbright"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
