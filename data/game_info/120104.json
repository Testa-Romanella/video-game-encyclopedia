Currently it is somewhere between a prototype and an alpha version. It still misses some planned features and does neither have a pretty interface nor proper level design.</p>\n<p>The 3D assets were bought from the Unity Asset store and might be replaced at some later point.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Feedback:</em></strong></p>\n<p>I will be happy to receive any feedback.
