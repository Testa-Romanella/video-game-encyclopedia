Unfortunately, the pigeons charge at you when you get close and jump into the OE and slow it down even more.</p>\n<p>The levels are timed and the time limit is probably too long. There's also a pretty annoying bug that fills your OE with birds when you idle on the station. Whoops!</p>\n<p>The best way to experience the game in its current form is to drive around to pick up some birds and take them back to the station. Then when you feel you've done enough of that, you can press\u00a0the + sign on the NumPad to advance to the next level to at least get to see all of the artwork and enjoy the story. (Be sure to try the upgraded OE on Day 4 and 5!)</p>\n<p>We learned a lot during this jam and hopefully we can make an update in the future to address the issues above.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for all the great feedback!\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Murder</strong>:\u00a0<em>\"Collective noun for a group of crows\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>Plague:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<em>\"Verb. worry, annoy, harass, harry, pester, tease mean to disturb or irritate by persistent acts.\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys/JoyStick to move</p>\n<p>Spacebar/A button to advance scene and pause</p>\n<p>+ on NumPad: Go to next day</p>\n<p>- on NumPad:\u00a0Go to previous day</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Art:\u00a0Sophia Hsu<br/></p>\n<p>Programming, SFX, Story: John Boyle</p>\n<p>Design Support:\u00a0Jerry Boyle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cd/5cd7dfd3ecf886520dfd283a0aca995e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jmbjr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
