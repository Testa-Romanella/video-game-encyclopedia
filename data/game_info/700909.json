Sing the melodies from your scroll <em>(given to all\u00a0wizard apprentices on this year's second lecture, you shouldn't have lost it)</em> by pressing the <strong>arrow key</strong><strong>s</strong> or the<strong> A, S and D key</strong><strong>s </strong>to summon the Ocean Cleaning spell,\u00a0<em>(You can find out\u00a0more about it on your textbook in case you didn't pay attention during class)</em>\u00a0and get rid of the garbage. Also, don't get discouraged if you keep messing up the spells, you can always try again. I'm saying this because we've noticed that most novice wizards usually lack self-confidence,\u00a0get discouraged quickly and<strong> can not keep singing</strong> if their <strong>confidence bar gets depleted</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, that's all from me. Take care, and do to the best of your ability. \"</p>\n<p>The back of the letter is empty.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Press the notes when they get close to the white bar.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left Arrow/A</strong>: Circle</li><li><strong>Down Arrow/S</strong>: Triangle</li><li><strong>Right Arrow/D</strong>: Square</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Art, (some of the) code and (most of the) music by me.
