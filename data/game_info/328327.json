{"id": 328327, "slug": "greyknurl-diahaze", "name": "Greyknurl Diahaze", "name_original": "Greyknurl Diahaze", "description": "<p>A fairly old-school puzzle game cast in a cyberpunky world. Turn-based and thoughtful, approachable in different ways. Follow a lore path or a points-scoring path if you prefer. Learn some fun new abstract puzzle elements and push some blocks around!<br/><br/>Use the cursor keys to move, z and x when necessary. Everything is explained a little in-game but experimentation teaches you the game best.<br/></p>\n<p>All this made in pico-8, an all-in-one environment for tiny games! This game will be free of charge forever; if you like the concept or you like the music, then thank you, and if you want to send me a little money, visit my profile for a link to my patreon site where you can subscribe for as little as you like. No obligation, a comment here and there is just as welcome!</p>\n<p>game by Zan-zan-zawa-veia, made over June and July of 2019, learning precarious lua code as I went.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/425bee785781a03114dc823effb0afef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zan-zan-zawa-veia"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
