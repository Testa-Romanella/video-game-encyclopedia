They will then drop a soul or two, that you can plant in the ground to create a grave, and when this grave is a headstone you can pick it up to collect a skull.</p>\n\n<p>The game was made for the <strong>TWIST</strong> game jam by <strong>JokubasG </strong>and <strong>Deja View</strong><br/>Thanks for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game - JokubasG</p>\n<p>Art - Deja View</p>\n<p>Music\u00a0 - \u201cChamber of Secrets\u201d, from PlayOnLoop.com<br/>Licensed under\u00a0Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0</p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0Silkscreen,\u00a0\u00a0designed by\u00a0Jason Kottke</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T09:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32f/32f8cc1cd70361949808aca6975ff532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JokubasG", "Deja View"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
