You can use the fire to cook food, but cooking changes the amount of health, thirst and hunger values the food\u00a0can restore.\u00a0You constantly have to feed the fire with wood in order to be able to cook. You have two food sources: you can collect bananas from the palm tree, or catch fish on the dock.\u00a0\u00a0The dock deteriorates over time, so be sure to repair it with wood, otherwise you won't be able to fish. You can get wood from the water as it floates by, but be careful as something might be lurking in the water!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Collect wood</li><li>Feed the fire with wood</li><li>Reapir the dock with wood</li><li>Collect bananas</li><li>Catch fish</li><li>Cook over the fire</li><li>Avoid the shark</li><li>Keep your thirst, hunger and health meter up</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls/How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move around</li><li>Mouse: Look around</li><li>LMB: Pick up banana/wood, select item in inventory</li><li>F: Fishing (when at the end of the dock)</li><li>R: Repair dock (when on the dock)</li><li>I: Open/Close inventory</li><li>Eat: Select item in inventory and choose the 'Eat' option</li><li>Cook: Select item in inventory near the fire and choose the 'Cook' option</li><li>Esc: Quit to main menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to install:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Download the zip</li><li>Right click on it and \"Extract All...\"</li><li>Run \"Chill and Survive.exe\"</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>I created this game as a university project in the span of a semester, so it is far from perfect and can contain some bugs.</p>\n<p>There is no end game, you just have to stay alive for as long as you'd like.
