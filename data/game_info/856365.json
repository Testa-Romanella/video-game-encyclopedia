The picket has long since dissolved and traffic has started flowing once more. The rules state the protest is recognised as long as someone remains in the protest zone and the people will be made aware of the issue! So it's your job to stay in the zone lest people forget how evil the government is!</p>\n<p>Watch out for the cars! They don't care about you.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys</p>\r\nIdeas\r\n<p>I had a couple of ideas for the jam. One was a game where the player tries to escape from a maze like prison by bashing through the walls but for each level of wall, more would spawn between the player and the exit. The submitted idea felt like a far simpler game and while I had some trouble implementing some of the functionality (despite an attempt at a similar idea for last week's jam which went much smoother) I think it came together quite nicely.<br/></p>\r\nBugs\r\n<ul><li>Cars spawn on top of each other sometimes despite my best efforts to stop this.\u00a0Doesn't\u00a0effect gameplay but\u00a0just\u00a0looks\u00a0ugly!</li><li>The cars and pedestrians collide.</li></ul>\r\nHopeful Improvements\r\n<p>After the jam I would like to address the following issues/improvements.<br/></p>\n<p>Have the pedestrians cause more problems to the player. The way the player moves it largely ignores the effects of the pedestrians at the moment. I was hoping to have it so that you could get blocked in by them but it didn't work out.</p>\n<p>Have the cars be smart enough not to collide with each other and the pedestrians stop/turn the corner.</p>\n<p>Add buildings to the streets.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nProgramming and Design\r\n<p>Derwent Ready</p>\r\nTextures\r\n<p>Kenney - CC0</p>\n<p>Derwent Ready<br/></p>\r\nFonts\r\n<p>Kenney Bold - Kenney - CC0</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Gods of Trance - https://opengameart.org/content/gods-of-trance - northivanastan - CC0<br/></p>\r\nSound Effects\r\n<p>Impact - https://opengameart.org/content/punch - CC0</p>\n<p>Car Horn - https://freesound.org/people/MicktheMicGuy/sounds/434878/ - mickthemicguy - CC0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T05:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a6c6802365ef5bb9abf1d466034b8c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
