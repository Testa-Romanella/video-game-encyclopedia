The first step is to take out all the mutated threats before starting the restoration process and that's where you come in.</p>\n\n<p>What type of game is this?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is a round based survival game, spawn in as a soldier with your trusty weaponized arms and take to the surface ready to start cleaning up the Earth of it's mutated threats one kill at a time. Find power ups, unlock new abilities, come across interesting enemies, and fight bigger and bigger hoards of enemies.</p>\n<p>Is this game completed?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is still in it's early development, but work is being done by me daily to get it to a place I can call it finished. With the feedback I get from you and other players I will be able to make a fun full experience where you can mess around and kill a few hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What are some future plans for the game?</p>\n<p>- Add more enemy types</p>\n<p>- Add more abilities and upgrades</p>\n<p>- create more game modes</p>\n<p>-\u00a0\u00a0Improve combat and movement</p>\n<p>- Add more sound effects</p>\n<p>Anything more we should know?</p>\n<p>This is my first game where I have tried to create my own animations and everyday I am slowly improving, not all the animations were made by me but the main ones that are from the player are mostly me. This shouldn't matter much but if you notice any weird funky parts in an animation, I notice it too and am trying to improve and hopefully my improvement will be seen as this game gets updated more and more over time and with your support.</p><p>Shooter Controls:\u00a0</p><p>R\u00a0 - Reload</p><p>E - Air Strike</p><p>F - Melee</p><p>X - Highlight Enemies</p><p>Mechanical Solider Controls:</p><p>E - Dive</p><p>Left Click - Basic Melee</p><p>Right Click - AOE Laser\u00a0</p><p>R - Robot Ally</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73e25591dcf1ca120380006a3fb0c29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mango Bunny Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
