The premise of the game is to play as a quadruped protagonist who inherits elemental abilities in order to interact with the environment in unique ways, solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. What you're playing now is a demo version of the concept, with a complete level featuring the elemental power of water. Thank you for playing, and enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e55cb1239417f128222b5cbd2e1c7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JamesKav"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
