Stars Align is a puzzle game that combines the core concepts of a sokoban game and a laser puzzle to make a one-of-a-kind experience with 50+ levels!</p>\n<p>Use the boxes to build a constellation, and head to the flag once all the stars align! Just make sure you dont block your way with those lasers...<br/></p>\n<p>Along the way you'll encounter different boxes that give you new ways to form constellations, and it's up to you to learn how these boxes work and how they can help you get the job done!<br/></p>\n<p>This is an in-development project. Every level is unlocked by default so in case something happens you can skip to whichever level you like. They each are labelled with a letter or set of letters to indicate what certain gimmicks they contain. In some of the latter puzzles there are a couple ideas\u00a0that I have yet to fully explore with more puzzles, but I plan on remedying that. Any and all\u00a0feedback along the way is welcome and\u00a0greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T06:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/130/1302888923095e8d6080c3df342fe827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarioMak967"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
