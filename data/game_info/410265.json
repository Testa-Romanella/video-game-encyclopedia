For this one, I wanted to work with Sam \"Smae\" LeBlanc (@Smaezorz on Twitter) again. For the theme of \"Repair\", we decided to do a paper theme, where the level is made of sketches. The character, Crafty Fox, can fire a glue gun to trap Crocodile Scissors, and they use tape to fix the Origami Crane.<br/><br/>I have been learning the Godot Engine recently, and wanted to use it for this game jam. I have used Unity Engine for a long time; from dabbling in it in early high school, to just a couple months ago. However, I saw the potential Godot had, and I wanted to invest my time and effort in a new, growing technology, especially one with open-source in mind.</p>\n<p>Global Game Jam Page: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/crafty-fox-6<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a1c2a1f4b5ea2b6c848b8ed44eaf47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Albin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
