But it is still in development!<br/>The goal is to reach the end of the level and complete the game.</p>\n<p>Main control:<br/>The character runs automatically.<br/>If you click then you jump,<br/>if you click while stuck to a wall, then you perform a wall jump, plus you'll change direction.<br/>Mind the spikes.</p>\n<p>The blue stuffs are revive portals, if you go through one, it activates and deactivates the previous active one. So you will always revive at the latest activated portal. (If you go back to the start point then there :P ). Plus you can revive only once in one run.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, there are two zones in the game which alters the characters move.<br/>One makes it so that when you jump from a wall, you only jump away from it, not up.<br/>The other acts as ice on the walls, you slide down with gravity.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions and ideas are welcomed, thank you again for playing my game. Plus if you want you can post your death amount needed to clear this level.<br/></p>\n<p>Version history:</p>\n<p>0.6 - Itch release<br/>-The game has been openly released on Itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56559f69187323e5f251058fc486057.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SND Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
