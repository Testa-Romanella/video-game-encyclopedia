You panickingly shriek for the help of your friend until the\u00a0sight of them fumbling around to find a solution to the inherent friend floating in the sky to their imminent death problem...until the sight of\u00a0<em>that </em>becomes laughingly minuscule and ant-like. And so there you go.\u00a0 Ascending through the Earth's atmospheres, seemingly resistant to all the anti-human conditions. This is actually quite ravishing, aside from all the obstacles in the sky you need to finesse your way around. Who knew there'd be so much shit in the sky?\u00a0You've technically always wanted to see the world.\u00a0And technically, you have the best view of it. Hey, this sounds like a pretty good game idea.\u00a0 A very rushed version of a game that fits the theme of\u00a0unparalleled freedom whilst also meeting the sub-theme of powering up the longer you stay alive and being somewhere you're not supposed to be as you come face to face with a literal cosmic space fish.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T11:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac6/ac616beb4b0adf1156ff9078cc3bfa03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frog_Features"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
