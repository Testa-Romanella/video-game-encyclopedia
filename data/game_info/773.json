It is significantly different from other installments: here the player takes control over the bounty hunter named Stranger. He catches criminals and gets rewards for them. The final goal is to earn enough money for some mysterious medical operation.</p>\n<p>The player travels with Stranger to four cities: Clakkerz; Gizzard Gulch, Buzzarton, and New Yolk City. One of the features of the game is the use of &quot;live&quot; ammo: insects and small mammals. All of them have different stats and are effective against different types of enemies.</p>\n<p>The game uses two camera modes: from the first and the third person. Third-person perspective is used to solve platformer challenges while traveling long distances and in hand-to-hand combat. The game switches to the first person while using the sniper class weapons.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-22T04:56:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/546/5464304424db26e3fbc7eaa8b7748f97.jpg", "website": "http://www.oddworld.com", "rating": 3.64, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 111, "owned": 1401, "beaten": 49, "toplay": 44, "dropped": 68, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 166, "ratings_count": 120, "suggestions_count": 584, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 121, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Android", "macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Oddworld Inhabitants"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Oddworld Inhabitants"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
