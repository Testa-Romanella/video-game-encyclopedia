Painstakingly written in BASIC (and I mean that - I\u00a0haven't written in BASIC for over 25 years!) this was my entry for the\u00a0CSSCGC, and I was very proud of the result. So far this has\u00a0been the only release in the text-only series, but you never know...</p>\n\n<p>Rated\u00a018th in the comp.sys.sinclair Crap\u00a0Games Compo 2008 (CSSCGC), with the following comments:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"<em>This is certainly an artisan entry in the annals of the CGC. The\u00a0thrills and\u00a0spills of F1 racing completely neutered in the form of a text-only\u00a0boredom-athon. More than just a quick gag though, in this game each\u00a0individual track layout has been painstakingly entered into DATA\u00a0statements in the pursuit of an accurate and realistic text simulation.\u00a0I just love the use of FLASH attribute on the chequered flags on the\u00a0track selection screen. Make your way around one or two of the tracks\u00a0by all means but a quest to play every track would only be attempted by\u00a0the insane.</em>\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fa11a288ea5f30556b7aff455177c9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
