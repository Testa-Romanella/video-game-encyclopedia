{"id": 785529, "slug": "accordion-solitaire-itch", "name": "Accordion Solitaire (itch)", "name_original": "Accordion Solitaire (itch)", "description": "<p>Accordion Solitaire was the first version of solitaire I ever learned, and every since no one I know has ever heard of it. It's still my favorite version of solitaire, so I spent a weekend whipping up a version for my PC, and now everyone can play it!</p>\n<p>Accordion Solitaire rules are simple, but difficult to explain without visual aid, so have some screenshots too:</p>\n<ul><li>Play cards from your hand onto either the last stack, or the stack 3 away if they match value or suit. So in the below case, the 7 of Spades could be placed on either the 8 of Spades or the 9 of Spades, because they match suit</li><br/></ul>\n<ul><li>Stacks can be combined in a similar way to cards, the stack before or the stack 3 away if the value or suit match. In the image below, the 2 of Spades can be combined with the Jack of Spades because of the suit. Then the 2 of Clubs could be combined with the 2 of Spades because of the value. Then, the 2 of Clubs can be combined with the 2 of Diamonds because of the value.</li><br/><br/><br/>\n<p>The special rule allows you to move a stack to the back of the accordion. So taking the above example, any stack can be moved but I took the King of Spades and put it at the end so there are some great moves that can be made with all the stacks from 6 of Diamonds to Ace of Diamonds.</p><br/><br/><br/>And those are the rules! This was originally supposed to be made for Ludum Dare 50 but life got in the way. It's next to impossible to win a game of Accordion Solitaire, so adding the ability to move stacks to the back was my way of \"Delaying the Inevitable\" to fit the theme.<br/></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T18:53:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e14e075c7c975719e98679b60ffc1ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Speicher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
