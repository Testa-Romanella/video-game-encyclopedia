Intelligence is primarily a character-focused RPG with enough flavor text to rival ... can't think of an able comparison! But take our word for it, there is lots of stuff you can talk to, typically it'll be a couple lines of dialogue, but sometimes characters will have full blown conversations over objects you choose to interact with.</p>Gameplay! Tell us of that!<p>Intelligence is essentially a linear RPG with a locked progression curve, so you're never really under or over-leveled for a boss. The combat is simply sideview and turn-based, but every boss has interesting mechanics, strengths, weaknesses, and twists. The game is also chock full of intense and not-so-intense minigames, and some rare bosses have timers too, adding to the intensity. Among the activities is dodging huge chunks of a meteors collision while riding a bike, free-falling down from a sky-bridge back to the surface of a city, avoiding incoming trains while running along tracks suspended in air, throwing globules of water to put out fires, stealing fish from a market without being caught, there's even more!</p><p>The majority of what you fight are bosses, but sometimes some more scrubby enemies are thrown in for good measure.<br/></p><p>Other Info bits!</p><ul><li>The game is over 8 hours long. I as the developer have a save JUST before the ending, which is 8 hours and 17 minutes. Your mileage may vary.</li><li>While it's been in development for five years, it's been on and off, sometimes receiving no updates or progress for months at a time due to working on other projects.</li><li>You do not need to have played any prior of the CCC's games to get the main gist of the plot and what's going on, if you feel motivated to check out the other games, keep an eye out, I may very well be posting them up here.</li><li>The game has a really nice fully custom OST that Jake \"MoneyMenace\" Gamelin composed, if you like it you can check it out here. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80fdacfc64ac44f25603a8b4a2215a33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bizarre Monkey"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
