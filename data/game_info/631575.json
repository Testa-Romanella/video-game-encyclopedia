{"id": 631575, "slug": "tarmac", "name": "Tarmac", "name_original": "Tarmac", "description": "<p>Tarmac is a fast-paced arcade racer that takes inspiration from some of the best racing games of the 80s. It still is in an early stage of development but I figured I can just put it out here if anyone wants to support me while I am at it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Physics</em></strong></p>\n<p>The physics in this game are modelled similarly to the driving characteristics a real F1 car would have. The cars have a very high amount of grip which enables them to corner quickly and when combined with the high amount of raw horsepower these cars have, it all results in an interesting challenge for the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>The AI</strong></em></p>\n<p>The AI still is very basic as I am currently still advancing my technical abilities as a developer. It is quite challenging which is why I recommend practicing the tracks in the Time Trial mode before facing them in a proper Grand Prix.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T06:36:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de307cf89d13fb0aee86d84821e3d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["walterfrosch"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
