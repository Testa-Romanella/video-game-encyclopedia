Once you start the game there's no talking to the player allowed, you can only communicate answers visually.\u00a0Discussing answers directly is off the cards, its a game of charades but with a twist.\u00a0Complete as many minigames as you can before time runs out! There's extra points for being fast but watch out, if you answer incorrectly you'll take a time penalty.\u00a0\u00a0Can you reach 3\u00a0Stars?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game features 6 different minigames, for each game a player is selected at random (or everybody is a player). Gain score and time by answering quickly and correctly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by</p>\n<p>JamieOutram</p>\n<p>HorjeCazador</p>\n<p>KRyder<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd9/cd971ec89de96a891952ae64eaea833f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamieOutram"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
