It means a lot!</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Fubuki:\u00a0Hell Frozen Over is a single-player shoot em' up that chronicles a sorcerer's quest to save themselves and their lover from Hell.</p><p>Do you want a calmer, slow experience where bullets daintily crawl across the screen? Or do you want intense, fast-paced action where the screen is covered with projectiles and murderous enemies? Fubuki is centered on the premise that the player should decide from themselves.</p>\n<p>New features to this build:</p>\n<ul><li>Slight rename: now called\u00a0\u706b\u6b66\u5668 and given a reading of \"fubuki\". </li><li>A high score table:\u00a0Let the opening sequence scroll by and don't press anything. Your top five runs will appear on a scoreboard.</li><li>A boss fight with four different attacking patterns.</li><li>New particle effects for the shot, hit effect, bomb, and supercharge.</li><li>The player model I\u00a0made didn't really fit in the game, so I\u00a0\"compromised\" by surgically grafting the head off the player model onto the cape model. A bit uncanny, definitely, but I guess it's a player model???</li><li>An input widget in the top right of the screen.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls (</strong>Controller support is enabled, so feel free to use one)</p>\n<p>Fubuki: Hell Frozen Over is a two button game.</p>\n<ul><li>Z / Button 0: Fire (hold down)\r\n</li><li>X /\u00a0Button 1: Bomb (use when \"BOMB OK!\" or \"SUPERCHARGE!\" is shown)</li><li>Delete: Pause game\r\n</li><li>Escape: Quit (not allowed in some menus)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every enemy you shoot down and bullet you graze (indicated by a\u00a0<em>tap!</em> sound and your character flashing bright white)\u00a0<em>increases the score multiplier.</em>\u00a0 Dying or letting the multiplier gauge reach empty will <em>result in the multiplier being reset</em>, as well as your bomb gauge being emptied, so\u00a0<em><strong>don't die</strong><strong>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Extra lives (aka extends) granted\u00a0at 100k / 250k/3mil, therefore, scoring at least somewhat OK is important for surviving, as one hit is all it takes to lose a life.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>While you can't shoot down the swords, you can use their bullets to continue your chain to the ships in the first part of the level, and (hypothetically) the robot in the second part of the level, which means<em> it is possible to\u00a0</em><strong><em>chain the entire stage</em></strong>.</li><li>Ironclads and Robots\u00a0are worth a lot of points, so try to <em>build up a multiplier by destroying\u00a0weak enemies</em>\u00a0before you shoot them down.</li><li>The crest on your cloak is roughly where your hitbox is\u00a0(it's quite small)</li><li>Your end bonus for defeating the boss is a <em>50k base that isn't affected by the multiplier</em>, however, this is raised\u00a0<strong><em>up to half a million points (!!!)\u00a0</em></strong>at 100% intensity.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T12:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b2821d95948e1180b284fe955daba351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tis2k"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
