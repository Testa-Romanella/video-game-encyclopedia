This is my submission for the GitHub GameOff 2022 Game Jam. The theme was \"cliche\" so I chose to make the cliche rookie solo indie game dev move and set out to make Tony Hawk Pro Skater with NFTs and ended up making a crappy, buggy Flippy Bird rip off. I think I succeeded in my goal and so if you are playing this and experience problems those are creative choices and features not Ls and bugs.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fa/1fa01b39e11f7e99e5707b8917b5e0e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BloopyGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
