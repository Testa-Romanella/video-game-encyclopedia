However, I never ever found the game and it seemed like it had disappeared off the face of the Earth.</p>\n<p>So I decided, despite never making a 3D game or using Unity before, I would remake this game in 3D using Unity in 3 weeks. And I just managed to accomplish that and I'm really proud of it for my first game.</p>\n<p><strong>**Here are some special screenshots**</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>You have 90 seconds to shoot down as many dinosaurs as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>**Hint**</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bigger </strong>dinosaurs give you more <strong>points.</strong></p>\n<p>Well, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T20:17:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c8/2c86a7b35a2de2a3ed6a4abf319c0527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Made1207"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
