In my time in life, I always strive to make others happy, so made a small simple game about making others happy. How does this fit the theme? Well:<br/><br/><strong>\"No-matter\u00a0what you do, you have no control how your actions impact those around you and how there reactions can affect others.\"</strong><br/><br/>Therefore during this game you can move, and use your four interaction buttons to interact with the world. You can do four different interactions:</p>\n<ul><li><em>Sing.</em></li><li><em>Talk.</em></li><li><em>Throw Money.</em></li><li><em>Give Chocolate.</em></li></ul>\n<p>You may not be able to control how others react, but you can try your hardest to make everyone happy. <strong><em>Not\u00a0everyone is possible to make happy.\u00a0</em></strong>Post your high score\u00a0(vibe in the top-left\u00a0) in the chat so we can see how well you did! I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Move:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Keyboard:</em> WASD, Arrow Keys<br/><em>Controller:</em>\u00a0DPAD, Left Stick</p>\n<p>Interaction Keys:<br/><em>Keyboard:\u00a0</em>IJKL, 8456 Numpad<br/><em>Controller:</em>\u00a0YXAB, Right\u00a0Stick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cb612e3e5a1e0efcb2877d1482b004b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fredxvi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
