We know people love the classic version of FA and still play it today and want to make sure it is accessible in a quality form.</p>\n<p>FA used to have a presence on the mobile stores but does not at the moment. This will be fixed in the near future. The older web version will remain up and free.</p>\n<p>This version of Faerie Alchemy is also built on our new engine. It will be easier for us to update and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay to Support</strong></p>\n<p>The price is $9.99 as a sustainable price. In the past we gave the game away for free, and overall it has never been close to breaking even on cost to develop in its various forms. So if you love the game and want to encourage future develop then buy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>New Faerie Alchemy Development</strong></p>\n<p>When we first developed Faerie Alchemy we had a certain vision for the game, and now we will be working over time to realize that exact vision. By buying this game, you're helping to ensure this vision is realized.</p>\n<p>The 1.0 version of Faerie Alchemy is close to the classic web version while still having more quality of life improvements and higher resolution graphics. There is always more room to improve and we'll continue to iterate on polish and features.</p>\n<p>What will the extra content be? Time will tell!</p>\n<p><strong>What's New?</strong></p>\n<p>In the 1.0 version there is no major content additions besides polish and quality of life. It's still the same game, but aimed to be better. We will continue to refine the core polish before moving on to the original scope of FA to fully realize its design.</p>\n<p><strong>Faerie Alchemy History</strong></p>\n<p>We originally made Faerie Alchemy way back in 2011.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At some point\u00a0Faerie Alchemy evolved into FaeVerse Alchemy (along with FaeVerse Solitaire - which has its own descendants in games like Faerie Solitaire Harvest and Faerie Solitaire Dire) however FVA ended up costing a ton without being profitable and ended up into development hell due to various demoralization factors. FVA too still has a future as FVA reborn.\u00a0This version of FA is not replacing FVA, but when FVA Reborn is eventually fully released it will look very different from its original version. Now FA and FVA Reborn have two different destinies.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Previous Customers</strong></p>\n<p>If you have purchased a version of FA or FVA in the past send us a receipt with\u00a0proof of purchase to help@subsoap.com to get this version for free.</p>\n<p><strong>FaeVerse</strong></p>\n<p>Faerie Alchemy is part of the FaeVerse.</p>\n<p>View all FaeVerse content on its official site:\u00a0https://www.faeverse.com/</p>\n<p>Join the NEW Subsoap Newsletter at:\u00a0https://www.subsoap.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you do not want to use a Windows installer you can download the win32 zip and extract that to play.</li><li>If you are on a fresh Linux install you may need to install\u00a0libopenal1 before you can play.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T08:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759905cd3c8fae6438eeebf2d4905a21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Subsoap"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
