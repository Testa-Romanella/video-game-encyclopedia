{"id": 975734, "slug": "seqitaire", "name": "Seqitaire", "name_original": "Seqitaire", "description": "Sharpen your mental math and logic skills with this new and unique number game! Seqitaire combines math, pattern-matching, and card-draw mechanics of Solitaire to bring you a fresh gaming experience.<h3>Game Play:</h3>Add, subtract, multiply, or divide using number tiles in a tile grid to produce the specified number. Be wary of what tiles you select though, as each tile is associated with a suit: diamonds \u2666\ufe0f, clubs \u2663\ufe0f, hearts \u2665\ufe0f, spades \u2660\ufe0f, or wild. Cards drawn from a deck determine the target number and other criteria for math submissions. For example, in addition to outputting the number 2, the tiles submitted may need to be all of the hearts suit, use at least one multiplication operator, or be submitted by swiping (i.e. click and dragging to connect adjacent tiles) only. Cards become earned after submitting all of the number results for the given card. Earn all of the cards in the deck to win the game!<br/><br/>How is Seqitaire like Solitaire? Just as card stacks in Solitaire must alternate between black (\u2663\ufe0f\u2660\ufe0f) and red (\u2666\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f) suits or must be ordered in numerical sequence, certain cards in Seqitaire require selected tiles to alternate between black and red suits, or form a \"Run\" where the number tiles are consecutive when rearranged in numerical order. **Every game of Seqitaire is unique since all the tiles are generated randomly, giving the game high replay value. Like Solitaire, not every level is beatable on the first try, and your success depends partially on skill and partially on the tiles available. The tiles disappear after being used, so the challenge is to maximize points by using as many tiles as possible in number submissions, while still being able to earn all of the cards with the tiles available.<br/><br/>**<strong>NEW: </strong> Option has been added to play each level with preset tiles instead of randomly-generated tiles. The preset tiles have been designed so that each level has multiple solutions, while levels played with randomly-generated tiles are not guaranteed to be solvable. User data is saved separately for each level based on whether the random tiles option is toggled on or off, and separate Steam leaderboards apply based on this setting as well.<h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li>10 individually-crafted levels (more coming!) including 9 untimed levels and 1 timed level<br/></li><li>Submit math equations by selecting tiles in a tile grid to output the number specified by cards drawn from a deck<br/></li><li>Tiles can be selected individually or by swiping (clicking and dragging to connect adjacent tiles). Swiping earns bonus points<br/></li><li>12 unique card conditions for varied game play<br/></li><li>Single and multiple card draw from card deck (see explanation below)<br/></li><li>Partial keyboard support (selecting tiles by swiping not currently supported)</li></ul><h3>Multiple Card Draw:</h3>The multiple card draw mechanic functions similarly to the way cards are drawn from the deck in a game of Solitaire. Either 2 or 3 cards are drawn at a time and are revealed in a stacked configuration. The top-most card must be earned before the underlying cards can be earned.<br/><br/>Seqitaire is a great math game for adults looking to train their brain or children learning arithmetic. Most new players are able to learn to play Seqitaire quickly without completing the game tutorial, so do not be daunted by the appearance of complex rules. At the end of the day, Seqitaire is a fun and addictive game that can be enjoyed by both math nerds and casual gamers alike.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/672f5795e106d86df44e2a9369bd37fa.jpg", "website": "https://dccreationstudios.weebly.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DC Creation Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DC Creation Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
