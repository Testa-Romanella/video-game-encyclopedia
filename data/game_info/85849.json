Every game round involves two players, but if you have more people you can break into teams and change team every round. <br/><br/>2. The First Player secretly records a short fragment of a song a capella while the Second Player is not listening. <br/><br/>3. The Second Player listens to the recorded a cappella in reverse and tries to guess the song at once. <br/><br/>4. If the Second Player can\u2019t guess it, then he tries to repeat the reversed version by recording it fragment by fragment. <br/><br/>5. When all fragments are recorded, Second Player listens to them all together reversed back and makes his final guess! If he has repeated fragment close enough he should hear the original song. Or something very similar! <br/><br/>Check out http://inreverse.me to watch a demo video and to leave your feedback.
