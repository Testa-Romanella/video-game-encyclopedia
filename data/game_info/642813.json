And thank you for checking out Qliphot!</p>\n<p>Qliphot is an Action-Adventure RPG much like the top-down Zelda games I\u00a0grew up loving. I've added a bit a more modern, PC-based control scheme, where the character attacks and looks at your Mouse Pointer, while moving with WASD.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>A word of caution, and probably of bit of self-excusing: This project is in its very early stages. I\u00a0am a Game Designer at heart, so visual assets are mostly things I\u00a0bought in Unity's Asset store, there's no save yet,\u00a0and some sounds and graphics I\u00a0borrowed from games to illustrate. I\u00a0will work on replacing these very soon\u00a0(All games are properly credited).</p>\n<p>However, I want to hear from you: What you think about it, what you don't like, what you imagine I\u00a0could do with the systems... All feedback more than welcome!</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for playing!<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All music made by Winterquilt, a friend and extremely talented musician who encouraged me to upload this demo with his support and enthusiasm for the project!</p>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>IG<br/></p>\n<p>Bandcamp<br/></p>\n<p>Spotify</p>\n\n<p>Cover art made by Michael from LIMINAL GARDEN. Check out his art, he does some wonderful art for different albums and owns a Vaporwave label filled with great talent!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><em>PS: If you're an artist, or a programmer, and this project vibes with you, please feel free to contact me and we can talk about working on this project together! Right now, this prototype is a proof of concept, but I\u00a0want to pitch it to real publishers or maybe Kickstart it in the future!</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Email me at: sebastiancova@gmail.com</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000d16112217b2bd7e002f4ea850887d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Negimagi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
