He was defeated by a legendary warrior and sealed inside the dome of seasons, under the watch of the guardians of seasons, waiting patiently for a breach.<br />\nOver the centuries, the story became legend. Legend became myth. And the evil mage passed out of all knowledge. No one believed about the guardian\u2019s duty anymore. But for generations, in shadows, guardians of seasons continued to pass their knowledge from father to son . Sons? Well, that was before Aryelle.<br />\nAry and the secret of seasons is an adventure game where you follow the journey of Ary across the world of Valdi. As a new season\u2019s guardian, Ary has the power to navigate between seasons, summoning small spheres that act as tiny ecosystems for each season, and changing the environment within to suit her needs.<br />\nHer self-control and courage will lead Ary to where no other guardian has been before. But will that be enough to restore the seasons of Valdi?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T16:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec6d154d617a744fad963ee67fa1f1a0.jpg", "website": "https://ary-game.com/", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 72, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 147, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Fishing Cactus", "eXiin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Modus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
