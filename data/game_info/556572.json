Anyway, it should be great (when it actually works).<br/></p>\n\n<p>In a world where the balance between good and evil is strongly in favor of good, so of heaven, you will incarnate a succubus and her twin brother incubus, whom are going to make their way out of hell, purge some humans and cathedrals, and then kick some angels asses in order to re-establish a better balance between realms.</p>\n\n<p>As said before, the game revolves around its Roguelite Mechanics. Multiple runs should be needed to complete it (if I take the time to finish this project anyway).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acb89d5d98d67bab16d65eeac75979fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Abject"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
