There's a score and highscore system and the only problem with the game is it doesn't save your highscore, so what you can do is before you close the game you can write down your highscore and then close the game. Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:00:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/532ff8e4d358d342af2f121ba617fa16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Mandogelorian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
