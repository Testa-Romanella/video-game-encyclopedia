Take control of a painting cube and move in 4 possible directions, where each direction is locked to a particular color. Enter a field from a direction with a matching color to paint it and initiate special mechanics connected to it.<br/><br/>Start with simple levels consisting of 3 or 5 fields and watch as the difficulty increases as you progress through the more and more complex mechanics. Unlock new painting mechanics and carefully think about each step, as any misdirection may lead to a series of incorrectly matched paint colors.<br/><br/><h3>MOVE TO PAINT</h3>The basic gameplay starts with a simple 4-directional movement. It may sound simple, but with each step taken your cube will spread a color related to the direction taken. Analyze the game area and plan your steps ahead as a wrong decision made at a crossing may cost you a series of excessive steps to fix it.<h3>100 COLORFUL LEVELS TO COMPLETE</h3>Start your adventure with levels requiring just a couple simple steps to complete and watch as the difficulty increases with your progress. Unlock new painting mechanics - from fields painting all row when you step on them, to unlockable gates blocking your progress and teleporters that make unpacking the level's layouts even more difficult.<br/><br/><br/>Test your skills in special, challenging levels, where you're limited by move limits or take control of multiple coloring cubes at once. Will you manage to finish them all?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T08:56:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e546d8f1a1667bb63d0f4bc8e9e97fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Last Qubit"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Last Qubit"], "esrb_rating": null}
