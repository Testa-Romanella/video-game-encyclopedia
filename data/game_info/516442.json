She wanted to feed her family with delicious pumpkin soup, thus she decided to take the pumpkin home. The roots of the pumpkin were as of magically bound to the earth and even if she tried to pull with with all of her strength, the pumpkin would not budge. So she took out her pocket knife to cut the roots of the pumpkin. As soon as she burried the blade of the knife in the root, she was teleported into some dark underground maze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing that was illuminating the land was menacing head of the pumpkin monster. Evil pumpkin with ominous voice explained to Miss Pebbles that she is in his kingdom called Pumpkinland and that he is like a sun in this world, casting light on every little corner of it and without his presence everything is immersed into the darkness. Her only chance to escape, he said, is to grab the root at the end of the maze. If she fails to do so, her soul will forever remain in the Pumpkinland and it will serve as nutrition for the next pumpkin to grow on the field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, the monster said: \"Good luck finding the root at the end of the route without me illuminating it and nobody rooting for you! Muhehehehe!\" Fortunately Miss Pebbles had some super candy in her pocket that can help her with Root access to the Pumpkinland and slay the root of all evil!</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The safe route is visible once at the beginning of the game, then you need to remember.</li><li>Use arrow keys to move on the tiles and try to reach the goal.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>BUFFS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>SUGAR RUSH: Candy gives you super sight!\u00a0This is one-time-usage candy will help you to remember the path and the whole route is revealed for 2 seconds.
