In this click &amp; click adventure you will have a single button to advance in the story: a virtual routine of a content consumer who lives their day through different platforms that harvest their data.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis data will end up reflected in a garden, the Data Garden. A growing ecosystem where everything endures. A reflection of your digital self that knows more about you than yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is the debut game of the narrative studio Shaman Garage. They use the constrains of only using one button as input and no text to bring us this experimental story driven puzzle game.
