Hitogata Happa is considered one of the hardest doujin style shooters ever! \u2013 Unlike the first two games, Hiitogata Happa is a vertical scrolling upward shooter, the action in this game is a visual mish-mash of weaponry that will give your senses a total overload. Threatened by an invading army who is terrorizing the land, Rosa enlisted the magic of a witch, Kreutzer \u2013 who has charmed her own army of magic dolls, each with extreme power and crazy weapons.  Use these dolls to take revenge on the invaders as you blast through six, intense stages.
