You win if you make it to the Apocalypse stage of evolution\u2026 which is keeping a planet safe for 25 of its orbits.</p><p>If 2 planets collide they start their evolution from scratch and their orbital paths are changed, potentially destroying more worlds. If a planet collides with the Sun it is destroyed.</p><p>Best played in 2D mode but hit L-Ctrl and you'll get a first person view of your \"Small Worlds\", hopefully nothing smashes into them and you can get a glimpse.</p><p>This is more of a zen game, but I guess the win condition would be lining up all the planets in the habitable zone and keeping them all there until at least one of them reaches the maximum stage of development (25 orbits, without any collisions).</p><p>Controls: Left / Right to move / aim the solar flares. Up/Down is also in first person mode L-Shift to fire a Solar Flare</p><p>Some rudimentary sounds, but nothing special.</p><p>Source code: https://github.com/emileae/LDJam38</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03f490349afd8a7b262193c83b9b2351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Emile"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
