Players will receive talent points and various exquisite CG rewards after defeating them. Within the specified time, players need to click and eliminate enough monsters to attack enemies. After each round, the game will display the damage caused by the player, which is directly proportional to the player's attack power and the number of monsters eliminated.<br/>\r\nIn the game, players need to carefully choose whether to eliminate more monsters in the current round to accumulate higher attack power or to reserve some monsters for better damage to enemies in the next round.
