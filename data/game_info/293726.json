Most of what's left to complete is getting all of the placeholder art replaced, working on the sound design, adding music, and general polish.</p>\n<p>Buying the beta will get you access to all beta versions, and the full game once it releases, including a steam key once the game is on Steam. The beta is also at a discounted price!
