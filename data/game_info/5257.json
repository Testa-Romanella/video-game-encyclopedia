Set in the year 1939, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings follows the rogue archaeologist on an all-new globe-trotting quest. From San Francisco&#39;s Chinatown to the lush jungles of Panama, Indy must use his whip, fists and wits to fight through ruthless opposition as he spars with his nemesis, Magnus Voller, in a race for a relic of biblical proportions - the Staff of Moses. Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings features completely interactive environments, where players need to call upon their wits and daring to make each spring-loaded environment a weapon in order to dispense of foes in clever and unexpected ways. Also, embark upon thrilling action sequences that remain true to the spirit established in scenes such as Indy&#39;s pursuit of the motorcade in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine-cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the free-for-all aboard the tank in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</p>", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2009-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-30T20:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/aa1/aa1a2fde2addc1e590c0b40fb36da239.jpg", "website": "http://www.lucasarts.com/indy", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 6, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 577, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Wii", "PSP", "Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Amaze Entertainment", "Artificial Mind and Movement", "A2M"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
