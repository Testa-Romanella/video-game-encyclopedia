You can also splash your own blood but use it carefully and wisely to avoid unnecessary travels.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a one-key-feature game we create as end of year\u2019s project. We are 5 French guys enjoying video game creation. We had to choose between many topics, ours were \u00ab\u00a0Death is good\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0Limited Visibility\u00a0\u00bb. We obviously tried to combine those two topics in a way we hope you will enjoy.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Please leave us your comment and tell us what you think of our modest first game published online.\r\n  </p>\r\nDefault controls:\r\n  \r\n<p>This is a keyboard only video game. \r\n  </p>\n<p>ZQSD to move the creature.\r\n  </p>\n<p>SPACEBAR to jump.\r\n  </p>\n<p>R to splash your blood around the creature.\r\n  </p>\r\nOur team\u00a0:\r\n  \r\n<p>Jalil Marquis - Project Manager / Level Designer\r\n  </p>\n<p>Anthony Valentine - Dev / Sound Design\r\n  </p>\n<p>Victor-Elisee Lopez - Dev\r\n  </p>\n<p>Emilien Parme - 3D Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p>Valentin Bouclet - Game Design / Sound Design\r\n  </p>\r\nSpecial thanks:\r\n  \r\nS\u00e9bastien Teixeira the big fr\u00e9rot\r\n  \r\nMusic credits:\r\n  \r\n<ul><li>Menu music: Sci-Fi Royalty Free Music from Benjamin Tissot (also known as Bensound)\r\n  </li><li>Ingame Music: Unspoken by Myuu / https://soundcloud.com/myuu\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\r\n  </p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\r\n  </p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:58:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/58431de3b4de1a92df413ffce4f81fa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kenoner", "Jalil Marquis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
