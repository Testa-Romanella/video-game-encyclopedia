Although, funnily enough, in this world the gender roles have been completely reversed.\u00a0</em></strong><br/><br/>In Journey to Northpass you follow the adventures of Sevrin, the noble warrior princess from a far away land, come to travel the curious world beyond the Barrenwoods. She is guided by a mystical mage named Amaury, who is on her last of her ten good deeds to let her spirit rest in peace. And let\u2019s not forget the gorgeous, doe-eyed prince Hammett, who almost every woman in the land longs for, yet unfortunately often finds himself in positions of distress.\u00a0<br/><br/>The lands don't just belong to womankind, however, as there are a cast of colourful characters to learn about to interact with from various original races- Let alone all the hostile monsters lurking in the shadows of the woods.\u00a0<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they will all have to learn to work together to solve the case of the recent mysterious sightings- strange elementals appearing only to attack the living, destroy property and resolve unfinished business.\u00a0<br/><br/>Can Princess Sevrin save the day and get the guy before it is too late?\u00a0<br/><br/>Probably.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>---\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Journey to Northpass features, or will feature:\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00b7 Original graphics; Sprites, tilesets, and dialogue busts.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 A default but attractive-looking battle system.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 A hopefully humorous and, despite its intentions, not\u00a0<strong>too</strong>\u00a0cliche storyline. Perhaps even touching at times.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 Original characters with a female-dominated cast.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 A lot of jokes based around the absurdity of gender roles.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 Usage of a few handy scripts, such as a questlog and quest markers.\u00a0<br/>\u00b7 A royalty-free soundtrack.\u00a0<br/><br/><em>Journey to Northpass is a game with left-wing humour aimed at a specific audience. If this does not appeal to you, the game may not be your thing. Please give your criticism with the target audience in mind.</em>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a5d4ae1a5ea44abfd820b50962bf1aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chromatism Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
