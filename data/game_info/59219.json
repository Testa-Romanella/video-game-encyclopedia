The game ties together the tales of the three beloved characters with three new playable characters--Emma, Jane, and McDullen. Dungeons include plenty of new traps and monsters to foil you in your quest, but your characters have helpful abilities, ranging from the traditional (running, picking up objects, and leaping) to the stealthy (sneaking and observing), to help them through sticky situations.", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2005-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-11T07:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/476/4767a15a57976d9ccc534e76f8c0cd75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 441, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Media.Vision"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
