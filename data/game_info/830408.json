{"id": 830408, "slug": "chaos-cafe", "name": "Chaos Cafe", "name_original": "Chaos Cafe", "description": "<p>Welcome to Chaos City, the capital of the State of Chaos. Here, you can expect to sustain light casualties to your security detail (you have a private army, right?) during a normal stroll through the safest area of the country. The sound of distant gunfights and the occasional explosion fill the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are a generic worker in the Chaos Caf\u00e9, where \"There is more to living than coffee.\" You sell all sorts of goods, from radios to drinks to weapons and ammunition (mainly weapons and ammunition actually). Your customers are impatient, trigger happy, and prone to erupting in violence at the slightest inconvenience for them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find the requested order of the customer on the counter. Click on the item, and click on the customer to give it to them. If you take too long, then the customer will begin draining your health with their violent energy. In this case, you must click on the kill button and then the customer to terminate the client.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterwards, the body will be disposed of, and the next customer will proceed. Rinse and repeat as long as possible. Your shift will end upon your death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The more customers you process, the less patient the next customer will be. Your score will also increase by a larger amount for each customer. Although you may kill customers, the Chaos Caf\u00e9 higher ups would prefer it if you fulfilled your order. Your rating will go down for every customer that must be killed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck, laborer. Your body will be given a proper burial once your shift is finished, and all wages will be sent to your next of kin. If no next of kin is available, then the money will be withheld by the corporation for \"safekeeping\" until a suitable recipient is identified.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T09:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f509265abccb3c54494ca52735d5c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mailman02", "Irvin Y"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
