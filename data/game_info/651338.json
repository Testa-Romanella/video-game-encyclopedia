You'll have to make groups of two, with little room to manage. So, how do you play Tile Match Hexa? The game begins with a board full of hexa tiles with shapes drawn on them. There are a few tiles with the same shapes in each level. On the top of the screen is a space that can hold up to six tiles. Each time you tap on a tile in the puzzle, it moves to a space on the top of the screen. Whenever you match two of the same tiles in that area, they disappear, leaving room for more tiles.<br/><br/>Because space is limited, you must be careful not to tap on pieces at random. You should only tap on those that can form a group of two. Otherwise, you'll fill the board with a bunch of loose pieces that leave you with no possibility of movement.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T20:26:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed7614065a41fc169172f77bbb47ebe_Mu3bl0F.jpg", "website": "https://spearmintgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Spearmint Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["NANOCRAFT TECH LLP"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
