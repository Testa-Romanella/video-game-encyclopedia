That fire hydrant you see? It may actually be a dog or a taxi.</p>\n<p>Your focus as the player is to find ice cream sundaes by revealing the true forms of objects in the world around you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are dirty syringe needles mixed in as well. Luckily though, when you reveal an object's true form it sends out a pulse that slowly gives you hints as to what nearby objects really are.</p>\n<p>Do your best to find enough of the tasty ice cream in time and steer clear of the nasty needles. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>* Use of a controller is recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f651d49474ebe878d8b80064f570831e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kevin Whitmore"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
