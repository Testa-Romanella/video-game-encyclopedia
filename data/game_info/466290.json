In this platformer you can only see platforms when pressing CTRL.

Nonetheless, I've learned tons of stuff and had a great time participating in this game jam. :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9f61372adfcb9a20ec977deeae064be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["enzephalon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
