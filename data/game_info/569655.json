You are probably the green square in the middle of the screen.</p>\n<p><em><strong>And what am I supposed to do?</strong></em><br/>Don't you want to get to the big green puddle\u00a0on the right?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wait, how do I move now?</em></strong>Try pressing arrow keys for running and <strong>Z\u00a0</strong>key to jump. You can even perform <em>wall jumps\u00a0</em>if you want to!</p>\n<p><strong><em>What about these red things? They look so dangerous!<br/></em></strong>They are really hazardous! Little squares like you should avoid these, otherwise they'll die and respawn on the last checkpoint they visited!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Checkpoints? How do they look like?<br/></em></strong>They are very easy to identify. Short blue bits of earth and nothing else.\u00a0Beware of losing your progress! Sometimes they don't work properly (what a pesky bug!), so you should run across them several times to make sure they've done their job!</p>\n<p><strong><em>How do these blue circles work?<br/></em></strong>These big things have some superpowers! They will attract you to their center if you want them to behave this way! Just press <strong>X</strong> key to see this magic happening.</p>\n<p><strong><em>These things freak me out! They work in an incredibly strange way!</em><br/></strong>Yeah, these require some patience to overcome! Try pressing <strong>X</strong> key rapidly, otherwise you'll fly over the center and be pulled back!</p>\n<p><strong><em>I want to return to the last checkpoint!</em></strong><br/>There is a special button for this. The incredible\u00a0<strong>R</strong> key will help you!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Help me! I'm stuck inside a checkpoint!<br/></em></strong>Looks like another pesky bug is trying to make friends with you! Are you an entomologist? Anyway, try jumping out of it! If it doesn't help, feel free to press\u00a0<strong>R\u00a0</strong>button.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Why the power of blue circle's attraction varies from time to time? Is it random?<br/></em></strong>It's not random! This magic attraction power depends on your distance to the center of the circle. It works just like a slingshot!</p>\n<p>Good luck, little square!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c985b9ce527b9d1f1f1882fb6370fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Geonaut"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
