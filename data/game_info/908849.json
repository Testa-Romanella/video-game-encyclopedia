She would spend all day and night searching for food, gobbling up berries, fish, and anything else she could harvest.</p>\n<p>As the years went by, the bear became more and more ravenous. She ate all the berries in the forest, then all the fish in the rivers and streams. Next, she turned her attention to the trees, devouring every last leaf and branch.</p>\n<p>But still, the bear was not satisfied. She wanted more, and so she set her sights on bigger prey. She climbed to the top of the highest mountain and ate it all, leaving nothing behind but a barren peak.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bear's hunger knew no bounds. She looked up at the night sky and saw the planets, shimmering and inviting. Without hesitation, she began to eat them one by one, swallowing each one whole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And so it was that the bear became the Ursa Maior, the great bear of the sky, her belly filled with all the wonders of the universe she did harvest.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e8/8e8afa253b31482595aa552f8d9eb22d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zahkros", "ekaktusz", "bartalomew"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
