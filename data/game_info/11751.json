{"id": 11751, "slug": "blood-bowl-legendary-edition", "name": "Blood Bowl Legendary Edition", "name_original": "Blood Bowl Legendary Edition", "description": "<p>Blood Bowl is an ultra-violent fantasy football simulator inspired by the Warhammer universe. The game was created in 1986 as a parody of a real sport and for a long time existed in a desktop format. The primary goal of the game is to deliver the ball to the enemy&#39;s score-zone. You can do this in two ways: to run into it or give a pass. The turn lasts until the player performs an action by all the characters.</p>\n<p>The Legendary Edition includes 20 races, 11 of which appear in the game for the first time. Each race involves unique gameplay. Matches take place in the form of a crazy mix of turn-based combat and a sports simulator. Players noted the high difficulty of the game and its dependence on a successful dice roll: even the most simple move can fail due to a bad throw. In the career mode, the player is encouraged to start building his own team from scratch, buying new players, cheerleaders and additional coaches.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2010-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T18:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6b4/6b4353172a07d3c4c83fa731f7ddaee6.jpg", "website": "http://www.bloodbowl-game.com", "rating": 2.53, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 1214, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 41}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 72, "suggestions_count": 621, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 72, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyanide Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
