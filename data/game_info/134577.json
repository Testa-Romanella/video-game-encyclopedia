Simple as that.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>[Esc] - Pause</li>\n<li>[A-Z] - Take a letter</li>\n<li>[Shift] - Active Cleaner</li>\n<li>[Space] - Active Shift Mode</li>\n</ul>What is a Cleaner?<p>\r\n\tWhen a Cleaner is activated all words in the screen are taken. This means that you have the possibility to make a lot of points with one key! But be careful, this resource is very limited and its regeneration takes very long time. It's represented with a circle shape on the top-right corner.\r\n</p>What is the Shift Mode?<p>\r\n\tThe Shift Mode stops the downfall of the words for a short period of time giving you the chance to scape from a risky situation. This is an illimited resource so you can use it as many times as you want. Its regeneration takes short periods of time. It's represented with a bar on the top-middle.\r\n</p>What about Want Points?<p>\r\n\tThis points are special because it only increments but can not be decremented no matter what. To get those Want Poins you just need to take valid letters, each valid taken increments this points and <strong>when the bar is full</strong><strong> you win a specific number of lifes</strong>. It's represented with a bar on the top-left corner.\r\n</p>The Rule of Gold<p>\r\n\tNever ever mistake a letter(Type a letter which is not in the screen). Each mistake will reduce the amount of points you have accumulated so far. So is better to activate the Shift Mode than start typing random stuff!\r\n</p>We are Open-Source<p>\r\n\tFastwriter is open-source!
