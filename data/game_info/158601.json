That bat is you, Ninja Bat! Seeking vengeance for the atrocities performed upon you, your goal is to kill as many humans as possible, and to spread the super-rabies virus in your stead. <br/></p>\n<p>This game has been designed to be played on a custom arcade machine. But we have included a PC build with a control layout image. We highly recommend having the control layout open whilst playing on PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074b4f9dabfa963bd0ae6ab398dafa29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Crewdson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
