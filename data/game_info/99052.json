The nameless main character, after dying, falls in the Void but manages to not fade away in the dark and start his journey back up to Earth.</p><p>There is additional constraint however: the time to do this is limited; if our hero is unable to make it back on time he is destined to be thrown back in the Void and condemned to stay there forever.</p><p>The game plays as a usual roguelite. The player is asked to explore level after level, each of which is made of hand-crafted randomly-positioned rooms. In each room, the player must kill all the enemies to pass to the following one; in order to do this, he has to move around and shoot in all directions. </p><p>In addition to this, the game tries to elaborate on the formula by adding an additional constraint: time limit for each world. This implies that the overall gameplay is much more hectic and fast. The aim is to make the player feel challenged in a tough but fair way: he must feel the tension rising minute after minute. The game must be plug and play, so that he wants to retry playing over and over again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b1019ca458fa452e664b6746a00f4f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
