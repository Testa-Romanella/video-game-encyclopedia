The game is set in\u00a0a\u00a0retro\u00a0arcade\u00a0machine with\u00a0minimal\u00a0graphics.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game-play is inspired by the popular game \"Super Hot\", and time only moves when the player moves, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game. The yellow enemy moves will move faster or slower than the player depending on the players speed and acceleration.<br/></p>\n<p>The player must use their wits to find ways around the enemy by trapping, louring, and tricking the enemy. <br/></p>\n<p>As the player progresses through the game, the levels become increasingly difficult, with new enemy variants and level design choices.<br/></p>\n<p>The game's visuals and sound effects are minimalist, with a simple color palette but a chaotic sound-track.
