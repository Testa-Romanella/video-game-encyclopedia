We develop videogames and softwares based on real knowledge. Our goal is to create new kinds of gaming experiences that are more exciting, valuable and engaging thanks to the combination between gaming and tangential learning.<br/></p>\n<p>We believe that videogames have an unexploited potential of delivering constructive content without having to sacrifice the most important side: entertainment. We are all gamers, and grew up with games such as Age of Empires and Call of Duty that taught us many cool things about history without pretending to be educational. In such games, the real knowledge is creating value for the player and not destroying it and this is what we want to achieve as a videogame studio.\r\n  </p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:\u00a0This game is our submission to the Game Off 2019 game jam. We developed it for fun and to establish a baseline for a future concept. We would love to get to know your thoughts on the game feel!
