You earn money as a player from a percentage of the income your city residents receive.\u00a0You can only place blocks adjacent to pre-existing blocks, and blocks that are unused for 4 consecutive turns will degrade into blocks with no value. Blocks can only effect each other within a radius of about 7 grid spaces. As the game continues the rate at which the population grows will increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Purple</strong> - Town Centre, only one. Holds 8 people, has 8 jobs and provides 40 resource capacity.<br/><strong>Green</strong> - Housing, holds 1 person per grid space.<br/><strong>Blue</strong> - Workplace, provides 1 job per grid space.<br/><strong>Yellow</strong> - Resource, provides 5 other grid spaces with resources per grid space.<br/><strong>Red</strong> - Leisure, increases player money received from income in the surrounding area.</p>\n<p>You can also upgrade blocks by spending money you earn as a player.<br/><strong>Town Centre</strong> - another 8 capacity, jobs and 40 resources per upgrade.
