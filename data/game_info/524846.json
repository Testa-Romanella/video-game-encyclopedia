You can also double jump.</p>\n<p>I've decided to try a new programming language (Python)\u00a0and engine\u00a0(Pyxel Engine)\u00a0for this jam, and unfortunately I had trouble making builds for platforms other than Windows. But if you are on Windows, it's just one very small executable.</p><p><strong>Warning:\u00a0</strong>windows might scream that there's a trojan in the executable. It's a false alarm, every piece of software I used to develop the game is well known and open source (Python3, Pyinstaller, Pyxel Engine).
