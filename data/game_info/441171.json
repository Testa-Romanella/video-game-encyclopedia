It takes place 10 years after events of NES-game Duck Hunt. The main hero's dog is dead and he is driving to the old hunting places to spread its ash across fields.

Yeah, they are here to get their revenge after all this years...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T06:56:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64eb4d639bc4a209ed8519137cf6bbf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paulbeart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
