He saw Demaury first in a small role in a modernized staging of Medea. As a professional in the theatre world, he appreciates Demaury\u2019s talent. Eliott Demaury brings emotions to life effortlessly, and has a real connection to the audience. On a less professional note, as a\u2026 well, hot-blooded gay man, Lucas appreciates Eliott\u2019s attractive features, slender waist, strong arms, crooked smirk and striking eyes probably even more than his talent.</p>\n<p>When Daphn\u00e9 calls for \u201cEliott Demaury\u201d, Lucas sits up a bit straighter. He is prepared to be blinded by the trademark megawatt smile of his crush. Lucas expects a confident, self-assured man, ready to claim his stake. Instead, in walks a boyish figure, almost hunched, in jeans and sneakers, with messy hair and what looks like paint stains on his hands.</p>\n<p>It is hopelessly cute, to be honest.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Or, stage manager Lucas, competent, caffeine-addicted, and continually looking sexy in his stage black, starts working with actor Eliott, talented, timid, and trying to get Lucas out of his stage black.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T11:04:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bd02a247c627a74582578390fc9faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["beanawake"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
