With a portcullis in the front, arrow slits, and towers along the outside, enemies can\u2019t get near without being shot down. Not only that, the castle has an extra inner wall so thick, no weapons can take it down.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even with an army of 10,000 men, our murder holes could burn them all to a crisp within seconds. The two gates aren\u2019t aligned, so the enemies must run around to the second gate, all while being shot at with arrows! Our impenetrable castle will stand with even a thousand archers coming, for our walls are so big, they couldn\u2019t get close to shooting over.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T11:29:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquagis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
