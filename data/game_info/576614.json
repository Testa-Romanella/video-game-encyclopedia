In their quest to exterminate a group of demons, your party will be challenged by devious dungeons, perplexing puzzles, murderous monsters and most difficult of all: tolerating each other. You'll meet a colorful cast of bizarre bystanders along the way. Some will help you, some will kill you, some will burden you with all of their problems, and some are dogs. Many of these categories overlap. Dogs included.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Small Favors is still in active development. It is feature complete apart from the ending and post-game, so saves should be transferable to the final version without loss of progress. The current projected release\u00a0of said version is end of year 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:34:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e56f88a76c68637002c0d007e47ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Genericide"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
