Generations of unwanted criminals and degenerates lurk in the dark corners of the Necrovale.<br/><br/><br/>The Necrovale is filled with powerful relics left behind by those whose story ended in the depths. Collect these weapons, armor, shields, staffs, jewelry, totems, hats, books, and other tchotchkes as you follow in their footsteps.<br/><br/><br/>Along your journey, you will meet other prisoners.
