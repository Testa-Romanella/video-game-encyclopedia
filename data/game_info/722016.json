{"id": 722016, "slug": "coreman", "name": "COREMAN", "name_original": "COREMAN", "description": "<p>Coreman is a story of a man who survived the explosion of the Earth. As all that remains from the planet are islands and mysterious Core which somehow produces oxygen and maintains gravity on shattered pieces of continents. The game itself is an open world hack&amp;slash where you can collect many items and slay many monsters. In each playthrough, Coreman will offer you fresh set of items to collect and different monsters groups to slay. The question is if you could manage to travel through all the shattered fragments down to Earth's Core. Will you discover the truth about It's power to maintain life after the cataclysm? Or will you perish, like the others in the explosion of the Earth itself?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d86/d8610a7c2f9b0a766fe7a7a6bac4616e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["macon2"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
