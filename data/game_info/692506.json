{"id": 692506, "slug": "crewmate-rescuer", "name": "Crewmate Rescuer", "name_original": "Crewmate Rescuer", "description": "<p>Synopsis: You and your crew get attacked by aliens that manage to overpower you all and take over your ship. What they plan to do is use the ship, make it their own, and reach Earth so that they may conquer it. The aliens decide to keep you all alive to work under them but you refuse. They still decide to keep you all alive but keep you caged in separate rooms. Luckily for you, player, the alien that put you away in a room didn't notice the key card that had fallen out of its pocket. Now with a way of escape, you must traverse through the ship and save your crew. Be warned, the aliens have worked fast and have managed to turn the ship into a complete danger zone. Think you can save your crew and get to the escape ship? Let's find out.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So a couple of things. One of them being the modifications that I was not able to make to the final product. I wasn't able to include a way for the player to attack the enemy, I wasn't able to create and add any boss to the game, I wasn't able to add any in-game dialogue, I wasn't able to add a chase scene, nor was I able to add a skin changer tab. This was mainly on my part for I didn't time myself well enough nor did I take into account how much coding and designing would be required. I have looked up many tutorials on YouTube to get some assistance on how to accomplish certain tasks, but like last time, they weren't as in depth. Luckily, I did manage to add a 'Practice Level' and one extra level. I had also managed to add my own hazards such as spikes and falling platforms thanks to a bit of scripting, mainly for the platforms part. I had added my own UI Backdrop design, which I know it isn't much, but I managed to get there. Also, as mentioned before, instead of a 'Tutorial Level' it is a 'Practice Level'. The same in a way, but had I fully been able to work on it longer, I possibly could've included instructions within the level. This is why I highly recommend that you check the 'Instructions' tab.</p>\n<p>Next time, I will definitely try to do more but for now I hope you enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Creator: Devin Alexander Powell</p>\n<p>Game Engine Used: Unity</p>\n<p>Other Software Used: GIMP</p>\n<p>Created by Devin Alexander Powell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T11:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d8e7be4ead898e583b97b020dd0ae44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["KingDp_217"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
