Which includes sounds movements keys and pixels.</p>\n<p>The game Nethack was first produced in 1987 and the Nokia3310\u00a0 in 2000 both are still going today</p>\n<p>For those that have never played\u00a0NetHack is a\u00a0<strong>single-player turn based roguelike video game</strong>\u00a0originally released in 1987 with\u00a0ASCII\u00a0graphics.\u00a0\u00a0NOK-HACK attempts to improve on that a little but with the restriction of only 2 colours 12 keys and 84 by 48 resolution scaling is allowed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the game begins you select who you want to be with a number selection. Then you find yourself down in a dungeon, the idea is to get deep and deeper into the dungeon and retrieve the Amulet of Yendor and make your way back out of the dungeon.</p>\n<p>There are two other keys not mentioned in graphic help\u00a0that dont effect gameplay, F2 toggles full screen and M toggles inside the game window if you want full window frame or one with a Nokia phone. This may become an ini file setting later :)</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>blink0k -----Art and Code</p>\n<p>fubarpk-----Plan and code</p>\n<p>n00bster----The sounds\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>PS The monsters will try to get as close to you as possible sometimes that means you have to press the 5 key which is take an attack on the spot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2a9a031ae9cc398e8c347bdee74205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fubarpk"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
