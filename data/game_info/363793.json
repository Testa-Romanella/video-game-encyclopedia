{"id": 363793, "slug": "rogue-451", "name": "Rogue 451", "name_original": "Rogue 451", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Rogue 451\u00a0</strong>(working title)</p>\n<p>This is my version of the\u00a0Roguelikedev does the complete roguelike tutorial event.\u00a0I didn't deviate from the core gameplay, but focused on, graphical, interface and user experience improvements. While the game in the current state\u00a0can be quite fun to play, just like any basic roguelike is fun to play for a couple of minutes, this first version is mostly for archival purposes, and to prove I've got something to show after joining the event.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>First of all, bugs. For now, saving and loading don't work, mouse navigation isn't entirely reliable and there's a lot of other minor stuff that needs taking care of.</p>\n<p>When that's done, there's a lot more user experience improvements to make. Reducing the number of menus, reducing the amount of inputs required for performing an\u00a0action, providing helpful tooltips and making sure every action can be performed with mouse and keyboard are my first priorities. After that, it's time for the gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>451</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As you might have guessed from the name, I intend to turn the game into a roguelike immersive sim. Think a top-down procedurally generated turn based high fantasy Deus Ex. This will require a complete rework of the level generation and AI, some added systems (like lockpicking and a fantasy version of hacking) and a lot of general tweaks. I expect this to keep me occupied for the foreseeable future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/941/9412f30a8a77d21403226bc3ba12241d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brain in a Bowl"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
