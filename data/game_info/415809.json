Also, I may as well add new backgrounds, levels and a better difficulty system so the game doesn\u2019t get boring too fast. \r\n  </p>\n<p>Known bugs:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Home buttons and status bar still visible;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Collision polygons in some of the meteors causes the character not to jump after given command, getting stuck and finally moving after a second touch on the screen;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- While in the game layout, if the background music is turned off and on again, causes it to get a bit louder.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7e/e7e71496ab6ae6f7a6c6ce383d5019ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Juan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
