An army of adjudicators was formed to deal with a massive human attack. One of those adjudicators was Gloria, a young career soldier put in charge of her first command. For her valor in combat, her unit was given a special mission, one that, on the surface, seemed routine. But what happened on it would change her life.</p><p>The Seeds We Planted is a short \"dating sim\" style experience based in the history of the serial story Dragon Moms. You play as a young Gloria, and work through a story with three different endings, depending on your choices. All endings are canon, but some are more canon than others.</p><p>Content Warnings: This story contains some descriptions of violence between humans and dragons. One route also contains images of sexual assault. No rape occurs, but if you're sensitive to such things, you may want to avoid that route.</p><p>You can download the game for Windows below, or play it in your browser above. Simply click or press space bar to advance. Auto will progress the text for you, and Skip will zoom forward until the next choice. If you need to cancel either of these, just click anywhere on the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["poetfox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
