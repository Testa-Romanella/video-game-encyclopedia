Cuz honestly Hobbling around isn't catching that fast rabbit and besides your precious life fluids only last so long, also Game is over if you rip the game off of Exp too many times, the game is lenient but c'mon you know also btw, jail times are insanity if caught.</p>\n<p>Praying gets you actions at the \"HUGE\" expense of Exp</p>\n<p>What to expect in jail well... 2 hours+ of wasted potential, in the Non-Demo the Jail time is only 5-10 Mins not the 2+ hour wait. Shopping gets you stats and items in Non-Demo version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b16abfa6949b3a7887e98c463117748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarainia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
