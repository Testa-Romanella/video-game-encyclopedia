{"id": 959870, "slug": "formula-top", "name": "Formula TOP", "name_original": "Formula TOP", "description": "Formula TOP brings all the excitement of formula racing to a 3D top-down racing game. Choose your team, plan the perfect pit strategy around changing weather conditions and race to victory.<br/><br/><h3>Feel the traction</h3>Formula cars are the greatest racing cars in the world with amazing speed, downforce and grip. The game's driving model is built to emphasize this so you really feel you are racing a formula car and not just any car with a formula skin slapped on.<br/><br/>Time Trial will have you chasing the perfect lap for hours as hitting that apex just right really makes a difference. Slipstream overtakes and intense side-by-side battles create a great race experience.<h3>Pit strategy</h3>Optimize risk in your tire strategy on different tracks and temperatures to maximize grip throughout the race. Push to gain positions with your fresh soft tires or try to hold your ground long enough with hard tires to take advantage of the extra durability.<h3>Dynamic weather</h3>Dynamic weather adds a whole other dimension to strategy. Do you start with wet tires on clear weather to get ready for the coming rain or leave those who do in the dust with soft tires? Or maybe you will do a longer stint with intermediate tires since the rain is light and won't last long. Whatever your plan, always be ready to adjust during the race. Reacting to the strategies of others and taking risks can make underdogs into winners.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-24T03:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb17cc86ceac833c073aeac5e33d9f87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SQX Interactive"], "genres": ["Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SQX Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
