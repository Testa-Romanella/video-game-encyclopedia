At the beginning of a game, the player receives 5 cards. He must then choose those he wants to keep and those he wants to change. It is also possible to keep them all or change them. Then, the player gets new cards replacing those he did not want to keep. If his hand forms a winning combination, he wins money, according to the table of payments. Otherwise, he does not win anything.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:16:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a4529c4e89648ea2f4ff99add670beae_trmAOX6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["360diffusion"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Fabien Brun"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
