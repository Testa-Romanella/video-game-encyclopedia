Embark\". &lt;&lt; STEAM DEMO AVAILABLE<br/><br/>A thousand years later, be the first to explore a mythic ocean planet in the feature-film length episode \"I. Deploy\". Take the helm of a jett and explore a vast unknown. Skim low over waves, roar up pristine coastlines and carve through otherworldly woods. Learn to take shelter and work together with fellow jett scouts to survive encounters with local hazards and looming 'kolos' in order to establish a secure foothold for your scout unit.<br/><br/>The Far Shore's narrative heart and JETT's wild-eyed science fiction ambitions are laid bare in \"II. Investigate\" when the assembled jett scout unit gathers on Tsosi Massif to seek out the source of an interstellar siren song known as 'the hymnwave' beneath the mantle of Tor, a vast solemn cone. Story threads are introduced here, some of which are left intentionally dangling by the end of the 2021 campaign.<br/><br/>In a multi-hour segment of the experience, in the aftermath of a series of cosmic revelations, Mei and the scouts are tasked with getting familiar with an intricate, systemic open world in  \"III. Adapt\" while they explore islands beyond Tsosi Massif, to Ozu and beyond.<br/><br/>There's some significant adversity for the scouts to push through in \"IV. Persevere\" as Mei sets out alone in a desperate bid to salvage some hope to bring this story of courage, wonder and regret to its interim conclusion.<br/><br/><h3>GIVEN TIME - THE NEW 2023 CAMPAIGN - KNOWN INFO</h3><br/>Given Time takes place 3 years after the events of the original campaign's ending, as Mei arises from torpor into Ground Control, which is still in hibernation with only one other scout awake, and a weathered jett awaiting outside.<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have another JETT campaign to offer. Given Time will continue and conclude Mei's story, while progressing and resolving key story threads that were left intentionally dangling at the end of The Far Shore.\u201d said co-creator Craig D. Adams from Superbrothers A/V. \u201cThis new campaign is much more free-roaming and player-driven, we're getting more out of our distinct ecosystem-puzzling and light survival systems this time out, but not to worry, we aren't shy about having some cosmic prog rock spectacle in unexpected places.\"<br/><br/><br/><h3>CREATORS / ORG</h3><br/>JETT was created by Superbrothers A/V + Pine Scented with songs and sounds by scntfc, and it was bolstered and sharpened by JETT Squad.<br/><br/>This moonshot of a DIY videogame and universe was quietly developed principally by two people with a composer/sound designer from 2013 to 2018.
