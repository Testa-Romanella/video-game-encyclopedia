Your hints are: Give him momentum when climbing up the stairs, and try your best to stay on the obstacle course. Falling from the obstacle course results in starting over.</p><p>Note - When you jump, your starting velocity stays the same. You cannot control movement in the air. In other words, if you run up to a platform, stop, and jump ... you jump straight up and cannot move forward. You must back up and get a running start.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/3905529f89f3db7ac8a7679a4e967606.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
