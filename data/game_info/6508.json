Using an assortment of pencils, draw elements, tools, and weapons to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. <br/><br/>Draw a Stickman Epic could be compared to an adventure game, RPG, or puzzle game, but the unique drawing mechanic is unlike any game you've ever played before! From drawing a rain cloud for growing plants to drawing an axe for chopping down a gate, you control all aspects of your environment. <br/><br/>Explore diverse environments and encounter unusual creatures as you draw your way through 14 levels (plus a hidden bonus level)! With the non-linear gameplay, how you overcome one environment will determine which level you unlock next.
