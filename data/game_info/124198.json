Naturally I continued with that in my game for the One Button Jam: Destructorb. As the jam name implies, only one button is used (even for the menus): the<strong> space bar</strong>.</p><p>The goal here is to launch the ball and destroy as many objects as you can until it comes to a stop. With any luck, you will hit a fuel truck to give it another push. High scores are saved for each level (of which there are three), so see if you can set a new record (extra special props if you manage to get a score above 1,000)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95a96ae60fb829b982c067372e40064b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Besus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
