I am uploading it to\u00a0demonstrate my current Unity skills. After completing\u00a0GameDev.tv's project taught in section two of their course \"Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D,\" I added to the game to cement my knowledge before continuing my learning journey. The following is a list of additions I made:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Imported a\u00a0<strong>custom font</strong>.<br/>\n</li><li>Added a simple <strong>menu screen</strong> with a <strong>title</strong>, start game <strong>button</strong>, quit game button, and game instructions.</li><li>Added a <strong>counter</strong> at the top of the screen, which displays how many packages are left.</li><li>Added a quit game button in the bottom left corner of the game.</li><li><strong>Changed the sprites</strong> for the boost, packages, and customer.</li><li>Added multiple packages in <strong>hidden areas</strong>\u00a0throughout the map.</li><li>Created my own <strong>unique map</strong>.</li><li><strong>Tuned</strong> the controls, colors, delays, etc. to my liking.</li><li>Added a <strong>post-game screen</strong> that displays a \"You Win!\" message with a menu button.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Adding on to the game was an educational experience.\u00a0The following is a list of important concepts I learned while implementing additions:</p>\n<ul><li>Learned how to <strong>import</strong> custom <strong>fonts</strong>.<br/>\n</li><li>Learned how to <strong>create new scenes</strong>.</li><li>Learned how to <strong>switch scenes</strong> with a button.</li><li>Learned how to create quit game functionality.</li><li>Learned how to <strong>alter text</strong> according to the value of a <strong>variable</strong>.\u00a0</li><li>Learned how to use <strong>Edge Collider 2D</strong>s.</li><li>And most importantly, learned the importance of constantly saving a game while developing it!</li></ul>\n\n<p>As this was my first venture into game development, I wanted to keep the scope small and achievable.\u00a0Taking the time to learn the proper way to implement every addition I made would be outside the scope of this small project. In the future, I plan on optimizing the game, adding new cars, and polishing the aesthetic.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Please give your feedback.\u00a0Thank you!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:51:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f29/f294709d32ba7e1295cb461a64298357.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["aboutalebdev"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
