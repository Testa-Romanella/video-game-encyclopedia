This is only available for Android 4.0 and above and sadly has\u00a0ads in it. \u00a0If you don't like ads, just turn the game off before 5 deaths or disable your internets. I don't have access to the project anymore, so I can't get rid of it. It was on GooglePlay, but they deleted it because it has ads and no privacy policy. This was sitting in the GooglePlay settings, and I just downloaded it from it. Sorry it is not good, but hopefully you'll like the\u00a0\u00a0sequel better!</p>\n<p>This contains ads, achievements, and a leaderboard (GooglePlay services still work!)</p>\n<p>Made in Unity 5. I\u00a0did: the design,\u00a0programming, UI, and\u00a0simple enemy AI. I didn't do the sounds.</p>\n\n<p>Will not be worked on anymore.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T06:01:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d53d1714da5086f9bcfee31a625f5c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["drw"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
