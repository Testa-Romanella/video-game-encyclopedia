The bees collect and bring them to the factory. The factory transforms cabbages into coleslaw salads. Improve your factory and bees to some crazy speeds. Will you be able to find a lion? ;) \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The game runs even when you're not playing.</strong> You can even close the game and come back later to collect the work of your factory, bees and lions.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nTroubles?<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tAre you running the latest build?
