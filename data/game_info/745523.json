{"id": 745523, "slug": "cereus-journey", "name": "Cereus Journey", "name_original": "Cereus Journey", "description": "<p>\n</p>\n<p>Cereus Journey is\u00a0a 2D platformer game,\u00a0in which you follow\u00a0a cactus named Cereus,\u00a0who is being\u00a0trapped inside an\u00a0 imaginary fantasy\u00a0\u00a0world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Can the cactus\u00a0escape from it?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>But\u00a0<em>who\u00a0</em>or\u00a0<em>what</em>\u00a0is CEREUS?</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Cereus\u00a0</strong>is\u00a0 a genus type of\u00a0 a cacti plant. It can actually be pronounced in different ways. We chose to pronounce its name as \"<em>serious</em>\".\u00a0 Because the cactus is on\u00a0<em>\u00a0quite a serious journey</em>, to be honest.\r\n</p>\n<p>We do not want to give the cactus a certain gender. It is gender neutral. So everybody can play the cactus, without feeling excluded. For this reason, we ended up putting a pot on top. HEHE :)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>And...WHO ARE WE?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are LSMPD GAMES . The idea of our name was quite simple. We just added all of our beginning letters together. We switched them around until it sounded nice. LSMPD sounded quite fresh and cool. Kind of like we\u00b4re this super cool Police Department Squad\u00a0 (Because of the PD on the ending, LOL).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But why did we choose a fox as our logo?\u00a0 First of all, 4 of our 5\u00a0teammates currently live in Berlin, Germany.\u00a0And if you know, you know. Berlin has had a tremendous growth of fox pupoulation since the 1950s. So even by daytime you might be able to see a fox running around.\u00a0 Also many of our teammates kind of feel like the fox would be\u00a0 one of their favorite animals. They\u00b4re just something special.\r\n</p>\n<p>So yeah this is us.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>L</strong>isa Bretillon -\u00a0 Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong>ophie Capers -\u00a0 \u00a0Artist\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong>ikel Weber - Game Designer\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong>ascal Kruse - Artist\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>D</strong>uc Hoang - Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Welp, we know.
