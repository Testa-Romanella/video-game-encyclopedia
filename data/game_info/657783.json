Try to come in under budget!</p>\n<p>It should be noted that while the game's full title is SimSewer 2027, I\u00a0do not have copyrights to the Sim(s) franchise\u00a0or the year 2027.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8df/8dfce5ef32103aebda822c1ecb2b66e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt Mrazik"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
