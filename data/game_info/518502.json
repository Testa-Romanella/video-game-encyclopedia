The single mechanic is gathering recycled material and spending it to either plant a tree or fight off enemies. This recycled material comes from the houses of the Humans who have started to invade your forest. Guide your little treant through 5 levels and bring the forest Back to Nature!</p>\n<p>All the art assets were entirely created from the provided art kit, but primarily the micro-roguelike pack by Kenney. All the SFX and music from the game were taken from the kit as well. Most of the sound effects didn't tickle my fancy, but I was able to make due.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T07:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d693d656d563b146998ccda35a6823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zestylimez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
