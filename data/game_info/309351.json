Considering we had to include TSA into the game we decided to make every NPC have some sort of question-related to TSA. An example would be \u201cWhat does TSA stand for?\u201d or \u201cWhen was TSA created?\u201d, simple questions like that. Our main audience would be anyone interested in TSA, and a E-Rated audience. Our story-line is also quite simple. As the main character, your goal is to head to Hampten, Virginia and take on each member of office in TSA. Starting with the \u201cSergeant-at-Arms\u201d \u00a0going to the President. Each gives an explanation of their role in TSA. Then you battle until someone wins, or the other person runs out of Pok\u00e9mon. If all of your Pok\u00e9mon faint there is a teleportation pad that takes you to a Pok\u00e9mon Center (which heals your Pok\u00e9mon back up to full health.) Once you are fully healed and ready for battle, you can head back to the Technosphere Tower and take on the officers once again. If you do successfully beat them you\u2019ll get a Badge and a TM (The TMs will help you progress through each battle making you stronger.) After beating the President you will get the final Badge and final TM, and then the end credits will play. That being your indication to beating the game, and getting fame and glory for all of eternity (in Hampten, Virginia of course.)</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed Explanation </strong></p>\n<p>Initially, the game starts out with you being greeted by Professor Oak. Just like the classic pokemon we grew up with, he explains Pok\u00e9mon and their role in the world. He then gives you the option to ask about the controls or adventure. Either option will give you a detailed description of how to play. Next, he asks you if you are a boy or girl and you enter your name. After this sequence, you spawn inside your bedroom and are greeted with the words: Welcome to <em>Video Game Design 2019. </em>When you take the stairs down from your room, you enter the living room. Here you\u2019ll receive your first 6 pokemon and be met by the first TSA trivia. After exiting the house, You are taken to the main town, Lappet Town, and take the road to reach route one. You will also have an option here to go into each building to interact with their NPCs who will ask you about TSA. In this route, you find path alone with a house. The house contains people who ask you questions on TSA, and the path contains a surprise Pok\u00e9mon Battle. When you reach the end of the path, you are met with the aptly misspelled Hampten, Virginia. At the end of the path, you meet an NPC who direct you to <em>The Technosphere Tower. </em>In the same fashion as earlier, you will also have an option here to go into each building to interact with their NPCs who will ask you about TSA. If you choose to go straight to the tower, you meet members of the national TSA office starting with the \u201cSergeant-At-Arms\u201d and goes up to the \u201cPresident\u201d. Each floor is a level and since there are 5 floors we meet the requirement for three levels. When you get to a floor you click one of the interacting keys to fight with the leader. Then, each gives a description of their role in TSA before the battle. After the battle, you receive a TM along with a badge. In each level, we\u2019ve also included a teleportation pad that takes you to the Pokemon center. Once you reach the President and beat him, you receive the final Gym Badge and the end credits start playing. The end credits give credit to everyone who helped with the game and also mentions that we don\u2019t need permission letters (because we purchased the platform and the starter kit was copyright free.) We also give credit to Nintendo and the people who made the starter kit in the end credits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plan of Work Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date</strong></p><p><strong>Task</strong></p><p><strong>Time Involved</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Member(s) Responsible </strong><strong>(Initials)</strong></p><p>2/28</p><p>Discussed the topic of our video game.</p><p>30 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, and KR</p><p>3/1</p><p>Agreed upon a game topic and what we would do.</p><p>20 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, and KR</p><p>3/8</p><p>Split the work amongst each other and made sure we all agreed with it. </p><p>1 hour 20 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, and KR</p><p>3/14</p><p>Started the game making process (on RPG Maker.)</p><p>2 hours 30 minutes</p><p>TM and SN</p><p>3/21</p><p>Worked on the portfolio and our game</p><p>1 hour 50 minutes</p><p>LC, RB, AA, and KR</p><p>3/25</p><p>Started to finish up the basics for the game</p><p>1 hour 30 minutes</p><p>TM and SN</p><p>4/2</p><p>Finished our rough draft for the game, and began fixing any mistakes.</p><p>2 hours </p><p>TM, SN, and RB</p><p>4/8</p><p>Fixed all mistakes and finished game</p><p>50 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, and KR</p><p>4/9</p><p>Worked on the portfolio finishing up any simple missed tasks we did not complete.</p><p>2 hours 10 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, \u00a0and KR</p><p>4/11</p><p>Finalized everything and triple checked that it was finished to our best ability.</p><p>2 hours 30 minutes</p><p>TM, SN, RB, LC, AA, \u00a0and KR</p>\n<p><strong>Members Initials</strong></p>\n<p>TM \u00a0- Talaal Maxood</p>\n<p>SN - Samuel Nixon</p>\n<p>RB - Rahul Bainsla </p>\n<p>LC - Laksh Chandra</p>\n<p>AA - Anay Abey</p>\n<p>KR - Kaushal Raju</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/083abff2c29515e1bd2fe5305eec63cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TSA"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
