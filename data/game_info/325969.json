Our interpretation of \"Connect\" was the way people connect to each other, not only romantically, but through making food for each other. As such, our game is a cross between a cooking game and a dating sim, where you perform cooking actions to determine your responses. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>This game is controlled with either WASD or the arrow keys and the space bar.</p>\n<p><strong>DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/>If playing on Windows, simply download the .zip file, extract the files, and run the Compliments from the Chef executable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>\r\nMarcus Holm (@HolmBoyQ)- Engineering, Design, Production<br/>Light Bates (@LightDiscordant)- Art, Design, Production<br/>Galen Frese - Writing<br/>Caitlin McLaughlin (@Thunder_Horns) - Art <br/></p>\n<p>\"Winter Fun\" by TeknoAXE<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong><br/>Tyler McCombs<br/>Ben Decker</p>\n<p><strong>GITHUB REPO</strong><br/>\r\nhttps://github.com/LightBates/CookingDaddy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T19:28:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b9/9b9c3d34dcc7bb6d37e95d0e2ce12d86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marcus Holm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
