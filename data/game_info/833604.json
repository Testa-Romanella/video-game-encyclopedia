From math to spelling, you'll learn a lot!\u00a0Meet Baldi's friends,\u0335along the way\u00a0\u0336\u00a0look for all the notebooks! This game doesn't just teach education, it also teaches\u00a0<strong>FUN!</strong>\n</p>\r\nThis game is not what it seems...\r\n<p>Inspired by creepy/bad edutainment games from the 90s, (Sonic's\u00a0Schoolhouse,\u00a0I.M.\u00a0Meen, 3D Dinosaur\u00a0Adventure: Save the Dinosaurs), Baldi's\u00a0Basics is a meta\u00a0horror game that's really weird, with no real educational value to be found. Collect all 7 of the notebooks and escape the school, all while avoiding Baldi.\u00a0Baldi has many friends in the school that will slow down your progress and put you at risk of being caught, so learn how each character works and how you can avoid their attention. Find and use items to your advantage. Oh, and finally, try not to get the quiz answers wrong...\u00a0Each wrong answer makes Baldi angrier...\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use\u00a0the WASD keys to move, and the mouse to turn.\u00a0Left click to open doors and pick up items, right click to use the currently selected item, and scroll wheel to change the currently selected item.
