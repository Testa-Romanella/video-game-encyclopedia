I  just added a tutorial and polished the code and the folder structure a  bit. <br/></p>\r\nCheck out the repository on Github!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T14:32:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f03c1be2b94dc4daadca319ecf5b6be4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Tarquiscani"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
