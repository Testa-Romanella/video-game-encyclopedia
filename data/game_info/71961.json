It is played with a standard set of 52 playing cards and is closely related to other trick-taking games like Spades and Euchre.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score the least amount of points. You earn points for every heart you take and if you are unlucky enough to get the Queen of Spades then you are stuck with an extra 13 points. In the default game mode in Simple Hearts, the game ends when someone reaches 50 points. However, that can be changed to 100 points, 150 points or it can be set to end after 1, 3 or 5 rounds of play.<br/><br/>HEARTS TERMINOLOGY<br/><br/>\u2022 Breaking Hearts: Hearts cannot lead a trick until a Heart has been discarded on a trick<br/>\u2022 Discarding Cards: Players can discard any card if they are unable to play a card of the led suit<br/>\u2022 First Trick: All penalty cards cannot be played on the first trick. This includes Hearts and the Queen of Spades <br/>\u2022 Following Suit: Players must follow the suit of the first card played in each trick, if possible<br/>\u2022 Hand: The cards held by one player<br/>\u2022 Passing: Before each round, each player will pass three cards to another player. The direction of the cards passed will change each round<br/>\u2022 Penalty Cards: Hearts are worth 1 point and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points<br/>\u2022 Shooting The Moon: When a player collects all Hearts and the Queen of Spades in a single round, they instead score zero and each opponent scores 26 points<br/>\u2022 Trick: One card played from each player forms the trick<br/>\u2022 Trick Winner: The player with the highest value card of the led suit collects each trick<br/>\u2022 Voiding a Suit: When a player no longer has any cards of a specific suit, that suit is considered voided. This allows the player to play cards of other suits when that suit is led<br/><br/>TIPS<br/><br/>\u2022 Be careful when passing cards. You may help an opponent who is trying to shoot the moon if you pass all high ranking cards<br/>\u2022 Keep track of cards that have been played! There are 13 cards of each suit in the deck. Play around the cards you know are remaining in the deck<br/>\u2022 Voiding a suit (getting rid of all cards of a specific suit in your hand) is a great way to play your penalty cards on opponents<br/><br/>SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK<br/><br/>If you have any technical problems, please email us directly at uv-support@magmic.com. <br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>FAN PAGES<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook!<br/>www.twitter.com/magmic<br/>www.facebook.com/magmic", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T00:38:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27d/27d76cd7913d831308a7373b05b12121_2WP34ht.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Magmic"], "genres": ["Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Magmic"], "esrb_rating": null}
