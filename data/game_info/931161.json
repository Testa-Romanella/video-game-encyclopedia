{"id": 931161, "slug": "the-no-name-project", "name": "The No-Name Project", "name_original": "The No-Name Project", "description": "When I started creating this game, I asked myself, \"What do I want to create?\" and the answer was, \"Freedom!\"<br/><br/>Welcome to \"The No-Name Project,\" where anything goes! Choose from 16 different character designs, with more on the way. In this game, you're free to adopt animals such as cows and cats, dogs and pigs, a mysterious bird, some dead monkeys, literally any NPC that you kill (if you learn necromancy), and even some weird dinosaurs that you have to revive yourself in your conquered castle (that you also have to conquer all by yourself) to help you on your journey. But that's just the beginning. With the power of necromancy, you can resurrect people from the graves you find throughout the game. Some you may have even killed yourself. Help a family one day, and kill them the next. Dig for gold in their basement, rob their graves, and resurrect them as your zombie slaves. The choice is yours. In \"The No-Name Project,\" there are endless possibilities. Fish to your heart's content, mine for precious gems and ores, and cut down trees if you are into that. You can interact with almost anything in the wilderness, uncovering hidden secrets and lore. And the best part? \"The No-Name Project\" is updated almost twice a month with new content, so the adventure never ends.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Save villagers (or don't), help them and/or work for them (or don't), kill them (or don't), rob their graves (or don't), resurrect them via necromancy (or don't), dig in their basement for gold (or don't), kill their chickens for meat (or don't).<br/></li><li>Fish/mine/craft.<br/></li><li>Cut trees, gather flowers, gather rocks, and travel where you want.<br/></li><li>Kill a king in order to become a king?

You will find books that will explain many aspects of your character. Have a look out when you explore different islands in-game for the \"Books of the Dead\". They are a collection of books within the Codex that contain the memories and knowledge of beings inscribed by Gods. When someone reads one of these books from beginning to end, it grants them the power and knowledge of the previous user whose memories and knowledge are contained in that specific book.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T07:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/689331815859e48c77e17a1a1d9bd391.jpg", "website": "https://nnp.mindquota.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oStrangerQuota", "Florin-Marian Hera"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["MindQuota.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
