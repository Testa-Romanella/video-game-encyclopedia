To avoid frustration I tried to work out the math and logic in unity. The only problem is that I fell in love with this project and I don't want to just throw it away. I worked on this for about 48 hours and it still has a lot of funky \u201cfeatures\u201d but the core is stable and working. Usually I am quite busy with school work but I will try to update it regularly. Hope you enjoy it!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>E=Move camera forward.</p>\n<p>Q =Move camera backwards.</p>\n<p>W=Move camera up.</p>\n<p>S=Move camera down.</p>\n<p>D=Move camera left.</p>\n<p>A=Move camera right.</p>\n<p>Right mouse= button rotate camera.</p>\n<p>R=Reset camera to top down view.</p><p>1=Quick Travel to Mercury</p>\n<p>2=Quick Travel to Venus</p>\n<p>3=Quick Travel to Earth</p>\n<p>4=Quick Travel to Mars</p>\n<p>5=Quick Travel to Jupiter</p>\n<p>6=Quick Travel to Saturn</p><p>7=Quick Travel to Uranus</p>\n<p>8=Quick Travel to Neptune</p><p>9=Quick Travel to Pluto</p>\n<p>(Comparison kind of killed the asteroid belt but flying thru it is truly majestic)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c30f11be7fa9f5312ba2c7e895b8e11d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tomerla"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
