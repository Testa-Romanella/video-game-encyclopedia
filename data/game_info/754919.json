You can lose if you crash into objects on the map, or into yourself. The longer the game goes, the faster the speed becomes, and the snake is longer, so the complexity of the game grows very quickly.<h3>Game features:</h3>- high quality graphics<br/>- pleasant musical accompaniment<br/>- full immersion in the game<br/>- saved classic gameplay<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T03:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df743a078b15c5ff201f63c2f661809a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
