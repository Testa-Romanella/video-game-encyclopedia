The rest of the difficulty levels may require focused multiplayer teamwork.</p>\n<p>A level selector is also present in the main menu\u00a0 in order to either continue where you died or to see all of the current build's content, which is about 4 levels and on the last one is a boss fight.</p>\n<p>The use of the jam's theme \"<strong>Neon</strong>\"\u00a0is mainly focused on the enemies being attracted to low health, bleeding players, which spill Neon Blood as the player characters are genetically altered super soldiers. It had to have a downside to be powerful.</p>\n\n\n<p>Fun trivia:</p>\n<p>I worked alone and with GMS2 IDE version\u00a02.3.2.560.</p>\n<p>My project only got corrupted 2 times during the jam, but I powered through it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can support further games development via https://paypal.me/roikkudev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44a433c15f2bf6d2d87be74cf7792ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LakeDead"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
