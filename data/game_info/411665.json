We have <strong>2 minutes </strong>to catch as many <strong>bullet-bugs </strong>as possible before the dawn. <strong>Fireflies</strong> are attracted to bullet-bugs and help us catch them. During the day our goal is to shoot <strong>birds</strong> but keep in mind we are limited by the ammunition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are using two <strong>swarm intelligence algorithms</strong> in this game. First one is<strong> firefly algorithm</strong> that controlls fireflies. The other one is <strong>boids </strong>algorithm for birds.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Press <strong>[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]</strong>\u00a0 to throw / shoot</li><li>Hold <strong>[RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON]</strong> to zoom camera</li><li>Press <strong>[ESC]</strong> to go back to main menu</li></ul>\r\nCreated by\r\n<ul><li><strong>AI Programming</strong><ul><li>Rafa\u0142 Wasiluk</li><li>Tomasz Piekarczyk</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Game Programming</strong><ul><li>Micha\u0142 Biernat</li><li>Kamil Walig\u00f3ra</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Assets Creation</strong><ul><li>Joanna Micha\u0142ek - Digital Art / UI</li><li>Weronika Wolny - 3D Modeling\u00a0 / Animating</li><li>Anna Hosumbek - 3D Modeling (Environment) / Level Design</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><em>This game was created in three days during our own game jam :)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c7/9c75c19223b980c8f412b6dd85c97fcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["m-bt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
