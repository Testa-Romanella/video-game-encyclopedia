The game is available for play on Microsoft Windows platforms as well as Game Boy Advance. It has an ESRB rating of E for moments of mild violence and peril. Players take on the first-person view of fictional amateur sleuth Nancy Drew and must solve the mystery through interrogation of suspects, solving puzzles, and discovering clues. There are two levels of gameplay: Junior and Senior detective modes. Each mode offers a different difficulty level of puzzles and hints, but none of these changes affect the actual plot of the game. The game is loosely based on a book entitled The Message in the Haunted Mansion (1995).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T23:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/5691902a8ff89ae8e1d747b62b363433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "PC"], "developers": ["HeR Interactive", "Handheld Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["DreamCatcher Interactive", "DreamCatcher"], "esrb_rating": null}
