You still need to defeat all enemies, but you can pick where to go. Still uses boss enemies, some now with minions.</p>\n<p>3) I created a final level in a smaller room with a giant boss with two supporting miniboss enemies. The final boss has a significant amount of health. This makes it take time to defeat him.</p>\n<p>Created By: Maximus McCulloch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4e0037bb10f6887cf1455429e7f9be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["mccul200"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
