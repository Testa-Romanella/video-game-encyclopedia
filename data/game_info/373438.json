History changes depending on how you play the game, from little cosmetic details to entire separate branches of history with their own unique minigames. After six ten-second minigames, you'll be shown an ending that tells you what your version of the future is like.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It only takes 1 minute to decide the world's fate... Will you create a utopia? A barren wasteland? Or perhaps a world inhabited entirely by cats?\u00a0 It's your choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/075/075e728bf635913f76e4d69dcdb977bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HitlersaurusChrist"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
