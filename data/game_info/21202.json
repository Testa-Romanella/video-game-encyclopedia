You draw your soldiers from local towns, then, through hard-won battlefield experience, transform them into fighting men \u2014 scouts, cavalry, rangers, and riflemen. Between battles you'll invest in local towns, so they can serve as field hospitals, stables and munitions caches, helping to keep your forces fit and able to fight, and so that they remain confident and supportive of your ongoing efforts and willingly supply men to fight for your cause - and as the war rages on this becomes increasingly challenging. </p>\n<p>Throughout the campaign your progress is tracked, with a full report of your accomplishments provided at its completion.
