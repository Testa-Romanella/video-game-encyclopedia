{"id": 876479, "slug": "bitter-belief", "name": "Bitter Belief", "name_original": "Bitter Belief", "description": "Bitter Belief takes the player in the guise of young Elizabeth, to experience a story of twists, through unknown lands, where the objective is to find three magic stones to release her exorcist father, from the spiritual world, after he appeared to her while she was visiting her tomb and told him that he is not dead, but is imprisoned.<br/><br/><br/>Elizabeth will gain powers depending on her journey, and this will dictate her evolution. When attacking, she will gain a form of fireball with lightning. Attacking enemies is done with just one click, but if you hold down the attack key/button, you can leave the time in slow motion for a few seconds, enough time to choose the target by the arrow, give up the attack, or even use this mechanic to escape from colliding with some danger, thus choosing to attack the nearest enemy.<br/><br/>- Cute and animated graphics<br/>- Good gameplay: Possibility to slow down time, simple commands to adapt<br/>- Difficulties scattered across the map, almost randomly<br/>- 3 stages and 20+ levels<br/>- Engaging story.<br/>- Levels and difficulties that will require you to pay more attention to all the details, so that you don't learn by dying.<br/>- Fight with the final boss, which proves to be difficult, as you will only have 3 lives.<br/><br/>Team message.<br/>The game is made by a young man of 23 years, who since he was little always wanted to develop his own game, after spending a lot of his childhood and adolescence playing NES, SEGA MEGA DRIVE, AND PlayStation. Always liked platform games. And then in 2016 he met someone who introduced him to this world, even though he didn't have a computer. A year later he got one from his father, and applied himself in the 3D world, the first projects didn't even reach the middle because the other members of the group he was part of, didn't apply. But he kept persisting, until in 2020 he decided, with the lack of financial resources, to use templates to help him understand the engine more and shorten the development time, because he was growing and didn't even have a source of income. , and knew he could gain something from what he loves to do. So, in September 2022 he finally manages to finish a project, which is this, the Bitter Belief. So he called two more friends, one who lives in France, to help him with the distribution on Steam, and another to help him fill out the game's page and make the Build with a minimum margin of errors. So, we hope you enjoy and enjoy our game a lot, and are free to criticize as long as there is respect.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T03:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e1491f2dca5f1d331c474a90c4e78623.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOGS ARE NOT SAINTS"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DOGS ARE NOT SAINTS"], "esrb_rating": null}
