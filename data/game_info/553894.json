In this unit of Create with Code I had to program\u00a0a controllable truck on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. It was a simple prototype to introduce me to physics, movement and player control in Unity.\u00a0In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, I learnt how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming; calling basic functions, then declaring and tweaking new variables to modify the results of those functions.</p>\n<p>After completing this unit, I am now able to:</p>\n<ul><li>Move game objects through programming</li><li>Apply physics to game objects through rigidbodys and colliders</li><li>Implement a\u00a0simple player controller</li><li>Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected.</li><li>Choose and correctly implement appropriate data types.</li><li>Prototype new concepts.</li><li>Comprehend and evaluate basic code</li><li>Use an IDE to modify simple code.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da05c74a2a45c9d20b0cfb22f2f5d8ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lewis Stephens"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
