The analysis aims to determine the real reason why a country faces the widespread spread of covid19 in the second wave of covid19, and create a new game to let everyone know the real situation by playing the game, so as to understand the actual method of prevention. Reduce COVID-19 infections in the country. Everyone wears a mask in a public place and tests everyone who has been in contact with covid19 patients can reduce covid19 infection. Therefore, the new game is to let everyone know the importance of these two prevention methods. In the game, if you use the M key (everyone wears a mask in a public place strategy), you can easily win the game. In addition, you need to find all the silent carriers before you can win the game and enter the next level. The purpose is to let everyone know that in order to prevent the subsequent covid19 wave from any serious infection, the country must focus on finding all silent carriers like China. The game will show how the second covid19 wave happened in different countries, with L1 representing China and South Korea, L2 and L3 representing Taiwan, Hong Kong, L4 representing the United States, United Kingdom, Italy and other countries. Wrong prevention strategies are responsible for the higher rate of covid-19 infection in the second wave of covid-19 in some countries, where asymptomatic carriers (silent carriers) are not tested and isolated, resulting in accumulation many silent carriers . These silent carriers caused a high degree of infection in these countries in the second wave of covid-19. The WHO says that before any country lifts the lockdowns, the disease transmission must be controlled. For countries with non-mandatory masks, the disease transmission is difficult to control because it is difficult to identify patient zero. Undetected patients zero who will continue to infect others elsewhere. A study shows that other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. In any case, if your country requires everyone to wear masks and social distancing strategies in public places, it will be a plus. In response, the World Health Organization wants everyone to stay at home and play video games. In any case, it is best to create a new game and let gamers know how to prevent covid19 infection. In addition to wearing masks, the application of other methods is also essential to prevent covid19. The game will be updated, and the game has no copyright. If someone obtains the game, it can be shared with others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/37134388aeeb5aac291277a6a249d572.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Chew"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
