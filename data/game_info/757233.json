Then the game will end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future plans</strong> - An actual win condition that leaves to more levels and possibly a permanent upgrade system.</p>\n<p>All assets were made by myself.</p>\n<p>I chose to only use 2 colors for this game on purpose for a minimalist art style. I also couldn't think of a good name for the game so for now the working title is \"I hope you like pink.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d9571286a65974d7a5fc5ca81d4d70f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
