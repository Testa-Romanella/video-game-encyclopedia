{"id": 428052, "slug": "sakura-succubus", "name": "Sakura Succubus", "name_original": "Sakura Succubus", "description": "<p>Ogasawara Hiroki is a thoroughly average man. A photographer by trade, he works long and demanding hours every day, all the while overseen by his tyrannical boss.<br />\nLiving in the middle of Tokyo on a paltry salary, Hiroki resides in a small, run-down apartment, and eats instant noodles to survive.<br />\nHis life can hardly be called \u2018glamorous\u2019\u2026<br />\nUntil one day, that is, when he\u2019s tasked with taking photos of Japan\u2019s top idol, Ikue Ayu.<br />\nOne thing leads to another, and Hiroki soon finds himself at the mercy of three beautiful women \u2013 all of them celebrities. There\u2019s the cute idol Ayu, the sultry businesswoman Marina, and the airheaded social media star Cosmos. They\u2019re all rich, famous, and extremely well-endowed, and they should be utterly unattainable\u2026<br />\nBut, for some reason, they\u2019re insatiably attracted to Hiroki!<br />\nAccording to Marina, these three women are all succubi, and they find Hiroki\u2019s scent intoxicating. They can\u2019t get enough of him \u2013 and soon, Hiroki\u2019s average life becomes anything but.<br />\nAyu is a super famous idol whose name is known across Japan. She\u2019s revered for her cute stage persona and her seemingly humble nature. During her concerts, she never fails to thank her fans, and her enthusiasm is contagious!<br />\n...That\u2019s just how it appears, however. Deep down, Ayu is a scheming vixen who regards her fans as mere stepping stones, and values money above all else. She\u2019s so avaricious, she claims to be \u2018moneysexual\u2019, and she spurns the advances of men\u2026<br />\nAt least, she did, until she met Hiroki.<br />\nMarina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns a well-known clothing company. Though she\u2019s only thirty-one, she\u2019s one of the richest women in Japan, and she\u2019s respected by men and woman more than twice her age.<br />\nMarina is a coolly confident beauty. She isn\u2019t the sort to fluster easily, and she has no qualms about taking whatever she wants. She\u2019s domineering, with a sadistic streak, but she has a motherly side, and she\u2019s good at dispensing advice.<br />\nCosmos is a popular social media star, with over three million followers on RapidPound. Cosmos shot to stardom after posting a series of semi-nude photos of herself online, which went viral. Since then, she\u2019s been revered as the sexiest, most daring RapidPounder of all time.<br />\nThough Cosmos dresses and acts in a provocative manner, this isn\u2019t entirely intentional. At heart, she\u2019s a na\u00efve girl, with no genuine understanding of the effect her half-naked body elicits in the opposite (and, in some cases, same) sex. This often gets her in trouble, though she can\u2019t fathom why.<br />\nCosmos is known for lewd photos, but she\u2019s a sweetheart who believes in true love. She dreams of one day meeting a handsome prince who\u2019ll sweep her off her feet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T16:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/39f/39fd46ac33ae2bd31b02e10af0abb065.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.88, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 118, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 74, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 540, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
