The objective is survive going up to the river as much as possible, trying to get the max score. To move you just have to press one of the buttons to move the carp to that direction. The game ends when you get hit 3 times by the obstacles.<br/><br/>The project was left unfinished, leaving behind some ideas like power ups and more enemies, apart of stages and skins for the carp.<br/></p>\n<p>If you don't want to download the apk to play the game, you can play it on the website, using the mouse if you are on a PC.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Made by:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Programmers : Gabriel Laguna\u00a0(lagpu1) &amp; Michael O'reilly</li><li>Artist: Eva Lopez</li><li>Designers: Jorge Monedero\u00a0(Shen_Dev)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1998eda96f4e2d2318d4085f3877a48e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lagpu", "I am Shen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
