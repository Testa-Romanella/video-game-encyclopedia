But, it can be surprisingly fun in areas, and definitely provides a challenge!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSo what is it?\r\n<p>Magicka Arena is a first person shooter revolving around shooting these magic spells than can cause all sorts of effects. You run around an arena defeating different enemy types.\r\n</p>\r\nGame Modes\r\n<p>There are two basic game modes\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Survival:\u00a0This game mode requires you to survive for as long as possible against the waves of enemies\r\n</li><li>Hunter:\u00a0This game mode revolves around you defeating as many enemies as possible within the limited time.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nSpell Types\r\n<p>There are a bunch of fun lil spells you can have fun playing around with.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fire:\u00a0This spell will cause repeat damage to an enemy\r\n</li><li>Ice:\u00a0Hitting an enemy with this spell causes an ice patch to be made. Moving in this ice patch makes you move faster\r\n</li><li>Grass:\u00a0Hitting an enemy with this spell restores some health\r\n</li><li>Thunder\u00a0Hitting an enemy with this spell restores some mana\r\n</li><li>Wind:\u00a0This spell knocks enemies backwards\r\n</li><li>Rock:\u00a0Killing an enemy with this spell will generate a shield that allows you to absorb one hit\r\n</li><li>Light:\u00a0Killing an enemy with this spell restores all of your mana and health\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>(Pro tip: Hit with the fire spell twice then hit with the light spell. The burn damage will kill the enemy and the since the light spell is the last thing you hit them with, all of your mana and health will be restored!).\r\n</p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>There are three main enemies as well.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Tank:\u00a0Big, slow, loads of health and deal loads of damage. You have to be close to them for them to be a threat however. They are also very predictable\r\n</li><li>Chaser:\u00a0Fast, nimble and aggressive. These guys will hunt you down and deal damage as soon as they touch you. Be sure to get rid of them quick!\r\n</li><li>Shooter:\u00a0These enemies have more brain than the other two. They keep their distance and fire shots, they dont do much damage but are should not be ignored.\r\n</li></ul>\r\nExtras\r\n<p>As mentioned, this was my first ever Unity project, all the textures are just basic colours, there is no sound or anything and there may be a few bugs due to a lack of testing. For these reasons the game is completely free to play.\r\n</p>\n<p>Link to source files<br/></p>\n<p>Also feel free to critic, criticism is necessary for improvement!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/73140bece3a9cc0afa4cb5a3305b907c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enopa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
