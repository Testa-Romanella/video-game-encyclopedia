As well as reworked the bridge level and added a tap-to-turn-around function to the player; now you can turn in place. See comments section below for more details. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<em>STICK</em></strong> is a prototype of a simple platformer idea. The player  character uses a walking stick to poke switches and help them make  difficult jumps and avoid dangerous terrain. In this case the only  dangerous terrains are spikes and falling off the screen.  </p>\n<p>I also threw in some collectable mushrooms for good measure that add to  your score, as well as a timer that will give you a % bonus to your  score if you're quick enough.\r\n </p>\n<p>It's short, and has some occasional wonkiness which I'll be ironing  out. But I'd love to get feedback regarding how the controls feel,  especially opinions about the fact that I made the player character snap  to grid in the x dimension, which I realize is an unusual choice for a  platformer. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T04:20:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11cbc269f38bcafbcdbeb0deb26810d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElectricLemon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
