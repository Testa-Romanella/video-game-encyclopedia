The included dyno allows you to test changes made and make sure you're going the right direction! The tuning is almost unlimited - Want to run a tall first gear with a short rear? You can!

No worries - just visit the mechanic and he will reset you to a base tune.

So we've given you over 300 different modifications across the classes to keep up with the rest of the racers. Different engine blocks, intakes, valve trains, exhausts, tires, etc... As you modify your car you will have to keep up on your tune as each modification slightly changes your car's ability.
