The first Game (This Makes No Sense) probably won't be released. Since I lost the data to edit This Makes No Sense, I decided starting the sequel with different and self-made music and more/advanced gameplay and sprites than the first game.</p>\n\n<p>This game is still in Progress and is also one of my first games ever. Feedback always appreciated. When you don't like it, tell me what to change/improve.</p>\n\n<p>:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/841/841fae8689747d09a7ad4b86c734db2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["R4CC00NY"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
