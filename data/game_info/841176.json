Our mission is to find all the coins scattered around the island, before time runs out.</p>\n<p>The counter just below the map is the time within EpicIsland, which will tie into a day-night cycle that will be included in the prototype later.</p>\n<p>If you don't find all the coins in the given time, it will start the game over again. Instead, if you find them, you only have to look up to feel blessed by the Gods of EpicIsland.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T08:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9ead5b0a37544d8d2e5971cc1e17c01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FranDevGame"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
