The aircraft is similar to the aeroplanes of the 1930s. The simulator has a HUD and basic controls. The flight physics are slightly simplified to ensure ease of piloting. But in general, the game is aimed at having some realism.</p>\n<p>I plan to develop the game in several directions. The main ones are:</p>\n<p>1) Creating physics models of different realism level.</p>\n<p>2) Adding new aircraft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:04:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84f329056ab439622179b462c4599c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yeryomin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
