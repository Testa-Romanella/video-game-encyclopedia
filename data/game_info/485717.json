I put something together just to see what it would look like. Right now all I've got is some basic Steel pushing and a button that shoots out a useless coin. If I keep going with this, my next feature I would like to implement would be dropping a coin on the ground and having it function like a normal metal block (which shouldn't be too difficult I don't think.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music is original. It was created for another personal project of mine, but I don't know how well it fits with the Mistborn theme.</p>\n<p>There are a few bugs where pushing can get you caught in a wall, but overall I think it turned out well.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other ideas I have:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0-I'd like to add some enemies in that you can take down with a coinshot, though I'm not very good with enemy AI.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>- I think pewter would be more of a constant ability that allows you not to take fall damage, etc. Though I think a punch mechanic would be fun (this sprite doesn't have a punch animation though)\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Custom artwork would be really great, though I'm no good at it. If there's an eager fan who would like to contribute, let me know!\u00a0 Project was made with GameMaker Studio 2.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>All art is not my own as I was mostly just trying to get some code working: character sprite - https://finalbossblues.itch.io/pixel-platformer-pack\u00a0</p>\n<p>moon image - @untiedgames</p>\n<p>tileset - https://aamatniekss.itch.io/fantasy-forest-pixel-art-tileset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51b/51bee781a06becd611f294dc0fd7d73e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mightyjor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
