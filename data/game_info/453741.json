It's hiking time! And that means lots of people going outside to the nature to enjoy a breath of fresh forest air. But little they know of what hides there, up in the mountain. He is hairy, big and strong, but more importantly, hungry. He loves snowboard also. One would think that the lack of snow would prevent this treacherous yeti from practising his favourite sport. Unfortunately, when lunch is ready to be eaten you have to use everything at your disposal to take a bite as fast as possible before it escapes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-----\u00a0INSTRUCTIONS -----</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The player controls a snowboarder yeti. He has to avoid the obstacles on the way, while eating humans ( to heal wounds caused by anyunfortunate impacts). While doing so, he must prove his snowboarding skills by going between the flags that appear on the trail to earn as many points possible.</p>\n<p><strong>----- CONTROLS -----</strong></p>\n<p>AWSD, Arrow\u00a0Keys or Left Stick (Gamepad) to <strong>MOVE</strong></p>\n<p>Space or Face Button Down\u00a0(Gamepad) to Jump</p>\n<p><em>Music and SFX by \u00d3scar S\u00e1nchez Navarro</em></p>\n<p>Art Design by Yoel De Sanctis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T06:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc79b68fa383f2e0ed59474842a21e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yoelDSC"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
