Because a true isometric mode is not available in any of the RM engines, I\u2019ve used diagonal movement with parallax backdrops to try and achieve something similar.</p>\n<p>The habitat consists of a small cosy underground bunker with various rooms and some appliances (toaster, fridge etc) which can be interacted with. Perhaps a nice place to live during winter or shelter from a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Game.exe to begin. Cursor Keys to move, ENTER key to use. ESCAPE to quit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T09:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b391aeab6d6b788407b6686510455d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jpcu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
