Your actions have brought freedom to the enslaved, and advanced our agenda of giving people the power they lost.\u00a0\r\nThe Government issued an International Arrest Warrant for you, Special Agent Luke Kannon has been put in charge of the operation. You must stay vigilant, Chos3n 0ne, they aren't kidding around.<br/><br/>This is a communication prepared by our best tacticians, with instructions to grant your survival, and the fulfilling of our plan.<br/><br/>You will have ten days until our helicopter reaches you, to bring you to safety. Remember, the aircraft needs to be protected until it gets to destination, as it will be attacked by FBI Drones. Any damage to the helicopter will result in a delay of our victory.\r\nThe FBI has been tasked with your capture. You must use all the traps and contraptions you've created to ensure your safety. The first stage is divided between the Traffic-Control Turrets and the FBI Building Secret Trap. Remember, do not harm civilians, as it will temporarily turn off the turrets! If any agent makes it past these two traps, you will have to resort to the Yard Turret. Use it wisely, and aim well, Chos3n 0ne. It's possible for some agents to get past the Yard Turret. If that happens, use the Robotic Hand to pick them up and throw them in the trash before they break your door!\r\nMake sure no agent gets to you, and you will survive the day. Use the night wisely to rest, and to enjoy the New World we are creating together. <br/><br/>Good Luck, Chos3n 0ne.\r\n\r\n*****************************\u00a0<br/> *****************************\r\nFrom: \"Hacker Global Community\" <br/>To: \"CH0S3N 0N3\" &lt;65.49.\u2b1b\u2b1b.\u2b1b:\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b&gt; <br/>Subject: Instructions. <br/>Date: Mon, 26 Sep \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b 08:26:45 -\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b<br/>Location: USA, \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b \u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b\u2b1b<br/>IMAP Protocol-Version 4<br/>Priority: 3\r\n__\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 __<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\\ END OF TRANSMISSION /", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381667b3b3389763a856dd72b129412d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SickSoupStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
