This is a short demo of a game I made a while back. I was going to upload this a LONGGGG time ago, but there was problems with <strong>Pyinstaller </strong>not working and stuff like that.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, in this game, you control a cute little cube, but eventually, you'll reach a point where the levels impossible! Maybe.... if you.... <strong>pause</strong>?</p>\n<p>This game will <strong>probably not be worked on anymore</strong> because its made of old code and I just don't feel like trying to make sense of my old, bad, code.<br/></p>\n<p>You can still give me <strong>feedback and stuff</strong>, maybe I'll update it, but this probably wont become a full game.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this, cya!
