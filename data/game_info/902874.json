Anything that can be done in real life volleyball will (hopefully) be possible in-game. Additionally, the controls are very physics based and hardcore, almost to the point of a simulation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will <strong>NOT</strong> be easy to pick up, but players are expected to get better and feel the similarities to playing real volleyball as they get better. Players will have to re-learn the timing of their jumps and position themselves according to the ball's location by themselves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T13:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/754/754bd9ceb74679eadf938b661414e895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AzooDev"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
