(I wanted to do a dubstep gun so bad)</p>\n<p>* More interesting projectile sprites for the existing guns.</p>\n<p>* Powerups to make weaker guns more viable later in the game</p>\n<p>* BGM where I do all the instruments with my voice :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:51:03", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ReinAurre"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
