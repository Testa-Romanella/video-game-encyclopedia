{"id": 757019, "slug": "volarpro", "name": "VolarPro", "name_original": "VolarPro", "description": "VolarPro is a professional flight simulator for RC model helicopters. It is intended to provide quick and easy access to an RC helicopter training environment. This flight simulator is a great practice tool for experienced RC pilots. However, it is also great for beginners of this exciting hobby to learn the basics of controlling an RC helicopter in a safe environment.<br/><br/>It is possible to use several types of helicopter models and to load different photo-realistic scenes and environments.<br/><br/>While the helicopter models are simply controlled by touch inputs mimicking a real RC transmitter, an advanced flight physics model is used. The flight simulator model includes:<br/><br/>- Modeling of DC motor and battery behavior<br/>- Flybar-less control algorithms<br/>- Vortex ring state<br/>- Ground effect<br/>- Photo-realistic sceneries including crash objects<br/><br/>Have fun!<br/><br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTES:<br/><br/>1. This is not a game, but a realistic flight simulator with one of the most advanced flight physics on the market. Beginners will need a considerable amount of time to learn flying a helicopter. Do not expect \u201carcade game\u201d-like controls!<br/><br/>2. This version includes 4 free helicopters (Logo 600, T-Rex 450, Sikorsky S-48, Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk) and 4 free sceneries. More free helicopters and sceneries will follow soon.<br/><br/>3. For best experience, install VolarPro on a Tablet.<br/><br/>4.
