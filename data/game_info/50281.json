But wait, you won't be able to beat the level with your starting stats.  To win, you'll have to pick up coins throughout the level and use them to upgrade your abilities when you die.<br/><br/>The more you upgrade, the higher the upgrades cost, and the more you die, the less points you get for the level.  Go for that spicy high score!FEATURES:<br/><br/><ul>-Robots, slimes, and skeletons.  Oh my.</ul><br/><ul>-Around 30 delicious homemade levels.</ul><br/><ul>-Seven big and bad bosses.
