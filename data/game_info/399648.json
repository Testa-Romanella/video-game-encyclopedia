The game features a weather system that randomly switches between clear and rainy, Time of day also constantly changes.</p>\n<p>if you don't act on one of the tanks for 30 seconds, a wandering boid(AI) will startup, all it does it wander around aimlessly so use it for target practice! You can any time get back control from the AI by pressing any of that tank's controls<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you very much for checking it out and leave a comment! \u30fd(\uffe3\uff5e\uffe3\u3000)\u30ce<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0fd11b63ee5db05d04ae28b37abc49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FunkyDealer"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
