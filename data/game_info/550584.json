Controlled by  arms swimming in the ocean with each analogue stick, you have to collect as many of the bath toys as you can in the time provided.<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for GGJOnline! The theme was \"Lost &amp; Found\", so we went with the whole idea of a kid being lost in their own imagination and finding fun from really mundane things, like a bath.<br/><br/>Credits, with social links!<br/>Art: Leanne Koala - https://www.instagram.com/leannekoalaillustration<br/>Programming:\u00a0Val Knight - https://twitter.com/VallerieKnight / https://www.valknight.xyz/</p>\n<p>Music by EmpoweringArts<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7f/d7fba1264c5ee073cbf03d240a460945.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["vallerieknight"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
