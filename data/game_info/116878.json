It is a simple top-down, 2D bullet hell-ish game, reminiscent of Space Invaders.  I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>NOTE: Payments are not expected, though of course they'd be greatly appreciated. <br/></p><p>UPDATE: Fixed an issue with a missing Data folder.  Thanks /u/jashLaviu!</p><p>UPDATE 2: New Version!  Highscores, hit sfx, health indications and more!  The game is, I feel, pretty much at Beta stage now.</p><p>UPDATE 3: Full Beta!  Two more levels, one new enemy, and power-ups have all been introduced in this new version!</p><p>UPDATE 4:  Better background, small UI changes, and fixed the movement!</p><p>UPDATE 5: Minor update to the controls rebinding to fix an issue.</p><p>UPDATE 6: Two (that's right, TWO!) choices of player ship!  My aim now is to refine the UI a little, and add one or two more types of player ship, and a few more enemies, and a couple more levels.</p><p>UPDATE 7: Fixed some absolutely stupid errors that I had made in the code.  Many thanks to /u/warNpeach!</p><p>UPDATE 8: RELEASE!  This is likely the last major update.  The game is at a stage where I am content with it; I will probably add another level or two, and I'll obviously fix any bugs if anyone reports them, but otherwise, I feel it is as complete as I can make it.  On to the next project! </p><p>UPDATE 9: With A LOT of help from Steam user Aero, I've been alerted to some bugs, which I think I've managed to squish.  Many thanks, Aero!</p><p>UPDATE 10: At the request of /u/Midgard9, I've bundled the source code in with the .zip, for you peeps to laugh at my terrible (lack of) coding skill.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e2/3e2984ce3c41453722938543e773fc53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cow_co"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
