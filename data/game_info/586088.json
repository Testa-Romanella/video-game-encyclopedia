Later you'll find some animals are linked and always try to move together. Add into the mix a springy tree that bounces the animals around and you've got some truly perplexing puzzles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Already with 85+ challenging puzzles (and plenty more on the way), Lonely Birds offers countless hours of gameplay and fun for puzzle-loving players!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Bring your own ideas to life and play community created levels with our built-in level editor!
