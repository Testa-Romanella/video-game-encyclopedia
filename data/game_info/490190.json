It produces all kinds of materials: stone, iron, oil and gold. It is your job to expand the machine by placing other machines on top of it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>rotate piece &amp; scroll: mouse wheel.</li><li>click stuff: left mouse button</li><li>deselect piece/deselect remove: right mouse button</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>You have to complete export requirements every so often. click on \"items\" to see them. You can place new machines by clicking on\"build\" and clicking a machine, it has to be placed next to an existing machine (or the starting one). I recommend checking the tooltips of machines in the \"build\" screen, it tells you what each machine does and needs. To start out place a brick maker on the machine and then place an ejector on the brick maker.</p>\n<p><strong>Making:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Made using Godot. This was my first gamejam/codejam. Definitely needed more time than i first thought.\u00a0 Also I'm not really happy with the in-game explanation of the game, but not really planning on adding that anymore.</p>\n<p>This was the first time in a while that I made/completed a game, gamejam worked pretty well for me.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Sounds: <br/>Kenney (www.kenney.nl)</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p><em>Two Finger Johnny </em>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c44b373032369545f9ac036b4cc322.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Deep-Fold"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
