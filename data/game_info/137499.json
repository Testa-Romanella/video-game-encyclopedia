Luckily, you are the kind of leader with your finger on the (literal) button, who can deploy vaccines though the medium of ballistic missiles!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Stop the spread of the virus (red blob) in the cities by LEFT-clicking to launch ballistic mercy on your citizens. The vaccine will expand and push back the virus, but if any remnants remain they will grow back!</p>\n<p>Also, your citizens are driving around like nothing is happening, spreading the infection from city to city! Red cars are carrying the virus; you can't cure them en route (damn filtered air conditioning), but you can build roadblocks to force them to turn around with RIGHT-click. If you don't, when they arrive at their destination the virus will spread from there too.</p>\n<p>You have a limited number of both missiles and roadblocks, see your bar. New missiles are built regularly, but you can only have 2 roadblocks in play at once. Wait for the timer to run out on one of the existing ones before you place another.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>A prototype by Old Doorways<br/></p>\n<p>Programming: Steve Streeting Art: Marie Streeting</p>\r\n3rd party assets\r\n<ul><li>Missile sound by\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/smcameron</li><li>Alert sounds by:<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/jamesabdulrahman</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/danielnieto7</li></ul></li><li>City fall, game over sounds by:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory</li><li>Roadblock sound by:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Bluesy1905</li><li>Music: \"Hiding Your Reality\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</li></ul>\n<p>All licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/936/93676326c73143c6028437d4726f38c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Old Doorways"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
