{"id": 911624, "slug": "a-blessing-and-coerced", "name": "A Blessing and Coerced", "name_original": "A Blessing and Coerced", "description": "<p>When interviewing suspects, police can use unethical tactics to force confessions, leading to a high number of false confessions. This can include lying about evidence, holding length interviews, and convincing innocent people they have committed a crime. The majority of the time, these confessions are they key to their sentencing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I attempted to emulate the stress of someone in an interview, a suspect in a close friends murder. As the player progresses, they explore more about the relationship between the protagonist and the victim, and start to wonder whether your character may be guilty. This doubt mirrors that of suspects who are manipulating into doubting their own innocence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I developed this experience in Processing, a java-based language, for a University project. I developed a system that interprets JSON data consisting of an extensive branching storyline. Some of the player's previous answers affect the story ahead, for example when the player describes their alibi, they must remember this when questioned by the detective later in the experience.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed developing this system and exploring this aspect of police interviews, and would be interested in developing a more extensive representation of this.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/3444c147e8943af62f82b16d73a67dbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Hutchinson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
