You just opened your diner. As the first customers take their seats,  you rush to the kitchen. One customer doesn\u2019t want tomato in his burger, while the other one wants a drink.  Those tables won\u2019t clean up themselves either\u2026  If you take too long, your customers will leave angry and hungry, and you\u2019ll soon go out of business!UPGRADE YOUR RESTAURANT<br/><br/><br/>Start off small, cooking burgers and serving drinks to a few curious customers. By upgrading your restaurant with new recipes, expanding the dining area, hiring staff, and impressing your customers, your diner may quickly become a bustling hot spot. With many different equipment to get and recipe types to learn, can your business earn the coveted 3-star award?KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS<br/><br/><br/>You have your everyday patrons, but special customers with specific quirks and fixations will also visit. You have the construction workers, for instance: they\u2019re always hungry and will order 2 courses. Or the runner, always in a hurry, who usually orders salad. Keep an eye on any punks: they will try to sneak away without paying! And finally, the most feared (and revered) of all: the food critic\u2026NEED MORE STAFF? HIRE YOUR FRIENDS!<br/><br/><br/>Your restaurant will soon be too much for you to manage alone, so hire staff to help you serve your impatient customers\u2026 or even better: call your friends to help you out! Hire servers in the single-player mode or grab a friend to help you finish the wild 2-4 player local co-op campaign. Call orders out, stay organized, and rush to your tables in this crazy, hilarious co-op!KEY FEATURES<br/><ul><li> <strong>Cook and serve</strong> meals as fast as you can to keep your customers happy! <br/></li><li> <strong>Manage and upgrade your restaurant</strong> until you\u2019ve earned the coveted 3-star award<br/></li><li> <strong>Get new equipment and learn recipes</strong> to offer new main courses and side dishes<br/></li><li> <strong>Attend different special customers</strong> such as the runners, construction workers, punks, and food critics <br/></li><li> <strong>Make your business grow</strong> in the single player or co-op campaign with 3 main levels <br/></li><li> <strong>Test your skills</strong> in 12 challenge levels<br/></li><li> <strong>Hire more staff</strong> if you\u2019re playing the single-player campaign\u2026<br/></li><li> \u2026or ask your friends to help you out <strong>in the frantic and hilarious 2-4 couch co-op action!</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/911/911b2eec0e5a7e89b5b36dbb8a6a54db.jpg", "website": "http://www.dinerbros.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 16, "achievements_count": 55, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JAYFLGAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JAYFLGAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
