In the levels you need to defeat all of the enemies before you can move to the next level, in which you can fly, duck, and dodge! With the three available weapons that can be swapped around, even with controller support for running, flying, shooting, switching weapons, and more. To see all of the controls, press tab on the keyboard. There are 5 different levels and a tutorial with the bosses that drop different weapons for you to test out. In some levels you get the jet pack and in others you don't, at least not at the start. In some levels it is necessary to have the jet pack and in others it is necessary to duck. You can change the sensitivity as well as turn on invincibility. (None of the levels require it though)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T04:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b166f18e5522cc3ccd6f02ff22f5ec80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shane Jones"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CthuluPup Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
