However, there are obstacles on the way that the player has to take care of for the truck to safely get to it's destination.<br/><br/>It currently features a soundtrack of 4 hand tailored tracks. Nothing to brag about but worth noting nevertheless.<br/><br/>I didn't really think that the game would perform so good in-browser. That's the reason why the pause menu didn't get an \"un-pause\" button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/952/9526c42d15b745952bde1797e574d5f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["electric_raven913"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
