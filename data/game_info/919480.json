See how much you can get in a run and see how much of the map you can explore!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game uses an experimental technique called \"Sprite-Stacking\" to draw 3D models in a 2D world. The art style was crafted to be retro and inviting for new and returning players!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>I hope you all enjoy the game and please feel free to review or start discussions/leave feedback in the comments below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T18:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/472/472484cc6ee271eed4544eb778889209.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RetroDEV"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
