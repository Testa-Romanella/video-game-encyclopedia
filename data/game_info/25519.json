You're surrounded \n      by marbles, marching slowly but surely down a track. Use a launcher \n      (piloted by a Mii\u2122 of your choice) to shoot marbles with matching colors \n      and wipe them out before they reach the end of the track. Control \n      couldn't be simpler, as all you need to do is twist the Wii Remote\u2122 \n      controller to aim and press the A button to shoot. And the game play \n      remains as addictive and deep as you've come to expect in Nintendo's \n      puzzle games, with five varied play modes, advanced mechanics such as \n      the ability to lob marbles, and a never-ending supply of combos. This \n      definitely isn't your typical game of marbles.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e018ed83a3435cbcc697890d9e626854.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
