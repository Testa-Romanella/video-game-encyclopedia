The first semester was spent prototyping and the second was spent fleshing out and polishing it into a proper game. I spent most of my time on this project modeling, but I also created one of the enemy sprites, created both Cathedral levels, and created the textures to go with the stone walls I made; as well as created the starting point for the audio manager, and created and implemented a tilemap for the ground textures. I was very happy to work with my team and I don't think it could have gone any better given the team's skillset.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T11:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/793a9e966ffc753a6aa2dbd586f02689.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyler Haley"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
