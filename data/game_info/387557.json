You have to <strong>understand </strong>his research, and <strong>make a game about it</strong>. Your game have to be in<strong> agreement with the thesis</strong>, represent <strong>value</strong>, and <strong>help people to understand the importance of his research.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Our scientist work with the <strong>SNCF </strong>(french train company) on a solution <strong>against the invasition of plants </strong>on the trains rails. In fact, \"bad plants\" grow <strong>quickly</strong>, and make the rail <strong>unusable </strong>because of there <strong>heigh</strong>.</p>\n<p>His solution: <strong>To plant a plant named \"Poaceae\"</strong>. This plant is a <strong>real blessing</strong> for him. His value is to \"<strong>fight</strong>\" against the \"<strong>bad plants</strong>\", and take her <strong>territory</strong>. <strong>This plant is low, so the trains can move normaly with her.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This solution is <strong>ecologic </strong>because you don't use <strong>pesticide</strong>, and <strong>easy </strong>to <strong>implement</strong>.</p>\n\r\nGame design:\r\nHigh concept:\r\n<p>Superpoa\u00a0is a <strong>shooter/territory conquest</strong>\u00a0on a <strong>checkerboard</strong>.\u00a0The player have to <strong>conquer </strong>the map <strong>invaded by bad plants.</strong> In a <strong>TPS view, </strong>you can <strong>shoot a seed </strong>on bad plants to kill it.</p>\n<p>You fight different bad plants, on different map, until the <strong>boss</strong>. You have to clean all maps to win, but be careful bad plants can <strong>shoot too.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Experience: \"Territory conquest\".</strong></p>\r\nMecanics:\r\n<p>- <strong>Shoot</strong>. This this the only mecanics, with the shoot you can move and kill. We use \"zen design\" to use 1 mecanics for lot of resulting.</p>\r\nMap:\r\n<p>The map was designed in a circle <strong>divide </strong>in <strong>4 area:</strong></p>\n<p>Every area is a different challenge for the player. The first is the \"tuto\", second and thrid is the \"skill validation\" area, finally the last is the challenge with the boss.</p>\n\r\nSuperpoa finish second of the Scientific Game Jam 2019\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/855/855bc47afd0eb536b7c9786b0ff114bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angelo_pinho"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
