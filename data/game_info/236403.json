It can stand on its own.</p>\n\n<p>Was originally not going to release it on itch, but thought actually it fits in fine here alongside my other work. It's not very long, but I\u00a0really like it and had a lot of fun making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd704f1eaa8e29631b636b8c1c717ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
