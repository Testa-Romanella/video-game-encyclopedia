{"id": 933715, "slug": "accuse-c64", "name": "Accuse [C64]", "name_original": "Accuse [C64]", "description": "<p>After the minimal <strong>Cloak of Darkness</strong> demo game, I decided to reimplement\u00a0another <em>\"classic\"</em> little <strong>IF </strong>game, using my <strong>storytllr64, </strong>my WIP\u00a0<strong>C64 graphic text adventure engine</strong>.\u00a0</p><p>This time I've selected\u00a0Accuse, by\u00a0<strong>David A. Wheeler</strong>, a 2007 (vaguely) Cluedo-like replayable game, released under GPL 2 or later license (yes, that means I'll release my version under the same license too).</p>\n<p>A <strong>murder</strong>, in a <strong>mansion</strong>, with <strong>three suspects</strong>, <strong>three potential murder weapons</strong>, and <strong>five locations</strong>, and you, a detective with \"powers\", able to understand if a specific accusation is correct or not.</p>\n<p>Being each play based on a random selection, you could play this game more than once, even if (as even the original author admitted) this is more a logical puzzle game than\u00a0a mystery game (so the environment is just \"for fun\" than something you need to analyze).</p>\n<p>Anyway, the game is free, the source code is available, and I guess that my <strong>Accuse </strong>release could be worth a try if you're into this kind of game :-)<br/></p>\n<p>Some basic instructions (available also in-game)</p><p>- your goal is to find who's the murderer, which weapon he/she used, and in which room he/she committed the crime. To find that you rely solely on your accusation abilities - that will give you implicit hints, telling you if your accusation is completely wrong, or if partially wrong.</p>\n<p>- your accusation must include the suspect, the\u00a0weapon, and the\u00a0location. Location is *implicit* (you must be in a location to accuse someone to have killed the victim there) so you must invite the suspect\u00a0<strong>there</strong>. You need to have there the weapon too, but you can pick it up and have it with you, so that's easier. Accusation is done writing \"<strong>accuse &lt;suspect&gt; with &lt;weapon&gt;</strong>\"\r\n</p>\n<p>- in the original game each accusation must be completely different from the previous one (you can't accuse the same person twice in a row, nor use the same weapon, or the same place). I made my game a bit simpler, removing the each-time-a-different-place part (you don't need to change also the location from one accusation and the next one)</p>\n<p>- I changed the syntax for asking suspects to move to a different location. You must write \"<strong>invite &lt;suspect&gt; to &lt;place&gt;</strong>\" or \"<strong>request &lt;suspect&gt; to &lt;place&gt;</strong>\"\r\n</p>\n<p>- I changed the syntax to give up too - to give up you must write \"<strong>surrender</strong>\" or \"<strong>abandon</strong>\"</p>\n<p>A couple of extra notes:<br/></p>\n<p>- this game has been developed using\u00a0<strong>CC65\u00a0</strong>compiler (https://www.cc65.org/) - it's made in\u00a0<strong>C</strong>\u00a0with some inline\u00a0<strong>asm</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- github repo with source code is <strong>here</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T11:58:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11b/11be65a95bcd55022cc2a7751f8866c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
