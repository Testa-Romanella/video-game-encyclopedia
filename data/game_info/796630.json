A First Person Class-Based Dungeon Crawler!<br/></p>\n<p>Monster Art by https://twitter.com/hutiaweta</p>\n<p>Class and NPC Art by https://twitter.com/goldwright<br/></p>\n<p>Music, SFX, and two monsters are  from Etrian Odyssey and are used as placeholder.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>-READ ME- (Scroll to the Bottom for KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES and GAME MECHANICS THAT ARE NOT EXPLAINED IN GAME AT ALL).<br/></p>\n<p>Hello! If you're playing this, thank you! Unfortunately I've more or less decided to halt work on this project entirely. Poor planning on my part has turned it into a special hell to work on (code management is a pain for rpgs! who knew.)<br/></p>\n<p>Difficulty-wise, this game isn't easy! You'll probably be struggling for the first couple of levels until you get more of your kits or you've picked up some disables + agility. Don't be afraid to keep going back to town constantly! Use Boosts!<br/></p>\n<p>There's 3 FOEs, a Boss, 2 Superbosses, and 8 Quests with a Miniboss in the game right now. You will probably be around levels 16-18 by the time you arrive at the Boss. The Superbosses are BeatableTM, but may require minor grinding/min-maxing to beat.<br/></p>\n<p>This should take approximately 3 hours to beat, give or take.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS (customizable in game) (Keyboard/Gamepad):<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrowkeys/D-Pad - Move (Up/Down: Forward/Backward, Left/Right: Rotate)\r\n    </li><li>VF/LR Shoulders - Strafe/Change Some Menus/Check Buffs/Debuffs\r\n    </li><li>X/A : Confirm/Interact\r\n    </li><li>C/X : Cancel/Go Back\r\n    </li><li>Space/Start : Pause\r\n    </li><li>CTRL/Select: Check Map\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>CLASS EQUIP INFO <br/></p>\n<ul><li>New Members will come fully Equipped out, depending on their portrait.\r\n    </li><li>All Classes (Except Beast) can equip Helmets/Gloves/Boosts/Accessories\r\n    </li><li>Alchemist: Gun, Staff, Tweed\r\n    </li><li>Beast: Only Accessories (But can equip 4 of them.)\r\n    </li><li>Chirurgeon: Staff, Sword, Gun, Gambeson, Tweed.\r\n    </li><li>Dancer: Any Weapon, Gambeson, Tweed.\r\n    </li><li>Fighter: Spear, Hammer, Chestplate.\r\n    </li><li>Gunner: Gun, Shield, Chestplate, Gambeson, Tweed.\r\n    </li><li>Hexer: Dagger, Staff, Tweed.\r\n    </li><li>Knight: Sword, Hammer, Shield, Chestplate, Gambeson, Tweed.\r\n    </li><li>Scout: Bow, Dagger, Gambeson, Tweed.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>NOTABLE BATTLE MECHANICS (I might be misremembering some stuff)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Boosting an action increases its acting speed, power, infliction rate, guarding power, and generally just whatever in general. It is generated by attacking and being hit (i think).</li><li>Bindings (Head/Arm/Leg) all affect different values; Head affects incoming TEC Damage, Arm Affects Outgoing STR Damage, and Leg Negates Evasion, all on top of blocking specific skills. If I remember correctly, wearing the appropriate armor piece (Helmet/Gloves/Boots) will also help block that specific binding!</li><li>The Forge System is how you power up your equipment! Don't forget to use it after selling monster drops! (Sell the quest reward items to use them for forging!)</li><li>The little red bar on everyone's HP bar is their Enmity Level. It influences targeting by enemies! </li></ul>\n<p>- KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES -</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0There's a buncha visual glitches/oddities but afaik they do not impact gameplay. These are primarily tied to how the battles process steps and frankly it requires tearing the whole thing apart to fix and BUDDY, THATS A LOT OF WORK. THERE'S A LOT OF LINES.</li><li>There's a very weird interaction with Knight that has Protector that might cause it to protect enemies? I honestly do not know what the heck is going on with it but let me know if you have a Knight in your party and an enemy suddenly is guarding and taking less damage.</li><li>Spear Echo's Requirements aren't displayed correctly. The requirements are 1 Level of each Elemental Spear + Level 10 Spear Mastery. There might be other requirements not displaying clearly but I think that's the only one that's REALLY bad.</li><li>There MIGHT be a clip, you MIGHT softlock yourself with it, I left it in for now because it's funny and if you figure it out you may as well play with it. I don't think you can actually do anything game breaking with it but if so, well, have fun!</li><li>You can almost definitely do weird stuff with the FOEs. That whole thing is prone to errors. Sorry in advance lol.</li><li>I won't really fix anything unless it crashes/hardlocks the game. It's play as is!</li><li>Honestly I probably forgot Something, but who knows!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T14:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b0d18994d49e2e68555a00e348b0cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lily Cutesmith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
