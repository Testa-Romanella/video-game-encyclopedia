I call it Hello Weed because the dialog and color scheme\u00a0makes it\u00a0about weed. It takes about 15 seconds to play. I suspect many people will play it minimally twice. Have fun and do not eat the grass. Weed is fine though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T07:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dec/dece644ab87bdd39b509a49963bf976e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Squeekems"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
