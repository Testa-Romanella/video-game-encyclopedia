Given the amount of attention and investment that these kinds of games can cultivate, I figured that they can be an engaging tool for workplace learning.<br/></p>\n<p>Because I\u2019m trained in youth work, I made the topic about youth work so I wouldn't have to consult outside subject matter experts. In other scenarios, instructional designers will likely have to collaborate with subject matter experts to gain the necessary background knowledge for an effective exercise.\r\n </p>\n<p>I would primarily recommend this as a midpoint assessment for basic training. While the game does keep score of right and wrong responses, it encourages replay instead of merely keeping track of outcomes. There are many ways to expand this format: adding narration and dialogue, images and reference materials, customizing the player/learner's role for different playthroughs, allowing for player/learner input that future player/learners can view in future plays, etc.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T12:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fc/9fc31ec1067d4fb640b00d77b5f674f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leilaben"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
