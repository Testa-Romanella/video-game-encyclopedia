I might finish it and update this eventually, though.</p>\n\r\nDescription &amp; Thoughts\r\n<p>I wanted to finish this for the game jam \"Mini Jam 82 - Doodle\", but I've been ill and I\u00a0didn't have enough time or energy to finish it in three days. The minigame at the end is supposed to have a goal and a way to \"win\", but I didn't have time to work on that, so as of now\u00a0it's just kind of a\u00a0pointless bubble-popping simulator.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(... And I'm way too anxious to submit it during the voting period, too. I might update this, though when I have the energy..)</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun with this, though! Also, this jam is\u00a0the first game jam I've ever joined and actually contributed to, and I'm so nervous. I have no idea if I'm doing this right (but oh god I hope so).</p>\n<p>The one-room limitation was a very hard thing to work with, but it also led me to this idea, which was kind of heartwarming to write!</p>\n\n<p>All art and sounds made by me!</p>\n<p>Fonts used in the game are\u00a0Cute Written and Vividly.</p>\n<p>The paper texture used for the background was found here!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f1f0e467bc4abd80b166a482e9fc848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MayhemCats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
