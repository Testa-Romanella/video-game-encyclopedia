You move around and pick up the water as it drops from the very rectangular cloud. If one litre of acid touches the ground you loose, you can score points by neutralising the acid in your bucket.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left and Right Shifts for movement</p>\n<p>Hold space bar to neutralize acid.</p>\n\n<p>Hope someone finds it fun. :)))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T00:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6ae1d598e11f00174c39fed9f2c2b91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GuiLogarithm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
