This was my first time working with the Godot game engine, and I feel this project came out pretty well. In Godot, the first example project on the engine's website is a small game called \"Dodge the Creeps\". Thus, our goal for this project was to take this example game and make our own thing out of it.</p>\n<p>So the root of my idea for this project was, \"what if I take the character from dodge the creeps and give him a sword?\", and that's precisely what I did. Instead of the player getting a higher score by surviving for as long as possible, the player now gains points by hitting enemies with a sword.</p>\n<p>This project was cool because I made all the assets for this game. Pixel art, animations, and even music, though, I didn't make the text font used for the UI.</p>\n<p>The controls for this game are pretty simple:</p>\n<p>W - move up</p>\n<p>A - move left</p>\n<p>S - move down</p>\n<p>D - move right</p>\n<p>Spacebar - swing sword</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T08:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f984f284eaffb1d6ca06d6ffc730bf27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan Rosenblatt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
