You are the only defense AI in place and have little time to save your puny humans from the oncoming death that awaits. Can you keep the robot army at bay? How long will you survive?</p><p>RobotDash is a prototype game created for a gameJam. The concept is simple, you joust with your opponent and attempt to kill them before they kill you. The concept is solid and can be expanded upon with multiplayer and even robot weapon changes. If popular we will invest some time into further development.</p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/><ul><li>LMB to attack</li><li>RMB to block</li><li>WASD to move</li><li>Spacebar to Jump</li><li>ESC to exit game to desktop</li></ul><strong>CREDITS:</strong><ul><li>Artist - Riuthamus (Sean)</li><li>Coder - Cyberblaststudios (Jaden)</li><li>Sound Engineer - iCompose (Skyler)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecfce1a332e5ab02bfe103efab0d2007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["riuthamus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
