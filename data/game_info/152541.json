It was released for iOS in 2011.  In 2013, we did a remake of the game in Unity, creating a vertical slice prototype for the Midwest Game Developers Conference.  This is that prototype.  </p><p>Note* The Unity project for this game is all sorts of messed up due to many upgraded versions of many things.  Therefore, the only platform we can find a build of for this game is the Mac build.  Basically we are uploading it here for posterity sake.  Also, the X button is Jump... not Space like the GIF says.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae656d9f5d56311abbb7b32f2090c66a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["ShuddaHaddaLottaFun"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
