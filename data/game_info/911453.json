Enter, stage left: Zooblies. A strange and plethoric (in both senses of the word) species of creatures whose sole purpose is to be in the way of our protagonist\u2019s goal: a (possibly metaphorical) path through a series of dark dungeons and out into the light. Learn the ways (rules) of the world (game) and help Dood achieve personal growth and realization!!!<br/><br/>K but it\u2019s a physics-based puzzle platformer where each type of Zooblie has its own behavior. When Dood moves, time moves. When Dood stops, time stops, and you as the player-god-emperor can drag and rotate blue things (but only blue things) into whatever mise-en-scene pleases your divine (?) sensibilities.<br/><br/><ul><li>Help Dood reach the exit in over 50 levels!<br/></li><li>Encounter all X types of Zooblies!<br/></li><li>\u00a1Collect todas las estrellas for a challenge especial!<br/></li><li>Watch as Dood busts some righteous dance moves!</li></ul><br/>Help a Dood out, will ya?\ud83d\udc96", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T03:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/335fb2a450387efb608532ab238ed4d8.jpg", "website": "https://zoobliesgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jolly Crouton Media"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Jolly Crouton Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
