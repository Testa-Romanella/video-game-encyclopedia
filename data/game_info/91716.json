Everything in this game, especially visuals and music, has been created for the purpose of giving the player a certain kind of emotion. The setting takes place in a surreal, virtual world, made out of abstract 3d graphics, where the player must explore ten levels, each with an individual theme. </p><p>\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0445. The game has two language options.<br/></p><p><em>The year is 2072. Virtual reality has become a worldwide phenomenon, allowing people to sink into the virtual web, while experiencing isolation in real life. A VR engineer has finished his virtual reality project, but before uploading it on the web, he decides to visit it for the last time, plunging deeper into his own surreal world.</em><br/> <br/> The atmosphere of the game has been inspired by early 80's electronic music (including such examples as <strong>Gary Numan</strong> and <strong>Depeche Mode</strong>), <strong>System Shock</strong> and the 1984 version of the film <strong>Metropolis</strong>. In some ways, the game is like an interactive conceptual music album, where each level is like a short song. The project features a 100% original soundtrack inspired by classic electronic music.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Only play the game if you're fine with the visuals presented in trailer and screenshots.
