Predictable grid-based movement ensures that you know where you are, but other players don\u2019t. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. Using special abilities and firing your Invisigun will also momentarily give you away. Along with items and powerups, these mechanics reward stealth, trickery, reflex, forethought, deception, bluffing, and awareness. A variety of lovingly-made environments, maps, game modes, and abilities combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.<br/><br/><br/>\tMulti-playerCompete with up to<strong> 4 friends</strong> or bots on a single screen\t\tSingle-playerTest your skills in a <strong>single player</strong> challenge mode with 3 skill levels\t\tOnline PlayMix and match <strong>local</strong> and <strong>online</strong> players\tController SupportControl your hero using <strong>gamepads</strong> or the keyboard\t\tPixel ArtEnjoy hand-crafted <strong>pixel art</strong> made with care\t\tUnique HeroesBattle your friends using a variety of <strong>heroes</strong>, each with unique special abilities\tMany EnvironmentsExplore <strong>60 maps</strong> spread across <strong>5 planets</strong>, each with unique interactivity, hazards, and weather effects\t\tUnique Game ModesChoose from a variety of <strong>game modes</strong> playable on every map for deep replayability\t\tMatch ModifiersCustomize the game mode conditions with <strong>match modifiers</strong>\tInstant ReplaysView hilariously revealing <strong>instant replays</strong> that expose tactics\t\tExport GIFsSave instant replays as animated <strong>GIFs</strong>\t\tFull SoundtrackGroove to the custom pulsing, ambient <strong>soundtrack</strong> composed by Paper Sound<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurvivalLast hero standing wins a point each round\t\tHunterEvery kill earns a point during the rounds\t\tZone ControlMaintain control of the zone to score points\t\tDeadlineMost kills within a time limit wins\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    CarrierSurvive while controlling the token\t    Land GrabClaim the most territory to win\t    Beast TamerTame the wild beasts and collect rewards to win", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T11:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f00f49ba599bf7e8b3c09e6bebfe572.jpg", "website": "http://www.sombr.com", "rating": 3.87, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 199, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sombr Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sombr Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
