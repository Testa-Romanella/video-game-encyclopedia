In that level, we just have to destroy all enemies.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of all Major Modifications:</p>\n<ol><li>Added Level 2, in which there is a timer and you have to destroy all enemies before you run out of time.</li><li>Added Level 3, which is the Boss level. The shooters around the boss ship cannot be destroyed, you have to shoot past them, aiming for the boss ship.</li><li>A lot of UI modifications:<ol><li>Changed the player ship sprite. Now it's the \"Millennium Falcon\" from StarWars; drawn using paint app.</li><li>Animated Main Menu (color shifts and text size oscillates (you'll see)</li><li>Added Timer on top of Levels which are time limited (in this case, lvl 2)</li><li>Added boss health in boss level.</li><li>Number of lives player has left.
