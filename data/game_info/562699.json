While everyone else went to the bathroom to wash their hands for lunch, you were tasked with guarding the food from all the hungry animals that live in Enoshima. Guard your precious rice balls until 12:00 lunch time!</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong><br/>This was our first attempt at PICO-8. It was a fun and educational experience! There are tons of inefficiencies in the code that we only realized later, and there is no music. However, despite all that, we are rather proud of our first effort.</p>\n<p>Also available on the Lexaloffle forums.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/046be1e4a0a7d0ad85f39ad5fba82a3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nice Gear Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
