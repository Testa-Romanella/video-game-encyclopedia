{"id": 363367, "slug": "move-the-tower-11", "name": "Move the Tower (1.1)", "name_original": "Move the Tower (1.1)", "description": "<p>\"Move the tower!\" is a limited classical tower defense game with multiple lanes. The difference is that there is only one tower, and you have to move it manually in order to protect the base. Enemies spawn on the right and your base is on the left. Use your left mouse click to move the \"tower\" (tank) from one platform to the other. However, be careful because while it is in movement, it won't be able to shoot. Eliminate enemies to unlock more powerful weapons like piercing lasers and area of effect bombs. You can also block enemies by blocking with your tower. The game ends when an enemy breaches your line of defense and reaches your base on the left of your screen or your life gets to 0.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Please share your highscores on a comment!</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Left mouse only- simple controls! Like any tower/lane defense game, your tower shoots automatically. Move the tower location to any of the platforms by clicking on them with your mouse/touchscreen. Change your active weapon with the buttons at the bottom. Note only one weapon is enabled initially, you will need to score points to enable more weapons.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Context</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Developed in under 72 hours, it was initially developed for GMTK2019 gamejam, then I improved it a bit more for the \"Indie Dev Jam en Espa\u00f1ol #4\". The original idea was to do a tower defense game with only one tower having to move through several positions (hence meeting the criteria \"SOLO\u00a0MOVERSE\" (only moving). With more time the game could be refined to have more levels, more weapons, more kinds of enemies, more strategies...</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All the code and most assets have been created by Jaime aka \"Jynus\".
