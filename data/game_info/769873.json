It is a mystery thriller. The dialogues were originally made for a visual novel so they might read a little different than your typical books.\u00a0This is an early beta, and I will go back to fix things later when school is over. I have not properly playtested the game, so please give me feedback when you play.</p>\n<p>If you want to restart from the start of the game, you will have to close your tab and re-open the link. Because sadly, that is how Sugarcube works (I think).</p>\n<p>Okay, that's it, enjoy and let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T08:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/97817223ff19a87feefd7562f97ada70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Keanichii"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
