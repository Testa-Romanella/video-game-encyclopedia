While her naturally-infused projectiles inflict little damage, they can temporarily immobilize the player, leaving you vulnerable for critical seconds\u00a0as she closes the distance to pummel you with rapidly-infused high kicks.</li><li><strong>Airborne Sentries</strong> - Within the preliminary sectors of the alien outpost lurks a prowling assortment of\u00a0\u00a0flying robotic drones, still beholden to their original directives to eliminate any potential \"threats\"\u00a0in their vicinity.\u00a0 They hover about slowly and attack with lasers.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n\n<strong>arrow keys</strong>movement<strong>left control</strong>fire<strong>space bar</strong>jump<strong>escape</strong>pause game\r\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>All assets - comprising textures, models, images, music and audio effects -\u00a0 are completely original, with the exception of five sound FX files, as listed below.</em></p>\n<ul><li><em>\"Face Punch\"\u00a0 sound- purchased from Sounddogs.com</em></li><li><em>\"Cougar Attack\"\u00a0 sound -purchased from Sounddogs.com</em></li><li><em>\"Man Falling Scream\" sound - purchased from Sounddogs.com</em></li><li><em>\"Sci-Fi Laser\" sound - purchased from Sounddogs.com</em></li><li><em>\"Cartoon Laser\"\u00a0sound - purchased from Sounddogs.com (originally attributed to Hanna Barbera Studios)</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T11:18:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b63/b63229d871350705968c9dda82420898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 393, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesse Hamm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
