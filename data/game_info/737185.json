And that's how the game works! Make words out of the words presented! The longer the words the more points you get, and you can set a timer to increase the intensity!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Levels</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The levels are based on opening lines from famous novels and words from specific categories, but you can create your own level by pressing the plus button in the main menu and pasting in your own text.</p>\n<p><strong>Playing:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I found that playing it in fullscreen works better, and that on phone it fits the screen better if you download it rather than playing in browser.</p>\n<p>If you get stuck on a word, after ten seconds a skip button will appear opposite the scramble button. Also using the scramble button can help spot words you might have missed!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Options</strong></p>\n<p>You can change the font in the options menu, as well as the audio and background colour.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fonts used:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/ghouls-ghosts-and-goblins.font<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.dafont.com/open-dyslexic.font</p>\n<p><strong>Music:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Origami_Repetika/the-happy-puppy-collection/l...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dictionary used:</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/dwyl/english-words<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ad/0adfd01837d486fd325e5ba5447e3ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Philip Newsham"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
