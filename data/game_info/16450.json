{"id": 16450, "slug": "alpha-prime", "name": "Alpha Prime", "name_original": "Alpha Prime", "description": "<p>Alpha Prime is a singleplayer FPS game developed by Black Element Software.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>In a distant future, a space asteroid mining corporation successfully find a never before seen asteroid with the richest deposits of a mineral, that is used for powering the intergalactic space vessels. When the State Business Federation deployed miners on this asteroid, it was discovered that this amount of a valuable resource causes insomnia, drives the miners both suicidal and homicidal. Further mining was deemed highly dangerous, causing further evacuation of the miners. The asteroid was sealed off. Arnold Weiss is recruited by his old friend for a search and rescue mission.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features ten fairly open-ended levels. The environments of the game are highly interactive. The gameplay of the game resembles the classic first-person shooters of the early 2000s with several new additions. The players can hack terminals that reveal the events happened on the asteroid before the evacuation of a mining mission. Sometimes, the players have to solve basic hacking puzzles to proceed further. A classical Max Payne influenced bullet time is also present in the game. This allows to slow down time in the most complicated combat situations. </p>\n<h3>Soundtrack</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s soundtrack composed by the Czech musician Kasny Jaroslav was highly praised by the critics. All the sixteen tracks were released to the public free of charge.</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "2006-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-30T20:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4272c2d42e647a4651cd9703a9fa2e.jpg", "website": "http://www.alpha-prime.com/", "rating": 2.49, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 873, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 13, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 48, "suggestions_count": 533, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 49, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Element"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Bohemia Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
