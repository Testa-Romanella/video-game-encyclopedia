Though the boss marks his word and will not fire you but can only do so if you make a mistake. This is a game where time counts and\u00a0the rule book changes every 7 seconds\u00a0and many rules are based on the day and night cycle based on the clock and the window. Note that early morning is halfway A.M. and late night is P.M. and Chronus is also the currency paid on the table.\u00a0 Also note that when there are contradictions between information (Your item is non-mailable but it isn't the early morning and both rules are both present about mailability and you being not allowed to give mail at early morning), always throw the mail away and morning and day means the same thing. No tips also...</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Space to Start off the game, Z to Give the Mail, X to Throw away the Mail (when it doesn't meet standards or the rules), Long Press C to Check Information (Z and X are disabled when this is being pressed)<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Programming, (First time to do) Music and Art: Takago</p>\n<p>(All Pixel) Art: Miyaki\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/763e404ed48e9070bdb4fbc9840bdf57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
