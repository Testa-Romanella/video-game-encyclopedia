I planned to give this game a lot of mechanics but ran out of time again lol (and so I am submitting another prototype). Compared to the last game jam I feel I made a lot more progress with what can be done. My ultimate plan was to create a game revolving around a civilization way in the future trying to understand ancient human ruins left over. The code got kinda sghetti-fied towards the end, I realise I need to plan out my systems next time around haha.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:20:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/201/2018734d8553650ef509ba291817512c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BitRapture"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
