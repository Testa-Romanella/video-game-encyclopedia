The game could not be finished in time and technically is unplayable, yet it was fun working on that and getting to learn about brand new stuff. Our initial idea was to have farm where play can grow plants which could then be turned into gaming cards which are used to combat enemies. <br/></p>\n<p>You were supposed to fight enemies from different world and collect different world seeds that could be merged to grow new powerful plants giving you new gaming cards with combined elements (fire, water, darkness).<br/><br/>You are welcome to try out our game. Maybe you will find a way to interact yourself in our game, going through menus or vibing with plants in farm. <br/></p>\n<p>created by:</p><p>Raisinbat</p><p>Fallen</p><p>HerrColonel</p><p>Potato ceo\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T05:39:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/334/3347180766f34f67d9381e9163ec1803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["potatoincceo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
