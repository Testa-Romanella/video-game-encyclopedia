The object of the game is to be the player with the highest score at the end of the game.  Players take turns rolling two dice and adding the value of their roll to that round\u2019s running total.  All players\u2019 rolls contribute to the round\u2019s running total.  At any time during the round, one or more player(s) may \u201cBANK\u201d the points from that round\u2019s running total to lock in their points before someone rolls a 7 and resets the BANK. <br/><br/>Once all players have BANKed or a 7 is rolled, players move on to the next round to continue trying to BANK more points than their opponents.
