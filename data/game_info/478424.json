And in our case, a (robot) hitman has\u00a0meticulously wipe all floors in a\u00a0skyscrapper. It's a shame, because \"it\" also erase all videotape data from the cctvs and now we cannot identify it's robot plate number. Thanks to the \"timeline reconstruction\" perfomed by the spacetime inspectors we can analyse it's movement and retrieve it.</p>\n<p>Controls/Gameplay : zqsd/wasd for movement, mouse to aim, click to (un)shoot the bullet. Everytime you enter the room you have to place and rotate the hitman as the death robots ressurect and you can click on the bullet. With everyone left alive you can take the elevator for the next floor.</p>\n<p>Development : So that's was a little bit chaotic for me. I try to do everything in the game : coding art and even the sounds (didn't include them). The game was actively made in 2 days because I was busy in the beginning of the week. Technicaly speaking, the game was made with Unity 2020.1. I used VS 2017 for coding, Aseprite for producing the 2D asset and Audacity for sound effects. The game run on Windows only.</p>\n<p>Improvements : Like in every game jams that I done, during the development I have a lot of ideas that popped in my mind but because of the lack of time (management) I just write it and do not implements them.</p>\n<p>- robots can walk before they die (so in the game after\u00a0their\u00a0resurection).</p>\n<p>- robots can handle multiple shoots before they really die.</p>\n<p>- robot can shoot at the player before their death and break objects in the floor because the robot hitman use them as a cover.</p>\n<p>- The game could have been a rythm game if the click of the players have been synchronized with a music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72f9d72cdbbba39715110672cbbbfcd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkKiwi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
