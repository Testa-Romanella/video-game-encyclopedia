Keep in mind it is kinda hard and therefore,\u00a0might cause rage.</p>\n<p>PS: I was constantly fighting off the urge to put the 'YEET!' sound as the sound effect for every time you Yeet xD.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>#BrackeysGameJam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T06:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf2aea467d4f080209ce67d81ea2e49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harlox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
