Rotate the screen to move your character to the exit.<br/>Navigate your way around the obstacles to find a safe path to the end.<h3>Avoid Traps</h3>Avoid the fire placed around the edges of the map<h3>Keys</h3>Some doors need keys to open to progress. Find these around the map to move to other areas<h3>Portals</h3>The exit isnt the only portal. Some portals can take you to new areas, but not always take you back.<h3>Bonus Levels</h3>Collect coins along the way. You may have enough to unlock bonus levels from the main screen.<h3>Save Progress</h3>Once a level is completed, the progress is saved so you never forget your place.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T03:13:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f49/f49d16d0df05f8cd38f18dd4c4c5474c.jpg", "website": "https://tradinghousegames.com.au/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trading House Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Trading House Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
