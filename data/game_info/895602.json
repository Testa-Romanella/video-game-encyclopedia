Trailer bunks on the truck while empty. I'll do my best to keep this updated\u00a0as the 22 version moves along since it will be getting trip bunks, a loading strap for the trailer and some other small details in the near future. Hope you enjoy. Stay safe and get logs!</p>\n<p>Credits are Snowrunner, Hum3d, Seb Croteau and myself.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b4db003e8563e4fb1ec11efa7cf503.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elk Falls Logging"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
