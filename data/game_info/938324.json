I've decided to upload it how it is now due to having spent at least 9 months for this to be the current result, and if I want to add more features and improve already existing ones I might have to rebuild the whole thing from mostly scratch. So I'm uploading it how it is now in hopes of recieving feedback so that I can improve both the game and my own skills\u00a0further.
