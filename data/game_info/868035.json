Will you be able to grant her freedom?</p>\n<p><strong>The map changes as you fall asleep, every 10 seconds</strong>, and is procedurally generated.</p>\r\nThe game's Ludum Dare 51 page can be found\u00a0here.\r\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><strong>Left mouse click</strong> to wake up Nar, she will then follow your pointer when you <strong>hold</strong> the button.</p>\n<p>While she sleeps, take your time to observe your surroundings and plan out an optimal path.<br/>She cannot stay awake for more than 10 seconds. Make every decision count!</p>\n<p>Dig walls by \"pushing\" through them. The harder the wall, the longer it takes to break it down, and the walls get sturdier every few days.</p>\n\n<p>You must survive for long enough to collect <strong>10 tablets</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You consume 1 Satiety unit every night, and replenish these by eating <strong>corn cobs</strong>\u00a0that can be found in bags lying on the ground, or sold by the merchant.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which, this cunning fox peddler's <strong>shop</strong> opens up at random spots 7 days a week.<br/>He sells a random selection of food, hearts and tablets.</p>\n<p>You can also buy a <strong>pickaxe upgrade</strong> from him, which <strong>permanently increases your digging speed</strong> and stacks up to 3 times.</p>\n\n<p>These goods, however, are not for free. You must exchange them with <strong>red ore</strong>.<br/>Veins can be found across the cave system every day, sometimes in clusters.</p>\n\n<p>This maze is also home to many blood-sucking bats, which are attracted to your smell. Collide with one and you lose a heart.<br/>Be careful, as a single bat can hit you multiple times.</p>\n<p>If you sleep with no satiety or if your hearts reach 0, you know what awaits you...</p>\n\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>ETERNARC is a game I made in 48 hours from scratch, for the Ludum Dare 51 Compo bracket.</p>\n<p>The game includes a Compo Mode toggle for LD51 participants.<br/>Please note that some changes are kept with\u00a0Compo Mode enabled.<br/>More details in the downloadable build's README file.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Engine: Unity, with Feel and DoozyUI</li><li>Sprites: Aseprite</li><li>Audio: Bfxr + Audacity</li><li>Music: Reaper + Chipsynth PortaFM VST (OPLL FM)</li><li>Preprod: Notion</li><li>Font: Lanapixel</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T18:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315b8d6a6702b93543d427a172a0bf0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Talops"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
