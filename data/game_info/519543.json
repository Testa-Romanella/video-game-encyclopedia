But I consider it as success because I've never manage to make a playable game/complete in a game jam before as a solo developer. Hopefully in the future if I ever go solo again I'll be able to finish a simple game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b74b40f7fcb9f2709baff87481f5f905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chris LY"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
