The game was built almost a year ago now!<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tI worked on the game for 3 months, and created all the assets from artwork and animation, to the game design and programming! This project quickly became very passionate for me, and even though it is a pretty short game (40 minutes) I hope you guys can still find some pleasure in playing it! \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game definitely has its flaws, and I want no one to expect a pristine and polished gaming experience! I am now working on a project that will hopefully accomplish both of those things, and then some!  </p><p>\r\n\t---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Contact</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks for checking out my game and feedback is greatly appreciated!
