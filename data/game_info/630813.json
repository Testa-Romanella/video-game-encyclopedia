{"id": 630813, "slug": "morphy", "name": "Morphy", "name_original": "Morphy", "description": "<p><strong>The Game is meant to be played in Fullscreen</strong><br/><br/>In Morphy it's your task to reach the goal by changing your size \u2013 both ways: width and height. Sounds simple? Yes! But is it?<br/></p>\n<p>Grow your width and your height, otherwise you won't fit through doors. On other occasions, you'll simply be too light or heavy for the pads, which trigger the door.<br/><br/> Hence you can grow and shrink in all directions, up to nine different sizes are possible \u2013 so yes, size does matter. And of course it affects physics, too. Don't expect to jump that high, big chungus! If you need to reach high places, it's better to be small. While in other situations it can be an advantage to be really flat, high or square. <br/><br/>Still think it's easy? Wait until you meet our Map Desinger. Over the course of a map it's up to you to decide how much or less you change your size. You can do it once or double, but beware, things get too small or too big very easly! <br/><br/>You need to combine all skills, sizes and weight to master this game. It's easy to understand and hard to master. Will you reach the end?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>A / D: Left / Right Movement\r\n</li><li>W / Space: Jump\r\n</li><li>E: Interact\r\n</li><li>R: Restart Level\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong><br/>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Programming, Design etc.<ul><li>Fezumlix<br/>\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Ideas &amp; Playtesting:<ul><li>Lukip</li><li>Blackalpha</li><li>Rolino</li><li>jr1810</li><li>Thedeadrisin<br/>\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Design:<ul><li>0x00c<br/>\u00a0</li></ul></li><li>Font:<ul><li>TrashHand</li></ul></li></ul><p>This Game was made for the GDL July 2021 Gamejam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:09:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5fcbaaca91041156bb2d509c122991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fezu Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
