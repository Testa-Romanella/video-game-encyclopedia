I'd like to get better at making games that are widely accessible by all types of players so this was a great learning opportunity.\u00a0If I had more time I would have fixed a few bugs, made some\u00a0QoL changes, added 2 more\u00a0scenes to uncover the whole past, and added unique SFX for each of the objects selected. Overall I'm happy with the way the game turned out!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>P.S. </strong><em>Thanks for playing &amp; have a great day</em><em>!\u00a0:)</em></p>\n<p><em>- Vomdrache</em></p>\n<p><strong>Asset List:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Title BGM</li><li>Game BGM</li><li>Artwork\u00a0(Loved their work so much.
