Now, cursed to do what\u2019s right for free, his powers constantly draining away, Doug will have to win his power back.<br/><br/>Never slow down. Slow is how the curse takes hold!!<br/><br/><br/>The Weaponographist is a high-speed, top-down dungeon-crawling arena combat game. Cool kids might call it a \u201cRoguelike\u201d.<br/><br/>You play as Doug McGrave, famous demon hunter for hire. Highest level, bestest gear, ruggedly handsome, and unrepentant jerk. For refusing to aid one stinking demon-infested town, you are immediately \u2013 and deservedly \u2013 cursed. Your powers, your wealth, and your weapons\u2026 Poof! Gone. To overcome the curse, you\u2019ll need to make use of whatever weapons you can find.<br/>Swords, chainsaws, machine guns, pogo sticks\u2026 Use them while you can.<br/>Because they\u2019ll all fall apart in your hands.<br/><br/><br/>I can\u2019t think of a curse that ever did anyone any good. And this one, doubly so.<br/><br/>Fill up your combo meter by defeating evil, vanquish demons to regain your strength, and weaken the curse while you can. But beware.<br/>Whenever you aren\u2019t attacking, your combo will quickly drain away, and the curse will continue to sap your strength. Only by killing monsters quickly, adapting to new weapons, and removing the curse in pieces can Doug make his way through the depths of the dungeon and get the hell out of this one-horse town.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Roguelike adventure in a fast-paced arena filled with a variety of creatures to kill.<br/></li><li>Pulse-pounding weapon swaps requiring constant adaptation to defeat the enemy swarms.<br/></li><li>A frantic paced curse requiring constant engagement to catch and surpass the difficulty curve.<br/></li><li>Copious demon gore and goop to trade with Hellside vendors for powerful upgrades.<br/></li><li>Epic soundtrack from Christopher Hoag.</li></ul><br/><strong>Go forth, kill a bunch of things, and don\u2019t even feel bad.</strong><br/>-The Weaponographist", "metacritic": 58, "released": "2015-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b4/3b4f9ffa2d78025b6f582a15e697aaad.jpg", "website": "http://www.puuba.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 63, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Puuba"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Puuba"], "esrb_rating": null}
