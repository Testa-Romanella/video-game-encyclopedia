As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular Terminator in the film.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-03T00:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6a7/6a77f4d4028bbb1403102cef41760164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.44, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 10, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["SunSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Sunsoft"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
