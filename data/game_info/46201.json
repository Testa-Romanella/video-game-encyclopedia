Amidst the dust, few that remain are still clinging to their existence, far beyond the point where they could be called human.<br/><br/>But the hope still lingers.<br/><br/><br/>On the outskirts of the forgotten city, a lone soul awakens from millennial slumber. Lost and forgotten, he finds himself in catacombs and now his way lies through the treacherous ruins to the very heart of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Enoch \u2013 Underground is a roguelike action-RPG title set in an ancient city destroyed long time ago. The player takes control of the awakened \u2013 one of the few survivors left in the city. Without goal and without memories he starts his way through the ruins striving to find his place in this hostile world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gameplay is based on classic roguelike RPGs with such features as procedurally assembled environments, precise battle system and generous loot, but makes accessibility a staple of game\u2019s design.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The character progression is entirely loot-based, eliminating the need for complex character menus while retaining flexibility and customization options. Each weapon type has unique stats and attack patterns, armor can provide additional protection and sometimes valuable buffs, trinkets and mutagens allow to change character\u2019s abilities, providing an advantage in combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Encounters require patience and precision but give just enough room for error to get familiar with enemy\u2019s attack patterns and develop a strategy to withstand them. The game is balanced to be hard but fair so that completing the playthrough gives the sense of achievement while the process of doing so does not feel like a chore. <br/><br/><br/><br/><ul> <li>Different weapon types, each with unique attack patterns<br/> </li><li>Powerful artifacts that boost player stats or provide new skills<br/> </li><li>Varied environments and enemies<br/> </li><li>Precise, dynamic combat system<br/> </li><li>Unlockable characters and challenges for even greater variety <br/> </li><li>Deadly environmental traps that you can turn to your advantage<br/> </li><li>Devastating special attacks and skills</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb5/eb5f2552678ab1f4012a15f4bec48e7e.jpg", "website": "http://unwhale.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unwhale Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unwhale Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
