This roguelike bullet hell shoot-em-up features 3 levels, with each level divided into 3 survival rounds. Every round ends with a random special challenge that lasts 30 seconds - perhaps you must survive without using your weapon, or perhaps everything will move at hyperspeed!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>With each challenge you succeed, Poker Chip Charlie will ask you to pick a card, granting you a unique powerup. You begin your run with a random powerup as well, so you must adapt your strategy to the whims of fate. If you lose all your health, you might still have another chance - if fortune smiles on you in your Roll of Fate, you may continue right where you were defeated. Become stronger by collecting many powerups, and face the Lord of Die in battle to escape the Chaos Casino!</p>\n<p>\u00a0WASD = move\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse/left-click = aim/shoot, select item, confirm menu\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spacebar = dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f3b84089ac6b2e8ea6f29ba10c2888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brandonsimpson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
