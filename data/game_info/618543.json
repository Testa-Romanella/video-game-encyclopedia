These modules can change how fast he moves or how gravity effects him. The only catch is - once two modules get plugged in, they link together. ModME can only hold two modules at a time though, so choose your modules carefully! Combine speed with gravity to jump higher - but only when moving quickly - and many other fun combinations in this puzzle-platformer.<br/><br/>Shout out to https://ambientcg.com/ for some of the textures used in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:07:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52e/52ec6795ed09128b91ddea0a791b7177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["littlehawk93"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
