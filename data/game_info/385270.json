So I made the decision to just\u00a0develop and release a game no matter what.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype of my first game. I will update it as I continue to work on the game.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p><em>Movement - hold the left mouse button and move to the direction you want to go.</em></p>\n<p><em>Avoid the\u00a0<strong>H</strong><strong>ammer </strong>and collect <strong>Coffee Bean Bags</strong>. Collect more than 3 bags\u00a0and\u00a0your coffee cup will be set on fire during which you\u00a0can collect\u00a0<strong>Hammers </strong>for extra points without it destroying the cup.</em></p>\n<p>I know that the game does not look like the game of the dreams, but we all have to start somewhere, right? If you have any suggestions or comments, please leave them in the section below.</p>\n<p>Big thanks everyone...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T06:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4af11e20686b2ebec746b34fd86984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["redCoffee Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
