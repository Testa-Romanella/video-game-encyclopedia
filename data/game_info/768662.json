You must explore all three levels to find all of the toys. Each of our levels has a different main mechanic in them so that each level feels fresh. Our mechanics include a crusher, similar to a thwomp from Mario, a bounce pad object, and decaying platforms. Each level will look completely different from each other as well as play differently.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Each level has its own unique feel so each of the levels are memorable in their own way, levels also increasingly get harder to keep the player challenged. The levels also incorporate a\u00a0multitude of different ways to play the level out. Our game also has cartoony styled music and sound effects which perfectly fit the theme of the game. There are a bunch of coins for you to collect some will be hidden well, try to find them all. Pumbear's Problem is similar to 3d platformers of old, this game is for people who have played 3d platformers before, or someone who likes the art style and theme of our game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76acfbb706fb0dc9fd5cf5fd454efaff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pumbear'sproblem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
