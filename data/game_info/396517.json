{"id": 396517, "slug": "fire-rush", "name": "Fire Rush", "name_original": "Fire Rush", "description": "<p>\r\nFire Rush is a single\r\nplayer serious game that wants to spread some simple fire-fighting\r\nknowledges. In Fire Rush, players need to use different resources to\r\nextinguish different types of fire or using some actions to finally\r\nextinguish all the fire.</p>\n<p> Fire\r\nRush has mainly two part of game play, Collect Resources and Use\r\nResources. \r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The rule of collect\r\nresources</strong> is inspired from a board game named Halli Galli:</p>\n<p>\r\nThere will be four\r\ncards on the board and each of these cards may have a resource to\r\nextinguish the fire (currently water, dry powder, and foam) or a\r\nspecial action (currently cut the electronic and cut the gas\r\nresource). If the player wants to collect the resource, he should\r\nselect the resource that has the total symbols of 5. Also, players\r\ncan select the card with special action, then the player will get the\r\nspecial action on that card (if the player has other unused special\r\naction, it will be replaced)</p>\n<p>\r\nIf the card players\r\nclicked is neither special action card, nor resource card that have\r\nexactly five symbols, the player will get punished (all the fire on\r\nthe board will get bigger).</p>\n<p>\r\nThe resources have a\r\ncapacity, if some resource reaches the capacity and the player keep\r\ncollet it, it won\u2019t give player any additional resource and there\r\nwon\u2019t be any punishment also.</p>\n<p>\r\nAfter a short time, the\r\nplayer doesn\u2019t select any cards, the earliest card on the board\r\nwill be replaced by the next card. The player can also manually hit\r\nthe Draw button, but each time hitting the button will increase the\r\npower of all the fire on the board.</p>\n<p> <strong>The rule of use\r\nresources</strong>:</p>\n<p>\r\nPlayers can use the\r\nspecial action to change the type of all the fire on the board (e.g.\r\nif the player use Cut the Electronic, all the electronic fire on the\r\nboard will turn into normal fire), and the special action will\r\ndiscard. However, if the player uses the wrong special action, it\r\nwill have no effect to the fire on the board (e.g. use Cut the\r\nElectronic to the oil fire), and the special action will discard\r\nalso.</p>\n<p>\r\nAll the fires on the\r\nboard have their own fire power (the number of resources burns per\r\nturn) and the spread speed (power getting bigger per turn). Different\r\ntype of fire has different coefficient to calculate the final spread\r\nspeed (general spread speed * coefficient).</p>\n<p>\r\nWhen the player chooses\r\none of his resources to extinguish the fire, that resource will be\r\ndivided to all the fires. If the resource has positive effect to the\r\nfire (e.g. use water to normal fire), the total fire will decrease\r\nspecific number. Otherwise, if the resource has negative effect to\r\nthe fire (e.g. use water to electronic fire), the fire will increase\r\ninstead.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe condition of losing\r\nthe game is the total fire exceeds the fire capacity of the level, or\r\nall the resources are burned by fire. The winning condition is\r\nextinguishing all the fire before trigger the condition of losing.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe designing purpose\r\nof Fire Rush is not only for fun, but also spread some simple\r\nfire-fighting knowledges. I hope the players can learn something from\r\nit and make the right choice immediately once the fire occurred.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Team Members:</p>\n<p>Programmer: Yiheng Pan (SBU)</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0Yufan Yu (CQUT)</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0Xiaochen Zhang (HIT)</p>\n<p>Programmer:\u00a0Refar Liang (BJUT)</p>\n<p>Art Designer: Zhiqing Cui (WHU)</p>\n<p>Art Designer:\u00a0Ghazi Ekberjan Miao (SAHU)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd01e9cf37e14d5fab00318656514f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daemonn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
