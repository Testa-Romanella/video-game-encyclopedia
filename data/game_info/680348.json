{"id": 680348, "slug": "reinvent", "name": "REINVENT", "name_original": "REINVENT", "description": "<p>REINVENT is a game about exploration, both mechanically and in theme, and we hope to encourage the player to explore aspects of themselves (with gender identity as a focus) as they play.</p>\n<p>The premise, beyond what we have layed out in this demo, would be a series of levels that see the player explore new and exciting areas of the world beyond the factory. Between each level the player would be provided with an opportunity to reflect, and prompted to redesign their character from a continually-expanding range of options.</p>\n<p> As they go on their travels they would encounter other NPCs much like the one encountered in the demo, who would similarly introduce new mechanics for the player, and provide additional options for customising their character.\u00a0 As the player encounters these NPCs, they would also be provided with the opportunity to play a section of the game as the NPC, both a way to tutorialise the new mechanic and also to allow the player to inhabit a different character, possibly one of a different gender to their own, for a short while. The player would also encounter other NPCs on a similar journey of exploration to themselves, who would appear to be exploring and changing between each encounter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's the general conceit, thanks again for checking out the demo!</p>\n<p>- Robin, Andy, &amp; Joseph<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a28/a2807c676141ac0711b3c18e8000e82d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jedwardsedwards"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
