Fast paced downhill (and uphill, if you want to work for it), loads of jumping and virtual friends...but beware of the YETI! You can ski forever and you don't even need a lift card &lt;3<br/>\n<br/>\r\n#SkiJump is currently pretty sandboxy and it's like being inside our heads (literally mushroom forest right now). You can hunt scores, but your score gets reset when Yeti catches you, so try to kill him instead (you have bow&amp;spear for that). Have a look at the leaderboards when you feel like competing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheats (on keyboard until we make an in-game menu): <br/>\r\nBaby Slope (start area): B<br/>\r\nBig Slope: R<br/>\r\nMusic on/off: M<br/>\r\nOverlay UI/Score (for clean screen/streaming): O<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKnown bugs-turned-features:<br/>\r\nFlying tress (and not just the ones you hit) <br/>\r\nWobbly Yeti...he's not da smartest fella<br/>\r\nSelfiestick is funky on some VR controllers - will fix shortly<br/>\r\nSkiers can get stuck, so please help them out of their misery. They follow you, so be friendly!<br/>\r\nWill add more big slopes and freestyle funk VERY SOON<br/>\n<br/>\r\n#ScreamIfYouWantToGoFaster<br/>\r\n@VRUnicorns", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3fe4e1ff657f49935e5ccc5f31fb460d.jpg", "website": "http://www.vrunicorns.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VRUnicorns"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bandello"], "esrb_rating": null}
