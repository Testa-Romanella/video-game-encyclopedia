Here are a couple of examples:<br/><br/><strong>Time to Rage</strong><br/>A rocket booster on one hand and a baseball bat in the other is all you need to destroy any target that comes your way.<br/>You are the destruction!<br/><br/><strong>Aim and Shoot</strong><br/>A rocket booster on one hand and a gun in the other - I mean what else would a crazy rocket guy bring to a mountain rally? <br/>Be ready to aim and shoot! <br/><br/><strong>Rocket Rush</strong><br/>What could be more awesome than rockets? Right, more rocket! <br/>Because double the speed makes up for twice the fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T02:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb70bd6527a1eaff8a3278e2604866a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 485, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EpiXR Games UG"], "esrb_rating": null}
