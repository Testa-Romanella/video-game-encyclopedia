Eventually I will make a RPG and it probably will be in unity or something. Now with only 40% of the intended content due to gain jam time limitations!\r\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Play as a Vault, a local creation of the Mall of Infinity, Infinity City's go-to destination for one-stop shopping of anything, everything. Run a shop (that has no minigames tied to it still), manage the store (that barely has any customization right now), and control your shop and employees alike (which none of this is implemented). Inspired by Recettear and Night of the Consumers, though most features intended were not added.<br/><br/>Controls: </p>\n<p>Standard RPGMaker Controls of Z to interact, X for Menu when not in shop. Q/Page Up/Left Bumper for the in-shop menu and functions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a1d2a2ff85a1c6362b20d33a0db0cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vagrant Slime"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
