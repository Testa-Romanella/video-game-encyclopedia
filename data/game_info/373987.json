You can find me on twitter!\u00a0\u00a0https://twitter.com/aconfuseddragon</p>\n<p>All the lovely music and sounds were done by\u00a0Viktor Kraus, who you can also find on twitter!\u00a0https://twitter.com/ViktorKraus2</p>\n<p>I am going to keep everything completely free but if you would like to support me and any possible future developments\u00a0you could buy me a ko-fi!</p>\n<p>https://ko-fi.com/aconfuseddragon<br/></p><p><strong>--ABOUT--</strong></p>\n<p>This is my first game so please be gentle, there may be some bugs, some of which I can or can't fix (lol). This game is played best on a 1080 height screen <strong>WITH A MOUSE</strong>. If you can get a good score with a trackpad, you are defs an out of this world gamer ;)</p>\n<p>I tried to find a good balance between easy and challenging, it may take you a few tries to get used to the gameplay, but it will help increase your clicking accuracy!!</p><p>I am also planning to add an android version soon! I can't afford to put it on a store so I will upload the apk here, sorry if it seems risky, but don't worry I'm too dumb to hack into peoples phones. The app shouldn't ask for any permissions.</p>\n<p>The background night ambience is from www.zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd12204e03b6e9862c7e6102ab8bcd04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["aconfuseddragon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
