One or two players could control space fighters assigned to deal with an alien invasion using incredible firepower through eight stages. The game is somewhat parodical as many of the game\u2019s mini-bosses resemble previous Taito game characters and the ending theme consists of a Beethoven song.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:59", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Taito"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
