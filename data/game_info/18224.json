You will wander the world, fighting as a knight, lurking in the shadows as a rogue, or using the diplomat\u2019s charm to persuade people to your cause.

The game is based on a true story \u2013 a story of kings, heirs, a kingdom, castle sieges and an invading army from the east.<br/>The King is long dead and his sons now are taking control of the kingdom. Their desire for power has made them enemies. Brother against brother. The kingdom is weak and It\u2019s now easy target for the ottoman forces.<br/><br/><strong>The protagonist</strong><br/><br/>In the midst of this plunder and chaos, a son of a farmer\u2019s son will emerge as a hero. His home destroyed and his family murdered by the invading army, he must redeem his failure to protect those he loved and set things right again. Avenging the dead, safeguarding the kingdom\u2019s rightful ruler, and restoring order will prove no small feat for our adventurer. But beware - this is not a fantasy fairytale, and you are not the chosen one! This will be a tough, dirty job that only a champion with enough wits and strength will survive.<br/><br/><strong>Freedom of choice</strong><br/><br/>Your character is defined by your choices. Your abilities and stats grow depending on what you do. You decide how you want to appear. Every quest can be solved in multiple ways. Branched dialogue trees grant you the freedom to express yourself. Your reputation is based on your choices, and every choice you make carries appropriate consequences. There are no class restrictions, you can do anything you want to.<br/>Stand tall as a brave knight in powerful armor, going it alone or finding allies to lead into battle. Complete quests with brute force. Intimidate and threaten your enemies. Be confident, arrogant, or righteous.<br/>Sneak behind enemy lines as an invisible thief and assassinate the enemy. Stab. Snipe. Strangle from behind. Resolve difficult situations as an invisible phantom, stealing important evidence and threatening people to get information.<br/>Win hearts as a popular diplomat, persuading nobles with your silver tongue and convincing them to fight one another. Use your wits rather than your muscles to get the job done. Share drinks with people, be the funny guy everyone likes\u2026 and then stab your rivals in the back when they least expect it.<br/><br/><strong>Quests</strong><br/><br/>We\u2019re not trying to create the biggest game ever; we want to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. We are trying to create something special for all of you out there. Our world is large, but again, the focus is on creating a natural, organic space, not one so overpopulated. The same philosophy applies to quests. We don\u2019t want to inundate players with an insane amount of quests, but rather ensure that those we have are rich in detail, with multiple solutions (including non-violent approaches, where appropriate) suiting different play styles and making an impact on the world.<br/><br/><strong><strong>Branching dialogue</strong></strong><br/><br/>Conversation is an integral aspect of The Fallen Kingdom, just as important as combat and just as difficult. It isn\u2019t possible to absent-mindedly click through every dialogue option. Your time to make decisions is limited, your choices affect your relationships with others, and you cannot take back what you say. Just like in real life, you have to think carefully about what you say to whom.<br/><br/><strong>The World</strong><br/><br/>Freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want<br/><br/>The exploration of the world is free. If you don\u2019t want to play the main quest line, it will \u201cwait\u201d for you, and you can go about exploring the world and doing other stuff \u2013 side quests, random events, hunting, crafting, small side stories, and much more. A giant world based on beautiful, real-world locations<br/>Unity 5 allows us to quickly create huge areas of landscape. The world includes a sprawling city, vast forests, majestic castles, and dozens of villages and hamlets devastated by war. Of course, there will also be underground locations to discover, like mines, secret passages, and catacombs.<br/><strong>Emergent Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>Our world is a living, breathing, and COMPLEX ecosystem, ready to be toyed with. Everything happens for a reason, every character has his/her daily routine, and every routine can be affected by the player. Characters are able to react properly to all player actions and adjust their routines to them.<br/><br/><strong>Advanced reputation and law system</strong><br/><br/>The world will organically react to your deeds. NPCs will report your crimes to authorities, who will punish you for your crimes accordingly, either with a fine, time in jail, or by subjecting you to the stocks or torture. Crime will affect economics and NPC behavior; people will get suspicious or aggressive after unresolved crimes. Your reputation will spread by word of mouth.<br/><br/><strong>Technology</strong><br/><br/>We are using Unity 5 to power our game. It\u2019s a powerful, out-of-the-box toolset that runs on all major platforms and allows us to concentrate on the game instead of technology. Unity 5 affords us with unparalleled macro and micro details, including unlimited viewing distance, HD textures on all objects, and a functional day/night cycle with varying weather patterns, all set in a vast, beautifully lit, seamless world, free of load times.<br/><br/><strong>Who are we?</strong><br/><br/>We are a small studio (for now) with BIG ideas and plans for the future. Our team is highly experienced and we are familiar with the typical challenges, roadblocks, and potential pitfalls that come with the development of an open world game. Specifically, we need 12 months to finish the game (that includes 5 months for testing and fixing bugs and errors). We also believe that direct input from the community will help us a lot, allowing us to create an experience that people actually want to play, and we\u2019re currently devising ways to make transparent our development process.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe2/fe2b791daca934358fc157fde0d23231.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 58}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 493, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radostin Stoychev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Real Games Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
