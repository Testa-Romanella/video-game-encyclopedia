It aims to combine the feeling of early 90's point and click adventure games with a unique story. It has controls that should be easy to understand even for someone who has not played a game of this type before. The graphics and sound are designed to be minimalistic, with \"pixel art\" / \"low resolution\" graphics and simple sound effects.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStory:<br/>\r\nBarney is down on his luck. He has lost his job and now it looks like he might lose his one true love too. It is time to take matters into your own hands. Do you have what it takes to save the day?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is an Indie game without any financial backing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2abfab3f927861e761bde38c5e34286.jpg", "website": "https://rikard-swahn.github.io/barney/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gubbi Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Gubbi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
