Every week Mrs. Jones sends him with work to do over the weekend. THE WEEKEND! The weekend use to be a time for friends and Will Smack movies (like Men in White 3: The Alien Stain). Anyways it should be clear that Mrs. Jones is a super vile woman indeed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Sunday night now and our friend Herbert\u2019s mom has just told him it\u2019s homework time, or else no video games this week. Honestly his mom and Mrs. Jones might be in cahoots, but who knows I\u2019m just the narrator. Herbert is a master of procrastination; washroom breaks, snacks and the internet. Poor boy doesn\u2019t have a chance.</p>\n<p>Can you help Herbert overcome all the distractions so he can focus on his homework before bedtime? It might not be saving the world, but this poor boy might lose video games for the week if you don\u2019t do something. If you can\u2019t stop his inevitable fate, perhaps you can at least delay it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse &amp; Keyboard</p>\n<p>MOVE: WASD</p>\n<p>Aim: Mouse</p>\n<p>Dash: Space</p>\n<p>Pencil Attack: Left Mouse</p>\n<p>Multi-Pencil Attack: Right</p>\n<p>Brain Dump Attack: Q</p>\n\n<p>Gamepad:\u00a0</p>\n<p>MOVE: Right Joystick</p>\n<p>Aim: Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Dash: X/A (South Button)</p>\n<p>Pencil Attack: Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Multi-Pencil Attack: Left Trigger</p>\n<p>Brain Dump Attack: O/B (East Button)</p><p><strong><em>Follow us on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0and\u00a0</em></strong><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em>\u00a0for updates on upcoming projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T21:45:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2cd9d2129f3d8954de90bebf43c6c2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HotChickStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
