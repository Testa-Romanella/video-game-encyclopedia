There are 25 different rooms, each with numerous hazards that you will have to navigate. Some hazards\u00a0will test your memory, platforming skills and most of all, your patience. Your only saving grace are the save points in each room. While at times it might not feel like it, every room is 100% beatable (it is only NEARLY impossible, after all). Can you beat all the rooms without raging or quitting?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>AD - move left and right</li><li>Spacebar - jump</li><li>R - reset/reload</li><li>F - toggle fullscreen mode</li><li>M - toggle mute\u00a0 \u00a0</li><li>P - bring up menu in game\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<ul><li>Move - Left joystick</li><li>Jump - A/B (Xbox) X/O (PS4)</li><li>Restart/ Reload - Right Bumper</li><li>Mute - Left Bumper</li><li>Menu - Start</li></ul>\n\n<p>Downloadable Version</p>\n<p>The downloadable version comes with 3 additional modes for $1:</p>\n<ul><li>Easy Mode: For those that want to play the game, but need a little help.</li><li>Gauntlet Mode: One life.
