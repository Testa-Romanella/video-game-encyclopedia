Thomas was a minor character in one of the pixel video games, but he dreamed of more. One day Thomas decided to make his own game about himself. The game turned out to be simple, but Thomas was pleased with this result. He called the game \"Thomas Jump Course\". Well, the name is not as original as the game itself. Anyway, Thomas uploaded it to an indie games website. He's waiting for YOUR evaluation. So play this game!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, I completely forgot to tell you about controls! Use A and D to walk sideways, SPACE to jump. Thomas didn't make the main menu or the pause button, so if you want to quit the game, press ES\u0421.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T16:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/67416a8a9f3ecac5c1caa577e4c82e70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["[MT]Masyan"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
