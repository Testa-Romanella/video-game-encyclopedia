I added new enemies, upgrades and savegame system. Feel the nostalgia!</p>\n<p>You are your people's last hope in fending off the alien invasion. Use the orbital cannon to shoot down enemy ships. Aim with the crosshair and smash the left mouse button to fire. Be careful not to hit your planet!. After each wave you have some time to collect scrapmetal (use WASD or arrow keys to control the harvester), which you can use to purchase upgrades and powerups.</p>\n<p>Don't bump into an enemy - your turret will be destroyed. Enemy bullets won't hurt you (not yet?), except for mini missiles shot by one of the enemies.</p>\n<p>Your battle is lost when:<br/>- All your turrets have been destroyed.<br/>- The planet has taken too much damage.<br/>- Enemy bullet or missile reaches the planet core, regardless of total damage taken.</p>\n<p>Any feedback and bug reports are welcome!<br/></p>\n<p>Nebula image in the background by\u00a0Viktor Hahn\u00a0under the CC-BY 4.0 license</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0ca7933881b7b7e8cee252966715311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yatchan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
