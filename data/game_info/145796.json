At the end you get a Score and pps(points per second). <br/><br/>After beating a level a new one is generated up to \"infinity\". You can see the level seed at the top of the screen. You can change the seed of the maze also by pressing ctrl, editing it and then pressing enter. <br/></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p>If you are into Ludum Dare 31 you can rate and comment it here:</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&amp;uid=11053<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c4/7c4b75c10650e98e569fd21a86704619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["The-Force"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
