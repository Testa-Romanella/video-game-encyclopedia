Explore randomly generated islands, abandoned structures, and the vast wilderness to gather resources for survival. But be aware; There are dozens of other online players with the same goal.<h3>Survive</h3><br/><br/><br/>You and dozens of other online players all share the same goal: <strong>survive by any means necessary.</strong><br/><br/>You find yourself stranded on an island with no recollection of how you got there. With no means to escape, you must learn to adapt to your surroundings. With only a rock and a torch at your disposal, you must gather resources to craft tools to improve your chance of surviving. Crafting tools such as hatchets, pickaxes, or primitive weapons will aid you in taking on your surroundings, but be warned, you are not alone.<h3>Construct your home</h3><br/><br/><br/>Build a place to call home for <strong>you and your loot.</strong><br/><br/>Upgrade your base with new materials you gather while in the wild (Wood, Stone, Metal). Start by placing your <strong>core foundation</strong>, from there you can expand with floors, walls, doorways and ceilings. Place <strong>deployables</strong> in your base such as storage boxes, furnaces, or beds to help you store your loot, set a spawn point, or make advancements with your materials.<h3>The Islands</h3><br/><br/><br/>Don\u2019t get too familiar with your surroundings, as <strong>everything will regenerate weekly.</strong><br/><br/>Procedurally generated every <strong>Friday</strong>, no two islands are the same, meaning you will never play on the same map for longer than one week at a time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T07:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4065d035051cfe0e952bc5c02a06fb.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/AirysSoftware/", "rating": 1.77, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 15, "owned": 437, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strayed Team", "BrineTeam", "Crustacean Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Airys Software", "BrineTeam", "Crustacean Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
