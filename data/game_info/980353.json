Built on the same systems and features from the original Galactic Ruler, but designed around 2 new playable races.<br/><br/><br/>Players begin with a single homeworld and limited military, and must explore a unique galaxy with each playthrough, expand their territory and military forces, exploit resources from various planets in different star systems, and possibly exterminate the competition.<br/><br/><br/>In the campaigns, players will interact with all the different races. Each other race has their own goals and agenda. Players will need to decide which factions would make good allies and which factions are simply a stepping stone to greater glory.<br/><br/><br/>To be competitive in the galaxy, players will leverage new technologies and ship designs. Initially players only have access to their home system, but research will unlock improvements such as FTL travel, beam weapons and shields which can be equipped on new ship designs. Build up your space fleet to keep your people safe.<br/><br/><br/>What the Galactic Ruler series offers that is unique from other games, is that not only does the action take place at space level, but most planets have surfaces that are accessible for colonization or exploitation. This also creates a new battlefield. Players will engage in combat on the planet below and the space above simultaneously.<br/><br/><br/>Galactic Ruler Enlightenment offers real-time strategy game play at both the planetary level and in space! Campaign play expands the series with story driven elements. Lead your faction in diplomacy or conquest across a unique galactic map where any system might hold hostile enemies or resource riches.
