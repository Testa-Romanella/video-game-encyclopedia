The age of European expansion is on the horizon and the Renaissance is in full swing across Europe; but in England, the War of the Roses is in its final throes. Change is coming, but in one little convent in the north of the kingdom, everyone seems blissfully unaware.</p>\n<p>Everyone except Sister Catherine, a beloved nun and firebrand thinker who has just been murdered. In an isolated monastery with an already grisly reputation, any one of the Sisters could be the killer--and Mother Superior is as stumped as anyone else. That's where you come in.</p>\n<p>As an Anchoress, you took an oath to never leave your cell; to devote yourself entirely to God and provide spiritual support to all who came to your door. But as the only Sister who couldn't possibly have committed the crime, you have a new mission: solve the case, before the bishop shutters the convent and the real killer goes unpunished.</p>\n<p>The Superior hasn't told everyone why you've suddenly joined the regular congregation, but something tells you most of these women know exactly what's going on. Who can you trust? Who is being honest, and who has their guard up--and why? Is the convent really haunted? Who killed Sister Catherine? And worst of all... are you next?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Misericorde is planned as a multi-part Visual Novel. Part One is planned for 2021, with a demo release aiming for sometime in the summer. The art and writing is by me, the music is by Lamonaca Dimonza (me) and the backgrounds are a combination of my own photos and pictures from Unsplash! The engine itself is Tyranobuilder. I'll be posting more screens, videos, and eventually a demo soon.<br/></p>\n<p>Website</p>\n<p>Patreon<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T09:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/455/4557bb01e1c0cb0ca2b5a15062040c2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xeecee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
