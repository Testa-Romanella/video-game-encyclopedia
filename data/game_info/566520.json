Each land tile offers a certain amount of energy resources which you may use to continue multiplying and spreading your blobs around the environment. Try to consume every bit of land leaving nothing untouched! Advance through a series of levels of increasing difficulty. Keep your Blob alive as long as you can by consuming the planet in an orderly fashion. <br/><br/>The music of this game features a soothing acoustic guitar ambience that draws the player into the game keeping you clicking for hours as you lose track of time.
