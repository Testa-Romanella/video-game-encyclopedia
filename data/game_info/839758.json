After a while the mining planet will run out of resources and become empty. Before that happens you can build ships that will launch when a mining planet becomes empty. You can make bigger ships that will carry spare resources to other planets.</p>\n<p>The game ends when all mining planets become empty.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Movement:</strong> Left<strong>\u00a0</strong>Click on travel routes between planets.</li><li><strong>Building Ships:</strong>\u00a0Left\u00a0Click on launch points on mining colonies.
