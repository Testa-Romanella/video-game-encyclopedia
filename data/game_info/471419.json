The Vacuum features a non-linear plot that responds strongly to player actions at all stages, and it emphasizes character interactions and investigation over the obtuse and illogical inventory puzzles that were the main cause of the adventure genre\u2019s death in my view.<br/><br/>I made this game in the summer of 2008 in Adventure Game Studio.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:46:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c838a3465e2f6023687f42743ba9b053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davidproctor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
