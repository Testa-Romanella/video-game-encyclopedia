Can be a very active game with higher difficulties.</p>\n<p>Settings can be customized however you want from impossible to loose to impossible to beat. Three presets (easy, medium, and hard) to get you started.</p>\n<p>Developed with Oculus Rift &amp; Touch with an option for 180- and 360-modes.</p>\n<p>NOTE: I have noticed that the contrast between the lights and darkness in darkness mode can be taxing on one's eyes. If yours start feeling strained I'd recommend not playing darkness mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/21627d57ecc42d8e9aa2e36f0c62c6cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew George"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
