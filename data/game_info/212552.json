I made this as an entry for the GMTK 2018 Game Jam, with the theme \"[Genre] without [mechanic]\".\u00a0This is my first game jam, and it was a ton of fun! I\u00a0decided to use Pico-8, a fantasy console programmed using lua. This decision came\u00a0with some serious limitations, including 128x128 display and 16 color palette. All in all, I'm fairly happy for my first game jam, first time using Pico8, and first time using Lua.</p>\n<p>I didn't have time for sound/bgm, and art assets are a bit lacking, including the main menu, but functionality is solid! If you have any comments or thoughts, let me know, as I'm bound to pick this project back up and flesh it out more.</p>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<ul><li>Tower 2 and 3 are not able to be upgraded - (fixed in v0.21)</li><li>Game will break if towers are upgraded above level 7 (fixed in v0.21)</li><li>Money is deducted for the upgrade level above current level (fixed in v0.21)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b97354c38614a893ddfcd02693c2ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goldfsh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
