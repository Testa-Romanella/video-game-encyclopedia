Is this an experiment you \"voluntarily\" participated in? Or maybe you're experimenting on yourself? <br/><br/><br/><strong> <br/>Intoducing... The Delta Labs Photonic Energy Manipulator! <br/><br/>The main feature of the game is a gun that can absorb any type of energy and then use it!</strong> <br/><br/>For example, the energy absorbed from a light bulb will give your gun the ability to shoot low power laser.
