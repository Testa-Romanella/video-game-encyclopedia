You can't just look at it and understand it. The tutorial will come later in development. However, the game is somewhat easy to understand. It may be possible to learn it in ~1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Redo Terrain\u00a0Textures\u00a0</strong>- Let's keep it simple. They're ugly.<br/><br/><br/><strong>DEVELOPMENT STATUS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I do not have much interest in continual development of this game. If everyone seems to love it, I will return. I haven't spent too long making it so the loss isn't that great. Never dedicate a long time to something you aren't interested in. This project taught me a lot. It is still very buggy. I will open source it.<br/><br/>I should point out: I\u00a0started this project shortly after I turned 14. So it has a lot of problems now. A lot of things I\u00a0thought were good then are bad. Unsalvageablely, it seems.</p>\n<p>This game is more of a terrain generator it feels to me some times. I can barely bring myself to fix a lot of bugs.\u00a0I\u00a0learned a lot, though. A lot. A lot lot. A lot lot lot.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact me.</p>\n<p>If for some reason you want to play it (very buggy, thats how bad I made it, but as I said, I learned a lot), you can download it and unzip it. When you unzip it, move the contents of the PERSISTENTDATA folder to LocalLowAppData\\PuffyPenguin\\Axeboro.\u00a0 Then run the game. You might not even be able to get past the menu, sorry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/926b72bb7823fd612c8e9dffc0d1abe9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sriracha6"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
