You can see the FPS, your video card and CPU brand and share it. I'm curious to know how fast different GPU can deal with 10 000 moving cubes.</p>\n<p>This test was made with Unreal Engine 4.26. I try it with Unreal Engine 5 but the FPS is so low that is not very interesting...</p>\n<p>Note: Press \"C\" key to a little dance that pushes away cubes for fun.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:57:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/82892453bd8be8c4927860deda8e4ffa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chrix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
