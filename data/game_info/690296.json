One of my favorites and the one i suggest using is hamachi:\u00a0https://www.vpn.net/<br/><br/>To actually play with hamachi you must type this command by hitting ~ on your keyboard and typing \"open map_Nacht_der_Untoten?listen\"<br/><br/>then your friend has to type \"open (hamachi ip)\" and you will be able to play together :).<br/><br/>Credits:<br/>Map - Sneaky Kitty Game Dev<br/></p>\n<p>Assets - Quixel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T11:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f8056df169431875b72153e9824aec34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bustzee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
