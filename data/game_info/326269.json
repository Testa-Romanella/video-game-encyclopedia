The only way to see the level is to die and let blood cover the play field. Avoid spikes and dangers and maneuver your way through the levels to get to the other pig before you lose all your lives to win! Easier said than done! This game will make you swear, sweat, and want to flip your desk. Not seeing the level is not the only setback as the game is packed with traps, mazes and puzzles that you will never see coming. Make your way through dark levels so hard, that sometimes they even make you exploit in-game glitches.Features<ul><li> A collection of mind-bendingly hard levels<br/></li><li> Classical pixel-perfect platforming with no frame skips<br/></li><li> Full controller support<br/></li><li> Keyboard support for both Arrows and WSAD+Mouse<br/></li><li> Funky music to keep your frustration in check<br/></li><li> Turbo jump!<br/></li><li> Dark Bacon!</li></ul><br/>It's hard, really, really hard.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a9/1a962b07025becb191a1d6324b7372ee.jpg", "website": "http://superpigx.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sos Sosowski"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Sos Sosowski"], "esrb_rating": null}
