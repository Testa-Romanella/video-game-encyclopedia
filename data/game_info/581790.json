You play as a hero who is fated to fight against monsters for all eternity. It\u00a0is\u00a0a slightly\u00a0demanding job, so it's your goal to find a way to escape this fate and reclaim your freedom.<br/><em>Hint:\u00a0I\u00a0didn't have time to implement a way for you to do that, so your only escape is to stop playing the game</em></p>\n<p>NOTE: I\u00a0do not take any credit in making the art or music for this prototype, the links to the respective free assets that I used\u00a0are provided below. I\u00a0only take credit for programming, making sound effects,\u00a0and designing the game, since my goal was to get an opportunity to experiment with game design more.</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0https://o-lobster.itch.io/<br/>Music:\u00a0https://peritune.itch.io/battle-tracks-jrpg-battle-music-collection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/0717f8ead8d0358acd40a95469289bd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Hardwin Bui"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
