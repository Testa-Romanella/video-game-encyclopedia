I was getting reports that the game crashed after the introduction, which leads me to believe the map loading was causing a bottleneck on some systems. I parallelised the map loading into multiple chunks, so this should help?\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlso made some shader modifications. These I can't really debug without testing on lots of systems which... I don't have access to. So those fixes are more of a guessing game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f834e92856d6e4adae74a0c1d41d955f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixelbear"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
