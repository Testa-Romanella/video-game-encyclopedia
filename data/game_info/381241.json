You have no money and no parts. Just a blueprint! You can get money by doing chores around the neighbourhood.</p><p>After almost giving up on this game on day 2, I somehow managed to pull it off. I couldn\u2019t finish all the things I had planned for it turned out ok. I spent the most time on the South Park inspired art style. At the end, after you completed the go-kart, there was supposed to be a race level but I had no time to finish it. Mabye I might do it in a post-jam version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979821b5ca0dc7d8d448c641e5d39d81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pengil"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
