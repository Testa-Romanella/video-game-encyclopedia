As the deity of lost things you will travel all over the heavens, exploring the Philippines' most majestic landscapes and visiting the mortals on earth when your adventures require.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story is immersed in pre-colonial Filipino culture and history; it purposefully sheds Western concepts around gender, sexuality, and religion.</p>\n<p>Within the game, you'll set your pronouns and choose your love interest(s) but gender and sexuality are completely up to your headcanon! You'll also be able to customize your Moonfinder's appearance and personality.</p>\n<p>There are three main personality archetypes in Eye of the Moon; these affect the Moonfinder\u2019s overall demeanor.</p>\n<p><strong>Blue:</strong> <em>charitable and sympathetic</em></p>\n<p><strong>Purple:</strong> <em>playful and mischievous</em></p>\n<p><strong>Red:</strong> <em>aloof and exacting</em></p>\n<p>There are also two other variable traits. These have more to do with how the Moonfinder handles social situations and conflict resolution.</p>\n<p><em>Proactive/reactive</em></p>\n<p><em>Diplomat/fighter</em></p>\n<p>The proactive/reactive trait also affects how the Moonfinder approaches romance.</p>\n<p>Please note, the Moonfinder is <strong>not</strong> a blank slate MC! You can find an MC guide including clothing references and setting appropriate names here.</p>\n\n\n<p>Eye of the Moon features two love interests: <strong>Tala</strong>, goddess of the stars and navigation and <strong>Dumakulem</strong>, god of the mountains and hunting. You can pursue them individually or simultaneously through the poly route!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Tala</strong> pierces stars through the night sky, turning them into brilliant jewels that guide mortals through the dark. It is said that every time a new deity is born, Tala creates a new constellation in the ocean above to welcome them to Kaluwalhatian. Mortals worship her because without the stars as their map they would be lost in the seas.</p>\n<p><strong>Duma</strong> resides in the mountains on earth, teaching and protecting the mortals within his domain. He is one of the most revered amongst the pantheon because of his reputation as a provider: of sustenance, of guidance, of endurance. Whether hunters are still learning to notch their bows or are tracking down the most elusive of prey, Duma is the recipient of their prayers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c59cf81371818089e60d62a553cec70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["atemaarte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
