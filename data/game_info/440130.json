It is an asymmetric cooperative VR game requiring 2 players, but only one PC. One player is the VR \"user\" tasked with infiltrating an enemy space vessel, the other PC player is the \"AI\" who is tasked with aiding the \"user\" in their goals.</p>\n<p>The prompt for this game jam was \"One Tool Many Uses\" this was interpreted in the relationship between the \"user\" and the \"AI\". The VR player must rely on the PC player as a tool to help them hack, recharge, and ping as they move through the spaceship to the bridge. The PC player assumes the role of an AI tool with multiple functions that is required to complete the short experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af242ba2f9be264aeb17305d6f87c6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dennarb"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
