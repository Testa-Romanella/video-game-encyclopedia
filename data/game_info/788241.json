There is also some objects that can be destroyed. And what better way to do it then... Well... PUNCHING STUFF! Punch your way through each room and get to the teleporter. Over time your hunger bar goes down and if you get hit by enemies or their bullets it will decrease as well. Eat food to fill your hunger bar. If your hunger goes down to 0 you fall asleep and either start at the beginning of the level or a checkpoint.</p><p><strong>***NEW DEMO VERSION 2***</strong></p><ul><li>Controller Support</li><li>Credits Screen</li><li>Options (Fullscreen/Windowed &amp; Volume/Mute)</li><li>Tutorial Level so you know how to play.
