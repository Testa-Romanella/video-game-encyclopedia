The story behind it:\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this 2 Control-Points map, you will fight in Vishkar Foundation and Academy, on top of a moutain and under a waterfall. Inspired by centuries-old doctrine of Vastu Shastra, Vishkar Foundation and Academy is in a U form, standing on a dark lake. Anyone can usually enter it, visit its Temple and Shrine, but only a handful of selected students can enter the Academy Reception and then the Academy itself, nested under the waterfall. <br/></p>\n<p>Overwatch has discovered that Vishkar and Talon have been working together. They send a team in the Foundation in order to take innocent children out of Vishkar's grasp, and also to collect data about both Talon and Vishkar. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can visit Vishkar's Foundation and Academy at the time being</strong> but not play in it because we are not Blizzard. <br/></p>\n<p>This is purely fan-made, no money was earn on it.<br/></p>\n<p>Narrative and Level Design / Integration: Oc\u00e9ane Kressmann</p>\n<p>3D Modeling and Artistic Direction: M\u00e9lusine Wagner<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69ab38aef93e1df67587bf72a25a108c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sinemelu", "Ki0c"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
