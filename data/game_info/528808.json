Race your favourite dinos against one another, switching lanes to avoid obstacles, and eating yummy power-ups. But make sure your dino doesn't eat the wrong kind of food or your final power-up won't be very powerful. It's a mad dash for the finish line as you race through different worlds on your way to dino victory!<br/><br/>In each round, your dino races one-by-one against three other dinos. When you're faster than your opponents you unlock new racing dinos. After an easy start, you'll soon find yourself up against bigger, faster, stronger dinosaurs that are more challenging to beat. You can race: Tyrannosaurus rex, Troodon, Spinosaurus, Incisivosaurus, <br/>Brachiosaurus, Futalognkosaurus, Dromaeosaurus, Stegosaurus, Diabloceratops, Nanuqsaurus, and Woolly Mammoth!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T03:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5ab7f8f91993dd06933a8c7f842f439_2inJ9Kf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "genres": ["Racing", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Sinking Ship Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
