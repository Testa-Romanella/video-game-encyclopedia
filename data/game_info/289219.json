What that means is that it is a short game, that perhaps can't do a lot of features or perhaps does some features very inefficiently but I am learning and developing my skills. I had a great plan for this game with a massive story and lots of features but as development went on I realised I still lacked the skills necessary to make my dreams a reality. One day I will.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game will follow my journey either via Twitteror YouTube.</p>\n<p>Thank you and I look forward to reading your comments (good and bad!)</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the thank you notes:</p>\n<p>Thank you to Tomislav Arts one of my good friends who helped with art issues and play tested for me - check out his twitter\u00a0https://twitter.com/tomislavartz\u00a0- he is the best artist. - his Instagram\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/jtomislav/</p>\n<p>Thank you to Cade!
