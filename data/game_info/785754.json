{"id": 785754, "slug": "asl-trainer", "name": "ASL Trainer", "name_original": "ASL Trainer", "description": "<p>A trainer for ASL to help you practice the alphabet, and a few phrases.</p>\n<p>Includes:</p>\n<p>-A decipher mode - Try to translate a piece of ASL into regular speech<br/></p>\n<p>-A speech mode - Use an \"ASL keyboard\" to try to converse in ASL, there are multiple answers per question<br/></p>\n<p>-A phrase mode - a multiple choice answer mode that includes phrases<br/></p>\n<p>-Weird hands that either fly by the screen or spontaneously flop on the ground just to disappear into thin air, a sad existence truly</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Most of everything is controlled with the mouse. Settings can be accessed via the Escape key and the gear icon in the top right corner. Help can be found with the \"?\" icon in the top left. For decipher mode and speech mode, use the confirmation icon in the bottom left corner to check your answer, depending on the sound you will know if it's right or wrong (HINT: pressing the Enter key will do the same thing as this button)<br/></p>\n<p>Sidenotes:<br/>The difficulty has no real bearing, it's just what we think of each mode and how hard it is to complete questions. You can change the video resolution, I recommend 1920x1080 or 1600x900. If you experience lag, try turning off the hands in general settings. Please don't be afraid to use the Help button, this isn't a contest and no score is being kept. Some systems seem to report this app as malicious, we have no clue why this is. Credits can be found in the zip file. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T20:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e53f98701da297a2d4b02175f6277558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EverettHSGames"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
