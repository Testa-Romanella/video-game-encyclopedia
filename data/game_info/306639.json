Inspired by the Cuboid game.<br/></p>\n<p>The game can be controlled using the arrow, enter and escape keys alone. The mouse can additionally be used to rotate the camera, and R resets the level.</p>\n<p>The gameplay should be fairly straightforward; navigate the die to the green tile to advance to the next level. Certain tiles are marked with a die symbol; you can only land on them if your bottom face has the matching number. If you get stuck, press escape to go to the menu, and select \"reset level\" or \"skip level\", or go to the main menu and choose \"select level\".</p>\n<p>If you complete a level within a certain preset number of moves, you can \"star\" the level, as indicated on the level select screen. Whether you have exceeded the number of moves to star a level is indicated by the star icon in the top right turning from solid to outlined.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to use a game controller with a directional pad. The thumbsticks are ignored at this time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T05:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a162bf7c27592c01c64a778797ae1ac3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["rdb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
