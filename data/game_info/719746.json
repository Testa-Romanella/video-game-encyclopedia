{"id": 719746, "slug": "wod-supplemental-zine-collection", "name": "WoD - Supplemental Zine Collection", "name_original": "WoD - Supplemental Zine Collection", "description": "<p>World of Dungeons is a fun, minimalist, OSR-style RPG created by John Harper that's available for free! I\u00a0just threw together a couple supplemental zines inspired by WoD.\u00a0Each zine includes a front and back which\u00a0can be printed on one sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper.</p>\n<p>The first zine is a series of d6 roll tables and a couple brief additional rules. It\u00a0can be used as a sleeve cover for WoD's ruleset. The second zine is a short list of barely tested encounters that are sure to kill your player's characters.</p>\n<p>You do not require World of Dungeons to make use of the random tables or encounters, but they are created specifically for World of Dungeons. There is very little explicit description within the text, so where there is confusion just go with your gut and make it up as you go!</p>\n<p>I do not own the rights to John Harper's World of Dungeons. This project was created merely for fun and without permission from or consultation with\u00a0John Harper. But I do recommend World of Dungeons with or without this supplemental material. It's very fun!</p>\n<p>https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:49:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/215cb2249c4b14730ef38b2d89c3651a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NameHaver"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
