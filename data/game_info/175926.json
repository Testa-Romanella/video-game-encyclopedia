The theme was \"contagious\" so I decided that your regular hero was sick but still needed to do his job. I don't know if it's actually funny, or even fun. I had a great time making it and hopefully you enjoy playing even a bit! This gave me an opportunity to use a bunch of music I've always wanted to use for a game. Huge thanks to my musician Ryan Murphy for making most of these tracks.
