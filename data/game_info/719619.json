More detailed savegames will come in the future(ammo count, picked up items etc).<br/>**Advanced AI: The AI is constantly getting better and it has a long way to become fully advanced. Right know it will see you, hear you, chase you, go crouch sometimes and sneak around to find you, if not it will rust straight to the location you were last seen. If you are still around the corner it will open fire again. If you are gone from that location, the AI will go back to its business.<br/>***Using a pistol will reduce the noise you make by about 80%. The same goes for crouch walking and aim walking. You can hide in the bushes and be invisible to the enemy for as long as you stay crouched, and the AI is not very close to you. You can perform stealth takedowns by sneaking up behind the enemy and then press \"G\". The enemy doesn't always know your position when you alert it. So if you get spotted run back and change your position as soon as possible.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9dfd90995454730c53c00677ac5cf21a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LamdaProjects"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LamdaProjects"], "esrb_rating": null}
