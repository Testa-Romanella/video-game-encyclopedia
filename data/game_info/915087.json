There aren't any touch controls(yet).<br/></p><p>One day I was thinking of making another game\u00a0 -\u00a0 which I will probably put out a prototype of once if I start to make it and then leave it to the\u00a0hellhole pile of unfinished games of mine - then realized ( for some reason ) why shouldn't I mix genres? Yes, I should mix genres. Then I realized SUPERHOT is a genre. Then I realized let's mix it with Vampire Survivors and see if it sticks. To be honest, it kinda did and kinda made almost no difference. Yet, having a chance to take a breath while also seeing the enemies spawn around you - which actually is a pretty terrible bug that I couldn't fix- and coming towards you - which actually isn't a bug but a feature- is kinda neat in my opinion.<br/><br/><br/>All of the assets are taken from OpenGameArt, as my capabilities not only lack in the side of the level-design,game design and coding, they lack in art too.
