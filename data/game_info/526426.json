You can press F to save the current time and space, including your position and the status information of all objects. The saved time and space will be displayed in the upper right corner of the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a02. The space-time can be stored three times in total. If you want to store a new space-time, then you need to delete a space-time you don't need in the upper right corner.</p>\n<p>\u00a03. You can use the mouse to click on any saved time and space to enter that time and space.</p>\n<p>\u00a04. The order of the stored time and space can be changed at will. If the order of time and space is changed, the information in the fixed time and space will be changed according to the order.The saved space-time, the space-time on the right will happen first, and the space-time on the left of the space-time you choose to return will not affect your current state, because at that point in time, the actions in the space-time on the left will happen in the future.</p>\n<p>\u00a05. Only the future time and space can affect the past time and space, because in the future time and space, the actions of the past time and space have already happened. The number below the time and space in the game indicates the index of the current time and space, and the time and space with a large number is the future of the space and time with a small number.</p>\n<p>\u00a06. In the first three levels, the color on the doorpost represents the color of the light inside the door at that time, the color on the door represents the opening conditions, and the purpose of the first three levels is to enter the fourth door.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this game is to constantly exchange the order of time and space so that past actions happen before the current time, creating paradoxes, thereby changing the current state.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The numbers under the time node remind you of the order of time. Big numbers will happen in the future of small numbers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The stored time node shows the room you are in and the color of the light in the room</strong></p>\n<p>This is another developer of this game -&gt;zZaloha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd27cf587347e16cece7d5a6983aa98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nowisee"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
