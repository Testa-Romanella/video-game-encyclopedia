It was\u00a0developed in the introductory Scripting and Programming course at CSU Chico. It does not have all the functionality of a real Crash game, just a fun little mimic. There also may be several bugs with the colliders, so please don't try to break the game on purpose.</p><p>Also, I never play PC games, so I'm not super versed in the controls... so in case you aren't either: this game uses the arrow keys or\u00a0WASD for movement, the X key is a spin attack, and space bar is jump.
