Also, follow me on twitter or tumblr for updates on this and other generators (I have big plans afoot), as well as art, art process/tutorial videos, RPG content, and much more.</p>\n<p>Find out more about me and the generator in the about page within. I'd love to hear about what you create!</p>\n<p>Art all based off items generated within.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T04:40:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5002dd1500a65e15d3569409b09140.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kes Beacon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
