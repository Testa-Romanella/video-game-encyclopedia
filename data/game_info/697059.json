Kill enemies and earn experience points to level up, get stronger, and find better weapons! Battle waves of baddies and take on the final boss, T.U.B.E. Defeat it and you win!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>You are the righteous tube that must defeat all the various tubes up to no good in your world. Kill your foes and get stronger. Enemies get stronger as you level up so you must keep moving around, gathering ammo, finding weapons, and getting any health you may need for your fight.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you get strong enough, T.U.B.E. will show its face and come after you. Defend yourself from its might and you will save your world!\r\n</p>\n<p>Of course its crony tube buddies won't let you go that easily. You may wish to proceed to play the game indefinitely once the boss is defeated. How high of a level can you get to?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bad42e7a2c7907b5a5931292aed8e8f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George Vazquez"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
