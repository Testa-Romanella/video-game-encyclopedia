You see, the three golden jalapenos, sources of massive amounts of energy, have been stolen by three mysterious figures. But be warned, they're tough. <em>Really</em> tough. It's going to take all of your might and willpower to get through this dungeon (Or maybe take a gander at that star near the entrance). I might have some info that may help you:<br/><br/>WASD/Left stick - Move around and dodge enemy attacks</p>\n<p>Shift/Right Trigger - Dash to evade enemy attacks. Be careful though, you can still get hurt.</p>\n<p>E/X - Parry. This is your main offense.\u00a0<em>Return</em> enemy attacks back to them. Almost all attacks can be parried but if you're not sure, look for a white outline. You can also parry near chests to open them. (You can also use it to turn on invincibility in the hub. Note: it's a bit janky, you have to touch the star while parrying, it doesn't respond to a parry while you are already touching it.)</p>\n<p>Click/A - Attack using your bacon dagger. It's not as strong as your parry but it can get you out of a pinch.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys/Right Stick - Move the camera to get a better view of your surrounding\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find items and keys along the way to help you on your quest to find the Golden Jalapenos but be warned, they hold immeasurable energy. You might have to make a quick\u00a0<em>return</em> to the surface after finding them all.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Nicholas Soares: Director and Programmer</p>\n<p>Colin White: Music and Sound Design</p>\n<p>Aidan McCrillis: Gameplay consultant and art</p>\n<p>Jackson Swallow: Creative Director</p>\n<p>Zaven Zeitountzian: Assistant Creative Director</p>\n<p>Caden Dillon: Loremaster and Artist</p>\n\n\n<p>Sorry for any bugs :) (The game-breaking ones are, I hope, fixed in the bug fix build)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edca66aa6bb9db13e50054a38a6bb9f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Superpig5246"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
