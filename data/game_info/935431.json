Don't be alarmed, it's still the same game and it's still playable! Just go to the \"Slide Show\" tab and hit \"Play from Start.\" Please use the back and forward arrows, don't just click on the slides.\u00a0Thanks for checking out my VN!</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: Margo experiences sleep paralysis for the first time and meets a not so normal sleep paralysis demon with not so normal desires. This short, hastily made visual novel was inspired by Espoir Du Vide\u2019s (YouTube) let\u2019s play of the visual novel \"Forcefully Yours\" (18+) created by fuzzycuffs (itch.io)/fuzzycuffsdev (Twitter).\u00a0This is not promotion, I\u2019m giving credit where credit is due.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This game is more of a prototype than a demo and is made in Google Slides. It's an idea I had that I may continue on my own or if people are interested. I wasn't planning to submit this to Yan Jam 23, but changed my mind when I was reminded of the event yesterday. It honestly looks like fun so I'm giving it a go. However, because of this, there are things I didn't get to that would have been made available when you got the third ending:\u00a0a bonus ending (nsfw and skippable if you'd rather not see it), a\u00a0bonus scene, and character concept art. I'll update the VN with this bonus content\u00a0as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Content/Trigger Warnings</strong>: Adult Themes, Adult Language, Jumpscares, Loud Noises (if I get that far), Physical, Emotional, and Verbal Abuse (somewhat). This game does not contain SA or graphic imagery, however some scenes (like the opening) may be uncomfortable or triggering for some because of wording or the situations portrayed. Your wellbeing matters more to me than this game, please be safe!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T14:19:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b4197e9b4a2401ed5b9d7a5ea7646425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sleep13bro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
