With cruel precision and reckless abandon they felled trees beyond counting, turning the lush forest into a blasted wasteland. What little green remains is being crushed underfoot and drowned in ashen rain. The nature spirits of this place must escape to other lands before it is too late...</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Fading Light</em></strong> is a reverse tower defense where you build waves of forest denizens, draw the path they will take, and protect them from enemies and traps as they walk the gauntlet to the end. Gameplay proceeds in three phases: the Planning Phase, where you build your wave of creeps and select their path; Creep Phase, where you cast spells to protect the creeps as they go; and the Attack Phase, where you bring the fight to the despoilers and hamper their efforts. Get victory points and win by bringing enough creeps safely to the end!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse and keyboard required for play, although a touch pad may stand in for a mouse (but is not recommended). A single match takes about 5-10 minutes. Beat a match on higher difficulties to see the victory screen change!<br/></p>\n<p>Fading Light is still in development and I expect to make a few major updates to it before I consider it complete! Please have patience; I am a solo developer who makes games as a hobby and I choose to develop at a leisurely pace. <strong>Planned features include:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>More types of towers, creeps, spells, pickups, and/or modifiers</li><li>A procedural/semi-random map generator</li><li>Art improvements to aid in readability and environmental storytelling</li><li>Quality-of-life and control improvements</li></ul><p>Follow development of Fading Light on my dev blog! I try to write about interesting things about once every couple weeks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T06:28:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14dbf08471d58896bfc25afbe8eee5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Symbiotic Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
