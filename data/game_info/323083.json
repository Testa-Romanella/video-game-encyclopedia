The survivors must escape the grotesque experiment taking place onboard the decaying 1970s era sea fortress, all the while evading the horrors within.<br />\n\u200bPlayers will have to think on their feet and adapt to a dynamic, open-ended horror playground. It\u2019s down to you how you tactically exploit the different environmental and gameplay challenges generated with each playthrough, regardless of whether you\u2019re playing as the survivors, or as one of the deadly oceanic monstrosities hunting them down.<br />\n\u200bThere are countless solutions to the ever-changing obstacles in Monstrum 2, whether you\u2019re using scavenged items to access hidden routes; brutally smashing through destructible objects; climbing the environment to ambush your prey; working cooperatively with your fellow survivors to reach important equipment, or going solo and hiding to stealthily avoid detection.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T18:22:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be6f9e68c8bd011f2d92cae61697b45d.jpg", "website": "http://monstrumgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 44, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Junkfish"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Junkfish"], "esrb_rating": null}
