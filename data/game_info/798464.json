Hell, even the planet is stationary at (0, 0, 0) to enable me to take dirty shortcuts everywhere else, <em>the universe is literally revolving around the planet.</em> Movement is cheated by using two pivot points and rotating them, to avoid time consuming quaternion math and bugs, so it's in practice a 2D sidescroller.\u00a0<em><strong>It's all about efficiency, lol.</strong></em></p><p>-</p><p>Credits for the assets that I didn't make myself:</p>\n<p><strong>- PBR copper/steel materials</strong> - [3DTextures.me](https://3dtextures.me)</p>\n<p><strong>- Soundtrack -</strong> YouTube Audio Library</p>\n<p><strong>- Fonts - </strong>Google Fonts</p>\n<p><strong>- Plate and earth cracking SFX, crowd screaming SFX - </strong>[Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)</p>\n<p>\"SharedArrayBuffer\" version, <strong>does not work in Firefox.</strong>\u00a0Link to the <strong>gotm.io</strong> version, their player should work.
