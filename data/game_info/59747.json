In a robo-civilization. <strong>My name sealed my fate.</strong> A lifetime adventure was in my destiny. In 1944, a nazi robot legion was sent to conquer my world, using a time machine. The nazi expedition was a success and my robot-girlfriend (a rogirl) was kidnapped. I tried to defend her by the evil nazis! But I even lost one of his eyes in the fight.
