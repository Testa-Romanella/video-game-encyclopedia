There are 5 colors with different effects:<br/>- Red: Bouncy<br/>- Blue: Shrinking<br/>- Yellow: Sticking to walls<br/>- Purple: Faster movement<br/>- Orange: Reverse gravity<br/>- Green: Blocks become intangible</p>\n<p>White blocks react to all colors, colored blocks only to their color, and black blocks to none. Unfortunately we ran out of time and ended up with only one half finished level ;)</p>\n<p>Enjoy!
