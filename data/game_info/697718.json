Think of it as Portal in 2D, with a more action focused gameplay and the ability to create portal everywhere, with every inclination.<br/><br/>It was fun to code and to mess around, but impossible to use it for puzzle as it was a too gamebreaking power. </p>\n<p>Credits: The name and designs are for a vast part, property of Ankama. I am not affiliated with them in any shape or form, and they don't have anything to do with this prototype. Sprites from the multi platformer tileset were used. The main character sprite and animations are based on a template of Korigan457.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T04:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/11718308d20a6a31d20a31d363e5ee40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pordrack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
