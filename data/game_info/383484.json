It features 2 parts. The first part, <em>Into Darkness</em>, is a personal narrative of mine, portraying my journey of finding faith and escaping persecution. The second part, <em>Storm and Rain</em>, is meant to be an extension of my message set in a rainy dark woods. It is however, unfinished - due to time limit of the semester. In this project, I attempt to explore the graphic capability of Unity, experimenting with different shaders and post-processing effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5d3830d86d0f25ecaef97d67d10d03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeoTheCatMeow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
