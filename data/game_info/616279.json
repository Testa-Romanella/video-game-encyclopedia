Player 1 is controlled by wasd + space keys\u00a0 to cast card combinations. Player 2 is controlled by ijkl + space to cast card combinations. Your cards are shown in inventory on the bottom right. Once a player has filled their inventory with three cards, they must cast a spell before collecting more cards. The guide to all of the possible card combinations is on the bottom left of the screen. The pitfall aspect was incorporated into the game\u2019s environment, with a pitfall being located in the forest portion of the map. The game ends when a player's health reaches 0 or falls into the pit.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game</p>\n<p>Best</p>\n<p>Creator: Jessica Huang, Aaron Wu, ZhiBin Huang</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:43:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/541056d79066fd2bf4ef4c9f31456d2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ZHIBIN"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
