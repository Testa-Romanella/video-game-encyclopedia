My art skills are real hotdogwater but it was still fun trying to make this in one week and succeeding.</p>\n<p>Also this Game is not a Virus but virus scanner may detect it as one so maybe turn anti virus programs off for the game or make exceptions for the game. But if you do keep in mind that I made the Project in own exe files. But it should be easy enough to look through and decide which one you need to make an exception for.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T09:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef299c0e89c035956c72bb290cc5513.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PegaMega"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
