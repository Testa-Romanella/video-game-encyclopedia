I was never socially  inarticulate. Not a loner. And that saved my life, saved my sanity. That  and the writing. But to this day I distrust anybody who thought this  game was a good a idea.\u00a0\r\n \r\n~Stephen King\r\n \r\nI became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. This game is one of those intervals.\u00a0\r\n \r\n~Edgar Allan Poe\r\n \r\nGreat kid, don't get cocky!\u00a0\r\n \r\n~Han Solo\r\n \r\nWhen you are talking about, 'I will lose my sanity for real,' that's  when it's time to move on but you can't because there's no return to  main menu screen.\r\n \r\n~Travis Kalanick\r\n \r\nI had a quick grasp of the secret to sanity, it had become the  ability to hold the maximum of impossible combinations in one's mind but  Bonbon kept going left so that secret is long gone!\u00a0\r\n \r\n~ Norman Mailer\r\n \r\nWhat are you still doing reading this go play the game\r\n ~\u00a0James G,\u00a0Ken\u00a0V, Sean\u00a0P", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:41:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a427338def1192df5a0ffae98f0aedfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicholas5l", "DPlummer187", "JamesGottago"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
