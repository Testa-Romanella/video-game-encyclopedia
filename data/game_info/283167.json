But have you ever thought the amount of planning, resources and work that goes into that friendly police man patrolling or reaching his station in time. It is years and years of planning and experience and it needs to be adjusted to changing times.<br/><br/>Mountains are great too - but they have windy roads, treacherous paths and dark valleys. They are great if you are tourist but it can be hard if you have to live there for longer periods. If you are a cop posted on a hill station, you need to be even more diligent.<br/><br/>You know what else is great - buses and driving buses on mountains. And here's the cherry on top: you get to drive the bus and pick and drop cops from one station to another. Serving the community and having the thrill of a life time. Yeah we know, no more words from us. Jump right in and do lets us know how the ride was.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28f/28f5a77c155b57327936ee1db0af6984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["elinx technologies"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["elinx technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
