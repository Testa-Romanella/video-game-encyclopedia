As the days passed by he could not stop questioning whether they might be right or not. Markus remembered reading an article in his local newspaper about a man being haunted in his own apartment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They portrayed it as a fake because obviously ghosts and paranormal activities don\u00b4t exist, right? Maybe Markus wasn\u00b4t the only one wondering about what could possibly happen next. He told himself he had no reason for believing these fairy tales until he got overwhelmed by his concerns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last thing Markus remembers is waking up in his bathroom with a serious hangover.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It also seems like there are some odd noises outside the door but he could not remember giving his neighbours a key to his apartment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt nervousness rising up in him. He needed to contact the guy he read about in the newspaper as soon as possible but... all of Markus\u00b4belongings are outside the bathroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Note</strong></p>\n<p>Previous Tenant is currently still in alpha release we are working on finishing the level, but in the meantime it is playable in its current state.</p>\n<p>Since it's our first game, don't be too hard on us.</p>\n<p>Solutions and hints are currently only available through our website, we are still working on the ingame hints system.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Could be found here</strong>\u00a0https://tako-games.net/hints\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:53:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b8a8eff6870c4bf08f8866dd63b3f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tako_games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
