So when deciding to make my first game I wanted to make my own version of this classic. Bricks are stationary, unbreakable, move along the X-axis, move up and move down. These last two use all you remaining lives if they disappear from the screen.</p><p>The game also takes inspiration from early 20th century architecture (Aalto, Mies Van Der Rowe etc), Sci-Fi and video games from the 80's and 90's. I wanted to strip this designs down to their bare bones and show how they influenced each other.</p><p>Starting with 25 levels I intend to add more and release on other platforms such as Windows and Apple AppStore.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c15e27ddfc66d67d251436947cf09f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hut41"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
