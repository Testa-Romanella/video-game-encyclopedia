However, Zorg's love for cheese quickly turns into an obsession, and he sets his sights on a much bigger prize - the moon! To reach the moon, Zorg must navigate through different levels of increasing difficulty, avoiding obstacles and collecting as much cheese as he can along the way. In each level, Zorg must use his alien powers, such as levitation and laser beams, to overcome challenges and outsmart the humans who stand in his way. As Zorg progresses through the game, he becomes more and more determined to steal the moon, but the humans are not going to let him get away with it that easily. They set up traps, call in reinforcements, and try to capture Zorg before he can complete his mission. The game features colorful graphics, fun gameplay, and plenty of challenging levels to keep players engaged. As Zorg, you must use your wit and cunning to steal the moon and prove to the humans that you are the ultimate cheese thief alien!</p>\n\n<p>Were sorry for the audio. we have a downloadable version, with a few fixes, but we were too late to upload it.</p>\n<p>We used pygame with pygbag to make this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T15:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/099/099a5e881c5b6634855669239c3067ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GuineaPigMart"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
