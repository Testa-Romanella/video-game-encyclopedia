When night finally creeps in, you must complete the final ritual; send as many falling star fragments as possible back to the night sky.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Starcaller will launch with 30 unique puzzles, 10 different walls each with 3 tiers of difficulty and additionally randomized to ensure that every time you play its a new experience! Puzzle tasks range from figuring our celestial patterns, realigning symbols on rotating discs, and memorizing musical notes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We will be updating Starcaller regularly with events, bug fixes, new puzzles, new game modes and more. Smaller updates will be free, larger content packs may come as paid DLC. You can follow our development progress on our Discord and Trello!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T02:26:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e1fc770bd1ca0119c34592dc379268.jpg", "website": "https://www.monarchgamestudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmic Wheels", "Monarch Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monarch Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
