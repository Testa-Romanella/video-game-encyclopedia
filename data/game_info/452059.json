What's Your Number is a choose-your-own adventure game where the draft and a 20-sided die choose your adventures for you. The game presents different scenarios that take players' decision making away from them so they contemplate the importance of voting and what one can do when you don't have that power. It also serves as a reminder of the lessons of the Kent State Shootings and the crisis of militarized enforcement. <br/></p>\n<p>This Twine game was made as part of Global Game Jam 2020 and in coordination with the Kent State May 4th Visitor's Center.
