Today, April 14th 2457, is a day that the history books will not forget. The once prosperous relations between the United Nations and Colonies of Earth and the Silerian Planetary League have been destabilising for years. After the incident that led to the loss of the UNS Gr\u00e9goire, the two largest fleets of warships ever assembled gathered to face each other in uncertainty around the uninhabited and frozen world of Cyrass 239d, whilst our diplomats met aboard the luxury liner Pearlescent for one final attempt to forge lasting peace between our peoples. They have failed. And as of this moment, for the first time in living memory, we are at war.\"</p>\n<p>With those fateful words, a war began that would last almost half a century.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a 3D strategy game where you command fleets of warships in that war. Barely a taste of what is to come for this series and this game, this initial version features only skirmish mode. In the future, we intend to give you full control over the war via a dynamic and ever changing map of local territories, as you harness the resources of a galaxy.</p>\n<p>Please, try our game and donate generously - and the full and heavily plot based campaign will soon become a reality. And do give as much feedback as you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c44122666b0a7c0b3ef6dd553c3a3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuantumNexus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
