Bent on leaving his mark, Lupin launches himself into the past to prevent history\u2019s greatest geniuses from completing their defining works, so HE can complete them instead. <br/><br/>Now the very fabric of time is beginning to unravel, and it\u2019s up to Kelvin and his fellow research assistant Lise to repair it. Point and click your way through three wacky, gorgeously drawn chapters to help Ludwig van Beethoven, Isaac Newton, and Leonardo da Vinci achieve their destined greatness!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d1771e1dae9c4ee15245e445862f081e.jpg", "website": "http://www.infamousmachine.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Blyts"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Blyts", "Martin Clasen"], "esrb_rating": null}
