Chase the abilities that excite you. Try something different next time.</strong></li><li><strong>Each run strives to deliver a new experience. Your enemies spawn at strange and varied rates.</strong></li><li><strong>Each run strives to deliver a reliable experience. The game is focused on one thing: your struggle to survive a threatening landscape &amp; its inhabitants.</strong></li><li><strong>Everything that lives in the pit is designed to be dangerous and unique.</strong></li><li><strong>As you go deeper, the game goes through pulsating waves of increased difficulty.\u00a0Things get very different after 1km. </strong><em>(I rarely get this far. Honestly, the game may be a bit too hard? But if you're into that kind of thing, it's so satisfying to overcome the uncompromising obstacles that stand in your way.)</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Listen to:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>The layered soundtrack that shifts as the pit reveals itself to you.</strong></li><li><strong>The siren that screams as danger mounts.</strong></li><li><strong>An album full of remixes.</strong>\u00a0https://jmickle.bandcamp.com/album/probability-zero-remixed</li></ul>\n<p><strong>There is no bottom.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Every run ends in death.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dive again.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349e19f11ea5db43ca4ef36c36b5da1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Droqen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
