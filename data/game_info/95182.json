Gamepads are also supported.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The goal is to get to the 25th floor and defeat an enemy there, so plan accordingly.</li><li>Your starting equipment will very quickly need to be upgraded.</li><li>Passive effects for weapons may be more useful than additional strength.</li><li>Some passives effect positioning and can help you from getting cornered.</li><li>There are no boots in the game currently. Enjoy walking in the grass barefoot.</li><li>Get a sense for the room before running straight in. Some enemies can kill you pretty easily in\u00a01x1 hallways.</li><li>Explore the room carefully for easy enemies that drop edible items and items scattered around.</li><li>Falling down a hole will damage you and also let the enemies take a turn. On harder floors this can do a lot of damage.</li><li>Move slowly.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Web (or Mobile) Player:</strong></p>\n<p>You can play the web version here:\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2034</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c9b41835ca7a2029ecf1369a18ec6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cow"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
