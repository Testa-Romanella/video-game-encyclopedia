Use the stance system to eliminate random chance in battle, but at a price. <br/><br/><br/>Battle damage is persistent across maps. Your units and resources are finite. You'll have to live with the results of the decisions you make at the beginning.<h3>The Stance System</h3>The stance system can be used to change the odds of a situation and address frustration born of random hit chances, but with a penalty. There are 3 stances:<br/><br/><br/><strong>Cautious stance</strong><ul><li>Unit evasion percentage is it's chance to evade damage</li></ul><strong>Reckless stance</strong><ul><li>Target's evasion percentage is now attack damage reduction<br/></li><li>Unit cannot be evaded<br/></li><li>Unit cannot evade<br/></li><li>Unit takes more damage</li></ul><strong>Defender stance</strong><ul><li>Unit takes damage to energy points before hit points<br/></li><li>Unit cannot evade<br/></li><li>Unit cannot attack<br/></li><li>Units cannot attack or restore without energy points</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T03:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e12bda33e7854b2d640388f2a8d7cefc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Setso Botswana Pty"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Setso Botswana Pty"], "esrb_rating": null}
