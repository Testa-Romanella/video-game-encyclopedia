Now playable in browser!</p>\n<p>You can also download a mac or windows version if you prefer. Personally, I do think the downloaded version plays better.</p>\n<p>When you're in the game, you can press \"r\" to reset and \"q\" to return to the menu. You no longer need the mouse for that!</p>\n<p>My highscore starting at 1x speed\u00a0is 1694. If you have fun, let me know yours!</p>\n<p>Major changes from Alpha 1:</p>\n<p>- Removed third person camera mode. I mostly heard that first person mode was easier and more fun. I can restore a third person camera at any time if people think it was fun.</p>\n<p>- Added the option to set the game speed multiplier before playing, so you can go right into the high speed chaos of the game.</p>\n<p>- Gave the player a fluid movement motion, as opposed to the player simply teleporting to the direction's destination.</p>\n<p>- Added a text in the upper right to show the game speed multiplier below the score. Now players can know just how fast they were going when they biffed it.</p>\n\n<p>Changes to be done before Alpha 3:</p>\n<p>- Still trying to make the movement feel better. (STILL WORKING ON IT, BUT IT'S BETTER)</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Once you're at around 3x speed, you can sometimes go right through obstacles without crashing. So, you know, I\u00a0should probably fix that\u00a0:P (FIXED IN ALPHA 2.1)</p>\n<p>- Make the obstacles more varied</p>\n<p>- Maybe some sound or simple music?</p>\n<p>- A reset / main menu\u00a0hotkey, so you don't need to use the mouse (ADDED IN ALPHA 2.2)</p>\n<p>- I feel like I'm disproportionately dying to high obstacles starting around 2.6x speed, but I can't tell if there's a problem or if I\u00a0just suck at that speed (IT WAS A PROBLEM THAT I FIXED IN ALPHA 2.2)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62b/62bf3b7493f9249810626ae4ffae49df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["xandotoaster"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
