Race your way around 12 different real life oval circuits, testing your skills in a field of 16 drivers based on real life racers. Aim for the Chequered Flag and let nothing stand in your way! Multiple games modes include the career mode which features more than 100 races as you work your way through the grades to become champion of each circuit. The new engine behind Bangers Unlimited 2 allows for both physical and mechanical damage, meaning you must nurse your car to the finish line while removing opponents from your path to glory. The skill level of your AI opponents adjusts as you proceed and succeed, meaning there is always a challenge, whether you are an occasional racer or more regular player.  You can also open other game modes as you make your way through the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/aca858eadd622d06193ad13d47cc65ad_ABQroqD.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Madcowie Productions", "Stuart Cowie"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Stuart Cowie"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
