The goal is to push all of the boxes to the targets that are scattered around each level. That's it! It's easy! But not really! It's fun to play though! Until you get to the hard levels! Then you just spend a lot of time looking at the neat lighting effects!</p>\n<p><strong>This game is currently in development and is not of a quality that I would consider \"final\".</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is currently fully playable but is lacking many\u00a0(both game and user experience) features I would like to include in the final product. The game is not abandoned but is currently on hold while I work on other projects (mainly school).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8df/8df0ef3b6ce132c493929e90f121327c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alex Cot\u00e9"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
