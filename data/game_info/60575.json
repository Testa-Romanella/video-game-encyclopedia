Gather a team of friends and get an unforgettable battle of cakes underway! For the very bravest player there are battles against AI players, with different levels of difficulty available (you can always call your mom or dad for help!).<br/><br/><strong>Game Rules</strong><br/><br/>Jolly Battle is played using the rules of the classic game Battleship. The players do battle with a fleet of funny animated cakes. Firepower is brought to bear through caramel bombs, which zero in on the cakes that the players take aim at. Players take turns to attack. So choose where to place your fighting cakes and try to \u2018chow down\u2019 on the enemy fleet faster than it can devour your own!<br/> <br/><strong>Game Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Simple, classic rules<br/></li><li>Attractive graphics<br/></li><li>Entertaining soundtrack</li></ul> <br/><strong>Developers</strong><br/><br/>The indie development team nurtures and cherishes its projects like they were their own children.
