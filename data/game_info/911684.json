This would allow me to change attributes of these 'pops' and how they interacted with eachother, which would in turn mirror the disease's spread.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I split the United Kingdom into 8 sections, designating seperate regions each running their own simulations.</p>\n<p>The player must manage various responses per region, all while sticking to a budget. These responses consist of a Testing level, for example, which designates what percentage of the symptomatic population is considered infected in the statistics the player has access to.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first significant project, developed in Python using the 'pygame' visual library. It is somewhat lacking in aesthetic consideration, and was a natural next course in the project's development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would be interested in returning to the idea, producing a significantly more in-depth simulation in which the player could observe how a disease spreads in a smaller community.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f196c55960e17c20f842feb337a4eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Hutchinson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
