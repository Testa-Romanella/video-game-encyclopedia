It's called 'the ultimate object lesson'.<br/>\nThe game is called 'Project Aes Sedai: Embedded'. It's designed with the making of it in mind. The game is so simple you just need a pen and paper. The game takes you to the past, present and future. It is, without doubt, the ultimate object lesson.\n\nHere's how it works. You'll construct an object from the scraps of you and your friends' previous lives. You live in an endless current, where nothing moves. Could this animation be anywhere near the real world?\n\nThe only problem is, 'all the time' doesn't hold up to scrutiny. If you go back to your previous life, you'll miss the most recent episode of the show you watched forty years ago.\n\n\"It's all about having a wide-ranging view and doing just that,\" says Outhouse Media's CEO Rob Henshaw. \"It has a very organic and fun feel to it.\"\n\nWhile the game itself lacks any direct interactive control, your friends will be able to create their own enclaves with objects, or get to know a world of their own.\n\nOne of the most fascinating features of this game is the ability to effectively speak directly to the objects in the environment. As you play, you'll interact with objects, talking to them and manipulating them, scheming with them, experimenting with them, whispering with them, and even talking to them</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T05:39:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54ff5a79b209c94646f5dd8fcc056a1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
