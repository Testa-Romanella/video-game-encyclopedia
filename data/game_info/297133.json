Build sets, control the actors, write their dialogue and record with the camera to create the film of your dreams.</p>\n<p>The game use the Text-To-Speech voices available on your own computer via your operating system. You can download additional voices by adding more languages via your language settings.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype developed by Flamebait Games meaning that it's not a full game experience and that it's a bit (read 'very') rough around the edges. The purpose is to evaluate the core concept so, if you like it make sure to let us know! Otherwise we may not continue development for a full game.</p>\n<p>Make sure to join our Discord!\u00a0https://discord.gg/flamebaitgames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f4ef3cbd6e67468470681d327463dac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flamebait"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
