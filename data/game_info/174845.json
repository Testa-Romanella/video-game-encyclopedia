{"id": 174845, "slug": "jump-the-gap", "name": "Jump the Gap", "name_original": "Jump the Gap", "description": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Jump the Gap is a small, single level game created by two amateur game developers over the course of two months. This game served primarily as a means for the creators to practice and learn the basics of implementing a basic platformer game. The game consists of an opening splash screen and a single level with 100 collectable coins. The characters featured in the game are named Elizabeth and Benjamin, a pair of joey.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n<br/>Jump the Gap supports both keyboard and controller interface.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Basic Movement</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Start = Enter / Space or Start / A-button (only on Start screen)</li><li>Left / Right = keyboard arrows, left joystick or d-pad\r\n  </li><li>Jump = Space Bar or A-button\r\n  </li><li>Super Jump = Up arrow or Right Trigger\r\n  </li><li>Character Swap = \"C\" key or B-button\u00a0\r\n  </li><li>Exit Game = Esc key (after intro screen)</li></ul>\n<p>Change active characters by pressing the Swap button.<br/></p>\n<p>You can perform wall-jumps by holding in the direction of a wall and pressing the jump button.<br/></p>\n<p>Each character has a unique \"Super Jump\" which will allow them to reach higher or longer distances. When performing either Super Jump, be aware that your controls will be limited until you land again.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Touching a Checkpoint Flag will allow you to restart at the checkpoint rather than the start of the level.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you get hit 3 times, you will need to restart at either the beginning or your last Checkpoint. There are 100 \"Clams\" to collect in the level. See if you can find them all!</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong><br/>The wall jumping animation sometimes bugs out but doesn't affect the performance of the move. The AI is also very bad and will try its best to keep up but will likely get stuck somewhere. Don't worry, it will pop back to you eventually. The game seems to lag when played on non-standard resolution monitors (we have no clue why).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Animation &amp; Design:</strong><br/>Christopher Cypress\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Programming &amp; Implementation:</strong><br/>Alexander Catinella\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Engine used:</strong><br/>GameMaker Studio 2\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects Sources</strong><br/>\"Ouch\" - http://freesound.org/people/OwlStorm/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\"Jump\" - http://freesound.org/people/Cabeeno%20Rossley/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\"Coin\" - http://freesound.org/people/ProjectsU012/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\"Super Jump\" - http://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\"Start\" sound - https://opengameart.org/content/ui-accept-or-forward\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Background Music \"Darenventure\" from \"Dork is Yes!\"</strong><br/>album by mathgrant - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/mathgrant/\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a04/a045f641ddcfb94172fe7d388dfbe2aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aoshi Stark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
