{"id": 52758, "slug": "bubsy-3d", "name": "Bubsy 3D", "name_original": "Bubsy 3D", "description": "<p>Bubsy 3D (also Bubsy Is 3D in Furbitten Planet and Bubsy 3D: Furbitten Planet) is a platform video game developed by Eidetic and published by Accolade for the PlayStation video game console. Designed by Michael Berlyn, the game was released on November 25, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. A Sega Saturn version was planned for release, but was ultimately cancelled. It is the fourth game in the Bubsy series as well as the first and only Bubsy game in 3D. The game's complete name is a play on words in reference to Forbidden Planet, a 1956 sci-fi film. Lani Minella voices all characters in the game, including Bubsy.</p>\n<p>While 3D video games have existed years before its release, Bubsy 3D was one of the games that contributed to the ascendancy of the genre. Bubsy 3D received mostly negative reviews, with heavy criticism going towards the game's controls, camera, voice acting and personality of the main character. The game has attracted infamy, and is often listed as one of the worst video games of all time.</p>\n<p>The series went dormant for decades after the game's release, not receiving a follow up until Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back was released in 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-25T02:48:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a1/8a1643d504b4a3c99cff0a968a47727e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["SIE Bend Studio", "Eidetic"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Accolade"], "esrb_rating": null}
