It wiped out nearly the entirety of the human race. The rest were converted to mutations which started kill the survivors and, oddly enough, also started to destroy buildings. You are one of the few lucky survivors. You decide to try and survive until you meet another human being, to try and allow the human race another chance to survive. To survive, you will need a house, but you are not smart enough to figure out how to build a house. After traveling for a long time, you finally find an undestroyed building. However, mutations have noticed you and have decided to try and destroy the house! To ensure the continuation of the human race, you must protect the building at  all costs!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22d/22d9841c82d486182d92a928a4fcfd05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["foreverip"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
