But be quick--the money must flow!</p><p>This is an 'exponential growth' type game with a hint of speedrunning. How much money can you earn before the timer runs out? Can you achieve the A rank? The S rank? (Even more... ?)</p><p>Made by me in a little over one day for MiniJam 123, where the theme was \"Web\" (didn't really use that much. At some point in the planning process it was going to be spiders running the factory, but didn't have nearly enough time to do that), and the limitation was \"There is no ground\". There's no sound because I didn't have time to add sound!</p><p>Made with Godot and Aseprite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/053/0533ead977cebeb004ecaff41c9456a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheJackOfClubs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
