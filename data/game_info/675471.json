Using his big muscles, do your best to traverse the rickety and frail old mines.<br/><br/>It is a game made right in my wheelhouse, a puzzle/action platformer with retro graphics made for what I call \"the NES Pro\". It is short and might be slightly clunky but I'm hoping everything is clear and fun enough that you'll make it to the end. It's not a long game regardless\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50Version Differences\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Jam version has no audio except for 1 very loud beep when you grab crates.<strong> I do not recommend playing that version but if you do, please find a way to mute the game window before starting.</strong> I'm very sorry</li><li>Post Jam version is identical to the Jam one gameplay wise, but I have decorated the last 3 levels a little bit more and have\u00a0added SFX and Music that can be controlled in the options menu. I have opted out of Audio in the Jam, so if you want to play this version keep these changes in mind in the rating.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50<strong>Controls</strong>\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50</p>\n\r\nMove with arrows/DPad.
