Slaves? Gladiators? Everyone is running around butt naked? What? Watch this story unfold alongside iconic figures like Spartacus, Crixus, Batiatus ... And many more. Be careful though, the average lifespan is only 35 years old. It's survival of the fittest out here. You have to make a choice, do you stay in those times, risking your life for fame and glory? Or do you turn away and go back home to your loving wife?<br/> <br/>  Rebellion: The Beginning is a story-based Visual Novel in which the player has to fight for his life and to either stay and watch the rebellion unfold or turn back to his time, ending the game. In Ancient Rome, the player can only trust other gladiators such as himself and Spartacus. The player can use his knowledge of the future to alter the events of the past.<br/> <br/>  We are proud of our huge character cast, beautiful women and thrilling fight scenes, engaging storytelling and lots of nudity. The sexual content is to fap for, but, I will let you decide all that for yourself. Please enjoy the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T09:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae984ea440c21d0ab28ee0eb0ee93ee8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AGHAMUS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["AGHAMUS"], "esrb_rating": null}
