I'm very proud and happy with the result so far and looking forward for finishing the game soon. There are still a lot of bugs which I'm trying to fix but as you all know this is a long process.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Need to say that I'm doing also the Music and Sound Design in the Game. I have have music producer background and I've written the Soundtrack especially for the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Optimization wise I think it can be better but didn't want to ruin the nice graphics so I left them very sharp and detailed even on the lowest possible setting, please if you like to have even lower setting so you can play on not so powerful computers, let me know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll be very happy if you appreciate what I've come up with and donate as much as you wish! Working on new track and more cars to be Implemented into the game, also I'm working on AI and more Race Modes. There will be Drift mode, Race Mode and much more interesting things to do.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Expect Game Jam on this game soon! Cheers and HF!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c6/8c66ddd030f101185c5ace5b45f439b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 433, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krasimir Kostadinov"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
