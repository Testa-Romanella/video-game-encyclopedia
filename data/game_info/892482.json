To accomplish this you must fight enemies and bosses alike collecting coins along the way. Fighting against the clock for the fastest time. As you progress through each level you gain an increasing arsenal of weapons to choose from depending on the class you play.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Control Instructions/ explanation of how to play\r\n</p>\n<p>[A][D] to move left and right\r\n</p>\n<p>[Q][E] to dash left and right\r\n</p>\n<p>[Space] to jump double jump and wall jump\r\n</p>\n<p>[Left Click] to use a weapon\r\n</p>\n<p>[1,2,3][Tab][Right Click]Switch weapons\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>What went right?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\tWhat we got right was the movement, controller support, combat, and art design.\u00a0 The thing that we thought worked better than expected was the balancing of the abilities of each class due to having other people playtest our game for us. Another thing that we thought went well was how the monsters would interact with the player when they are in range.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong/what problems did you face?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\tThe problems that we faced were teamwork, communication, time management. and some coding issues. We did not really try to overcome these problems, we just worked through it and made sure that progress had been made in our game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What changes were made and why?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\tWe had to cut out the tundra level that would have included a boss and a couple of new monsters to fight. However, due to poor time management, we were not able to get these done on time, so in the end, we just scrapped the idea and tried to polish what we have already done.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What did you learn?</strong>\r\n\tWe learned that it is hard to keep the team organized due to everyone having different schedules. As well as how it is important to keep everyone updated on what needs to be done so that we do not fall behind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T11:41:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0887b86bb030fc6241be79c14b4756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeffrey W", "dmohanta", "Brother_Seen", "yili32", "bcho7"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
