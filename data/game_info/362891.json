Did you really believe that those NPCs are controlled by the computer? Well, yes they are. But for this game we are going to pretend that is not the case. Instead we are going to pretend every NPC is actually controlled by an actual person. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs a player you are tasked to run a \"secret\" shop and sell items to the players of the RPG world. Buy items for cheap and sell them high. Pick up items of fallen players and sell them for a profit. Keep up with the events of the game and re-stock your shelves with what is in demand. Level up, learn new skills, upgrade your store, and perks. Grow your reputation among players and attract big boy players to earn more. Express your emotions in hand gestures. Explore the world you live in. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPurchase a blacksmith and forge unique weapons. Increase your profit by making your own weapons. Mine for materials. Become the best shop keeper in this RPG world.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6be/6be7b07bb6be4162563913339e0ee671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Odooh Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Odooh Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
