{"id": 961086, "slug": "milfvania-ep-1", "name": "Milfvania Ep. 1", "name_original": "Milfvania Ep. 1", "description": "Milfvania tells the story of a young guy who got into trouble because of a girl (Julie) recruited for an amateur porn video. As a result, he had to move abroad, somewhere in post-Soviet Europe, where he met Lidia and her two daughters. But soon after, Julie follows him, and all the wicked and devilish things she does will turn out for the best.<br/><br/><strong>Episodes can be played independently, as they each encapsulate fantasies on their own. It is a h-scene intensive (animated) game.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Adult scenes are fully animated and plenty, animated in a classical keyframe style. I try to reduce to a minimum the uncanny, robotic movement and provide a natural motion for maximum stimulus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This first episode introduces you to the Milfvania universe. It's a story about a young adult (the player) who leaves his home to live abroad in an ex-communist country. There you meet Lidia, your landlady, and her daughters, Nastya and Olga. You then have to make a living there while also enjoying the women!<br/>The sex scenes that an episode contains can be seen in the screenshot area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>post-Soviet aesthetics</li><li>focus on lewdness</li><li>ambiental music</li><li>animated sex scenes with sound</li><li>visual novel mechanic with choices</li><li>puzzle elements where you must help the girls or collaborate with them (collect objects required for the story; solve challenges)</li><li>adult scene gallery to help you see what scenes are yet to be unlocked</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Q:</strong>Why episodes? <strong>A:</strong>Based on how the game is received the story will be longer or shorter.</li><li><strong>Q:</strong>Are the episodes standalone?<strong>A:</strong>Yes, the episodes can be played independently, you don't need the save from the previous one.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-22T02:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c58769acad26065071f21bf4535f7d5.jpg", "website": "https://darkbasic.xyz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["DarkBasic"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DarkBasic"], "esrb_rating": null}
