Escape the Pyramid is a short, simple, and fun platformer! You control an archaeologist who has to escape the pyramid. Since the theme for the Wowie Jam is \"Failure is Progress\" you must jump onto the spikes to turn yourself to stone, respawn, and use your stone body as a platform! Good luck to everyone on this jam!
