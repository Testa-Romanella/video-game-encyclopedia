But Halo: Spartan Assault takes the formula and changes one element of the setting. Now players are experiencing the series through an isometric top-down twin-stick shooter. The game story takes place between Halo 3 and Halo 4, where humans and Covenant signed a ceasefire to stop the war. Through the treacherous attack that some rogue Covenant group carried out, the leadership of the aliens learns that one of the moons surrounding Draetheus V is an ancient planetary weapon. And it\u2019s up to Spartans Sarah Palmer and Davis to stop the destruction and fight back.<br />\nThe game allows players to participate in weekly challenges on top of story campaign consisting of 30 levels. All Halo weapons and transports up to the release date were added, players access armor abilities and even customize their Spartan.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2013-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-21T20:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/93f/93f10d635566ff67e4f743c2c8f2c4dd.jpg", "website": "http://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 75, "owned": 1616, "beaten": 72, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 111, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 142, "ratings_count": 213, "suggestions_count": 576, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 213, "platforms": ["iOS", "Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["343 Industries", "Microsoft", "Vanguard Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
