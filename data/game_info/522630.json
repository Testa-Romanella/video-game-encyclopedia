The Augur is completely\u00a0<strong>free\u00a0</strong>and I started a Patreon\u00a0to support its development, my patreons will get monthly content in the form of adventures, tome of foes, bestiaries, lore, world settings, and more. Everything is released in PDFs and also as modules you can load and play in The Augur.<br/><br/>I am constantly updating and adding features to The Augur. Come and join me in this adventure as we make the ultimate tool for Solo RPGs and GMs together.</p><p>Latest Update:</p><p>I will start adding the month and day of the upload to each file I upload from now on. And the last upload fixes a nasty bug that occurred when you typed certain characters (\u00b4 \u2019 \u2018 \u2014 \u2026) as text in the description and other text field of the game. Its fixed now and let me now if you encounter any other character that causes problems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T06:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9ac7cbc14998d1ac539a6fe30943e924.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Augur"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
