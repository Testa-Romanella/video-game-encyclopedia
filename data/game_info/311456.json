I have written my own X11 client code, which means the game doesn't use Xlib, and because of this I could statically link MUSL into the executable. The result is that there's only one small executable and the game data. But it is not possible to use hardware acceleration this way, so I also wrote a software renderer.</p>\n<p>Because of this, there's only a Linux executable.</p>\n<p>ALSO APOLOGIES.
