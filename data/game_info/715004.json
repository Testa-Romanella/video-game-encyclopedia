Unfortunately, humans aren't the only ones after it...<br/></em><br/>This is our first game we've ever made. Our goal was to upload a functional game on Christmas, starting December 3rd, and we did it! Chickenator hasn't reached our final desired outcome for the game though, so we'll work on updating the game to make it more interesting and fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:40:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c00aeb76d1c1c9455e4312670e2746e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["jvnglpvnk"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
