It might be tricky, there's plenty of competition. Perhaps you have better odds now that you've found a gun?<br/></p>\n<p>Take on the other animals of the park, and make your way through a random assortment of levels! Find and buy\u00a0items along the way... and shoot dangerous\u00a0frogs! Reach level 10 and prove that you're the worst goose around!</p>\n<p>A game inspired by Risk of Rain,\u00a0made in about 20 days as part of a school project. Made in Unity with little to no prior knowledge of the engine. As the school project ends with this release, we'll see if I continue work here afterwards. Feedback is much appreciated!</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Curious about the game's development? I've got a public Trello board that I used throughout the project, along with a day-by-day progress log.
