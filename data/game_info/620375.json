Half man, and half feral dog merged together by a scientist and stored away in the depths of their lab. You don't want to stay however, you want to get out. By any means necessary.</p>\n<p>Grafted is a game-jam game developed for the 2021 GMTK Jam in 48 hours, with the theme Joined Together. The game is primarily a stealth game, with sneaking and strategic dashes making up the main game-play. Dodge and attack you enemies at the right time to succeed</p>\n<p>This is the game-jam version of the game, meaning there are some elements I would like to polish. The story is fairly non-existent and whilst I would have liked some atmospheric music, the lack of soundtrack has it's own tense charm. Please enjoy my game!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>Code, Art and Sound Effects done primarily by me, in Gamemaker Studio, MagicaVoxel and BFXR Respectively.<br/>Guard design and Voxel model modified off of Max Parata's design, link can be downloaded here: https://maxparata.itch.io/voxel-dystopian-characters<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:37:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef95b12b4dbff8c86036b3bdb4c38e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JudeHDesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
