It was a challenge I want\u00a0to accomplish before I lost the free time I had before. However, my perfectionist still got the better of me so\u00a0the story is like 5%. Writing is not my strongest suit, (it's so bad,\u00a0I can't even bring myself to read it after finishing the demo). I do remember feeling good about the visual hopefully its\u00a0a balance\u00a0trade off TT.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As I was unable to complete the game as I intended, internal turmoil was all I felt <em>finishing</em>\u00a0the game.

However, I changed over the years and def feel more fond of the progress;\u00a0I don't think anyone will actually play it, however, you may enjoy knowing the behind the scene thoughts (at least ive always like to read them). I will pick this development up in Q3 of this year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>See you then :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T10:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/525d2e31f2cceb32a9b78c2e6bfac6e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["tea..."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
