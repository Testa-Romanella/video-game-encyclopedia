{"id": 22597, "slug": "darksiders-iii", "name": "Darksiders III", "name_original": "Darksiders III", "description": "<p>Darksiders III is the third installment in its series of dark fantasy action games. Plotwise, it is the series&#39; spin-off rather than the sequel.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the world after the literal Biblical Apocalypse that involved the Four Horsemen and a battle between angels and demons. The story of Darksiders III unfolds at the background of the events of two original games. Darksiders III follows Fury, a Horsewoman of the Apocalypse and the sister to the original protagonist, War the Horseman. She goes on a quest given to her by the Charred Council, an institution that is meant to keep the balance between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Fury&#39;s mission is to find and annihilate the infamous Seven Deadly Sins. The mighty Lord of the Hollows agrees to help her, although he&#39;s obviously pursuing his own goals. He gives Fury the power of the flame.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Fury from the third person view in an open world. She can use a variety of weapons, including a whip, a sword, and a dagger, as well as her magical abilities. She can also shape-shift into several forms based on elements, such as the flame. Fury also has to solve puzzles and jump platforms. The game reintroduces some of the enemies from the previous parts and introduces new monsters. The enemies in Darksiders III are less numerous but stronger and tougher, taking more effort to beat them.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T17:13:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cb7/cb770f3f9871e1130f40812b05e401b2.jpg", "website": "http://www.darksiders.com", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 318, "owned": 2583, "beaten": 308, "toplay": 221, "dropped": 226, "playing": 36}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 231, "ratings_count": 542, "suggestions_count": 391, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 552, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["THQ Nordic", "Gunfire Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
