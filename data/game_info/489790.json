Going along with the theme of \"The Great Machine\" I thought it would be fitting to submit a project that embodies this theme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tofu Fighter is a first person shooter project I made for fun in my college days. This game is a giant mish mash of code from many different projects, even different developers. I slapped them all together to make something fun and learn along the way. The code is by no means nice code. In fact, I would advise you not take any notes from the design because it was never intended to be a release quality project. (Only for learning) However, given its nature, I feel it fits well with the theme of the great machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is a result of many other working 'machines' that served their purpose and were used and parts taken. Those parts were not discarded though. They have come together to create a new whole. They may be unsightly to look at, but somehow they all seem to work together as a \"great machine\" for learning and\u00a0producing a fun game that can be played amongst friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So please, play the game, sift through the code and see how the different parts work as I once did. Take it apart and make something your own and further the great machine.\u00a0</p><p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>\"A, W, S, D\" - movement</p><p>\"Left mouse click\" - shoot</p><p>\"~\" - chat</p><p>\"esc\" - exit game controls<br/></p><p>Chat commands:\u00a0</p><p>\"/name <your name=\"\">\" - changes player name in the chat</your></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a4741af0f0a62a83b3863fa8f2353386.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jogasoftware07"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
