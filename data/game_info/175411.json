Challenge your friends and dodge incoming balls to be the last one alive to claim victory!</p><p>Developers Statement:</p><p>True Reflex is a game I created entirely on my own (except for the music) over a span of about seven weeks. After playing games such as TowerFall Ascension, Super Hexagon, Lethal League, and many more, I wanted a create a game that captured the experiences I had in those games. If you do end up downloading this game, I hope you and your friends have similar experiences with True Reflex as the ones I had while creating this game.</p><p>- JKUO</p><p>Music:</p><p>\"Voice Over Under\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>\"Ouroboros\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b6cc2a95d41dd2f7ce91657480fb9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JKUO"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
