Essentially, I saw the classic Soko-Ban in glorious CGA graphics, and thought that I could do better than that. Therefore, the game contains four differently-colored block types, one-way arrows, wrapping screens, some other new puzzle elements, and many tricky levels.</p><p>Its initial release on the BBS scene went mostly unnoticed, but a decade later it received a warm reception among niche fans on the internet. It features old-school VGA graphics, dozens of mindbending puzzles, and an undo button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22aa1710fb116bc36d81d30cd4fceb9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Shard"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
