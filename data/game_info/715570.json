Enemies arrive constantly, and you must push or throw them into the water or each other. Move around by spelling words using the letters on the ice. Use your vocabulary to chart the best path across the ice, and survive as long as you can!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Icewords has five unique enemies, each bringing its own quirks and dangers. Attacking enemies earns you letters that you can place on the board, and spelling longer words multiplies the points you earn. As you defeat enemies, you charge up a devastating blizzard that you can unleash when all seems hopeless.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T02:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236595610fdebbec4a2438d5c118b6bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["First Heuristic Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["First Heuristic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
