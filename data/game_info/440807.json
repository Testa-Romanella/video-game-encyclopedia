I am proud of the fact that I set a nice fun-size goal for my first project--make a rudimentary point-and-click adventure game inspired heavily by Mateusz Skutnik's 10 Gnomes games--and I figured out how to do it all by my lonesome in a couple of afternoons.\u00a0 Mostly, I'm proud that I didn't give in to scope creep the way I might have with uh, certain other projects like Ghost in the Matinee</p>\n<p>All that said: this game is hot garbage. I\u00a0know. I own that. But I\u00a0had a lot of fun making it, and I learned things that will help me make whatever GMS2 project I do next be maybe a little less of a pile of hot garbage.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<p>- A piece of my original music never before heard unless you happened to be paying real close attention to the Minecraft streams I used to do years and years ago</p>\n<p>- Environment slapped together in a piece of free home design software (Sweet Home 3D)</p>\n<p>- lol toilet paper\u00a0</p>\n<p>CREDITS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>BGM and environment art are mine, SFX from freesfx.co.uk, various toilet paper images from Pixabay.
