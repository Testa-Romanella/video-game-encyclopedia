You're the sole human employee of a new cafe, and you must work among ghosts, vampires and zombies!</p>\n<p>This is a demo version! The Undead Cafe is a dating sim. You, Taylor, are a human, who's gotten a job at the Undead Cafe. There are nine total romance routes. Three vampires, three ghosts, and three zombies. There is one female for each, one male, and one nonbinary person. Taylor's gender identity (male, female or nonbinary) is decided by you.</p>\n<p>There is no art in this demo. Depending on whether I can get an artist, there may not be any art in the full version, either.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I have a Patreon now, so if you liked the story but didn't like the lack of art, pledge here! Please and thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd1/cd1a8e756db865f3efce42be3ebee726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["personoffewtalents"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
