You only need to edit the action and special effects to show in advance, and then preview it. It will show itself at the rhythm you specify.</p>\n<p>Please wear headphones when playing. The game has built-in video tutorials, which are not only tutorials to teach players how to play the game, but also a small story, full of suspense, laughter and pain.</p>\n<p>There are two points I want to explain in the video tutorials,</p>\n<p>The first one is: during the videos recording days, my wife and I had a big quarrel. I was not in a good mood at that time, but now we have made up.</p>\n<p>The second is: the game&#39;s original price is $5 (June-10-2020---July-10-2020) . I plan to lower the price. So In the future the dollar zone price will not be 5 dollars.</p>\n<p>So the reality may be inconsistent with some contents in the videos, but I don&#39;t want to change it after it has been recorded. And I have no plan to update this game either.</p>\n<p>If the game is not hot, then everything will be good. If the game becomes hot, there will be a lot of troubles. It is better to say something first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-01T00:57:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a1c61758512382504cc1e42885b534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
