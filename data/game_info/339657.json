The theme was a \u2018Heatwave\u2019.</p>\n<p>If you like this game let us know, comment, rate and spread the word so we can expand the concept.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If built up we would like to try upping the burning scale, go from garden fire to burning down cars and streets! With busy robots fighting to stop you from spreading and a arcade scoring system! You know fun stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Flames will be attracted to the red cursor when it\u2019s nearby, use this to spread fire to the end of the level by burning objects in your way!</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Sometimes you need to move objects to go forward. When there is fire near the red cursor it will be able to push nearby objects - move the mouse quickly in the direction you want it to go.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>[tip: make sure the depth of the cursor lines up with the object you want to push.]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Holding the right mouse button makes the red cursor follow the blue cursor.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Move the mouse to move the blue cursor.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Use the scroll wheel, or L Ctrl / L shift, to change the cursor's depth from the camera.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Holding the space bar will let you enter camera mode.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Rotate the camera by moving the mouse.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Zoom the camera in and out using the scroll wheel or L Ctrl / L shift.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>To move the camera through the scene, use wasd or the arrow buttons.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The time spent was around 36 Hours over 10 days.
