{"id": 73947, "slug": "bowman-2-archer-game", "name": "Bowman 2 - Archer Game", "name_original": "Bowman 2 - Archer Game", "description": "<p>Bowman is a highly addictive classical game. Even if you&#39;ve never heard of it before, play it just once and you&#39;ll be hooked.<br />\nThe object of the game is to shoot arrows at your opponent and kill them before they kill you. It&#39;s a battle against your opponent to see who can accurately judge the angle and strength of the shot to make the arrow land on your opponents body.<br />\nA head shot inflicts the most damage while a shot in the chest takes second place. Everywhere else on the opponents body inflicts less damage.<br />\nTo shoot your bow, simply drag your finger across the screen and you&#39;ll be presented with a trajectory plus angle and strength (power) information. Release your finger to release the bow.<br />\nYou can play Bowman against an iOS device or against a friend.<br />\nTo make it even more entertaining, we have also included a bird shooting game. You&#39;ll have to shoot as many birds as you can within 1 minute and then let your friend try the same. Hopefully, you will have shot more birds than your friend.<br />\nIt has many options like windy mode, disabled angle and wall block mode which you can turn on or off depending on how challenging you want it to be.<br />\nThousands and thousands of people play Bowman online every day and now you can enjoy a better version of it on the iOS devices. It really is highly addictive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-08T09:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e3/4e33a88beef50ef26e17bf10e31c8214.jpg", "website": "http://dappsdapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Metin Yucel"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Metin Yucel"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
