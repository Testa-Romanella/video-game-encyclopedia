Darkness descended over the human world, and various creatures began to ravage the royal lands. You have to stop the evil aggressor, build buildings on the path of the enemy troops. The main thing is to build wisely. Each tower has its own special feature. Some shoot fast but do little damage, some slow down enemies, some shoot far but at low rate. Plan your defense!
