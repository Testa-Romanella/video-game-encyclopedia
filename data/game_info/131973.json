You must get through tricky obstacles and multiple enemies to get back to your brother. Can you make it?</p>\n<p>I failed to explain the game clearly enough in the instructions, so here's a complete list of controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to Jump</p>\n<p>Shift to Run</p>\n<p>Holding R makes a wind that pushes you further, but at the same time you have to make counter wind to stop if it gets to powerful. So use it wisely!</p>\n<p>This is my first game maker game, by the way. I have never touched game maker before, and have recently bought it from a bundle for 15 dollars. This game will get a continuation if people like it, in color and all that, with everything improved!</p>\n<p>If things seem off, sorry, I'm doing my last year of highschool and it was really hard for me to finish developing the game in time. I hope you enjoy anyways :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5c54cf8d5aa68eb9b2a856bedfd7183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Octopus58"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
