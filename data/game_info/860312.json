Every 30 seconds, a new enemy will be put into the spawn pool. Can you survive for 9 minutes of an onslaught of varying enemy types?</p>\n<p>Fight 18 enemies that spawn naturally in normal mode + a few extras!</p>\n<p><strong>FOUR MODES TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Normal - The main mode, play this one first. It's straight to the point</p>\n<p>X-treme - Everything is kicked to the next level, the secret characters start spawning in naturally, and many enemies are buffed. You shouldn't play this mode if you're not good...</p>\n<p>Bone Zone - Skullies only, which means your opponents are decided by RNG, good luck</p>\n<p>Reverse - Fight the foes in the reverse order of normal, which means you'll have to deal with the late game much earlier!</p>\n\n\n<p>The other 4 games? Eh, you don't need to care about them. The first 3 games were scratch games, and the 4th was less polished than this one.</p>\n<p>Everything made by me\u00a0<strong>EXCEPT </strong>sfx and music!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T15:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb5/bb5f567c60b57c392a44e3bbc7f061f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fushichanx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
