{"id": 17010, "slug": "kentucky-route-zero", "name": "Kentucky Route Zero", "name_original": "Kentucky Route Zero", "description": "<p>At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it&#39;s easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.</p>\n<p>KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.</p>\n<p>Originally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the &quot;interludes,&quot; which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-16T10:52:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/177/1775aacedb915b0e0880476530dc87b4.jpg", "website": "http://kentuckyroutezero.com", "rating": 3.98, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 249, "owned": 1483, "beaten": 183, "toplay": 333, "dropped": 126, "playing": 65}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 302, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 312, "platforms": ["iOS", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Netflix", "Cardboard Computer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Annapurna Interactive", "Netflix", "Cardboard Computer"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
