That's right, this HTML game is exactly that. Using one of the best game engines out there, I was able to edit the sprites and make them famous MLG characters! Make sure to not lose any health, for the boss's attacks are fatal! Avoid the illuminatis, who seek to end you via kamikaze attacks! Look out for Sonic, who's faster-than-light speed can make fatal, unexpected blows! And beware Pepe, who may look cute, but shoots deadly bullets if he sees you! Play it now for FREE!</p>\n<p>Controls: Hold your cursor to blast bullets and drag it up and down to make the ship go up and down. Drag the cursor forward or backward for the ship to move ahead or back.\u00a0</p><p>Mobile: Hold your finger on the screen to fire, drag finger to move the ship. Same as desktop controls, but with a finger instead of a cursor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T02:48:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b23043507a076b7cddce3ab99e21f122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beingmikhail"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
