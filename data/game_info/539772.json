(Prototype)", "description": "<p>A 3D local multiplayer prototype about whacking balls for points, made in Godot. I started this project on December 1st and first published this repo December 15th.</p>\n<p>This is the largest coding project I've ever taken on, and I've already restarted the project twice. I consider my custom classes and statemachines to be okay, but the scoring code, the UI code, and the reliance on a Singleton need to be broken down and simplified.</p>\n<p>I've had too many unplanned ideas during the creation of this prototype and I did not hesitate to introduce new, unfinished gamemodes that are still lingering in the code right now. Hopefully I can take some time to refactor this project (in a clean folder, restarting the project a third time) so it's even more streamlined and easier to work with.</p>\n<p>My inspiration for this game was initially Potion Wolf: https://bitzawolf.itch.io/potion-wolf , an arcade singleplayer game about combining potions under a time limit. I wanted to create a FPS multiplayer splitscreen version of it after seeing some Goldeneye splitscreen multiplayer footage. After a failed attempt to make a potion-combining game, what I ended up with was instead a game about whacking balls in first person to score points. I am looking to cartoony sportsy games as my next set of inspirations.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you even try this game! I'd love to know that my prototypes are being seen if anything.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:33:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/3075539fce15d3e43b04c7df709d4fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["deertears"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
