Instead of finding.... you're hiding and instead of a pussy there's now a pickle.<br/><br/>Starting with 7 boxes in the first round,\u00a0 you will try to survive the thrilling excitement of selecting a numbered box where you will\u00a0place your pickle inside. *sarcasm*<br/><br/>In each round, the\u00a0C64 attempts the guess which\u00a0box the pickle is in by random.\u00a0If the computer fails, a box is removed and play will continue culminating in a final round where you face off with the C64 where you\u00a0have a 50:50 shot of winning!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you were just as a good as finding a pussy, then you should be just as\u00a0good at hiding\u00a0a pickle too. Download and play the game to find out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T06:47:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d14/d140347af72531875d519deb8503303f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cout Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
