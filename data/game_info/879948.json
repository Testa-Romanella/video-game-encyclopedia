This time I was working fully solo and I decided for very minimalistic style.</p>\n<p>Game description:</p>\n<p>NUMERIC DUNGEON is roguelike-puzzle game. Game is turn based, where in each turn player avatar fight with enemy in dungeon. Combat of the game is fully auto-battler, but before each round player have possibility to swap with enemy selected statistic. Player and enemy are described with 6 stats:</p>\n<p>MaxHealth - amount of Player have health on start of next battle</p>\n<p>Initiative - its define queue of move and attack in auto-battler (more is earlier)</p>\n<p>Damage - how much do you attack to enemy</p>\n<p>Range - minimal distance in axis to reach enemy with attack</p>\n<p>Defence - reduction of damage from enemy</p>\n<p>Movement - how much do you move in single round</p>\n<p>In each round you have possibility to swap values of single statistic. But remember that enemy will do the same. This what will enemy do is showed on top of screen. Beside of swap, you have also possibility to lock selected stat from swap. It will gwarantte, that enemy can't swap this value. But you coudn't be sure if it even try.</p>\n<p>In version for game jam I prepared 4 levels.</p>\n<p>If you like it, leave information, maybe be I will extend this idea in the future :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T06:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b8575d714ea3577f309e08ed29d98e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["&Jay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
