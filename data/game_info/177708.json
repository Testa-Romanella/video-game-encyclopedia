Made with unreal engine 4.</p><p><strong>Game info:</strong></p><p>You play an unnamed protagonist attempting to outrun an unnamed villain. Our unconventional weapon is the power to sneeze and slow down your enemy.</p><p> The dungeon is procedurally generated each game. The object is to survive for as long as possible. You can do co-op (very untested) with up to 4 players on the same screen (gamepads required)</p><p>This very unpolished. The menus don't work properly. Once you get into the game its kinda playable. Maybe in the future we'll have a go a cleaning it up.<br/></p><p><strong>Controls: </strong></p><p>Normal fps and Gamepad controls. Left click to sneeze.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Main Programmer/Designer: Ajani Bilby</p><p>Unreal Noob /Sound editor/Made that one texture you see everywhere: MolarAmbiguity</p><p>Music: TheMysteriousOrb</p><p>This is our first game, like ever.
