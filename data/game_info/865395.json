If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you for your support, enjoy the game!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>LORE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The year is E976, a world  ruled under one banner. The banner of the fiery lion. Symbol of power,  wisdom, and strength. You are a mere vagrant searching for better  opportunities in life. Most of your life you lived as a myrmidon, a  mercenary with no loyalty or allegiance to anyone, or anything other  than gold. But as you grow older you find yourself longing for more.  Your ambitions led you to Homestead, the forgotten fortress. There you  initiate your new quest. To challenge the world\u2019s champions, one by one,  and achieve your ultimate goal, knighthood and all its spoils. Your  ambitions will either make or brake you. You\u2019re ready to die trying.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>WORLD</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mundus, or world, is the realm  where you find yourself in. An array of 21 provinces set in the  middle-ages, ruled by one monarch. Each with its own stronghold,  fortresses built ages ago. The world finds itself mostly in peace, and  knighthood is now merely a status, but still. Today, it\u2019s a well paid  job. Long gone are the days of castle sieges and bloody battlefields.  Mankind is slowly evolving, and now it finds itself thriving in  diplomacy. Duels have become a common sport in the realm, alongside  jousting. Though they don\u2019t come without its ails. Many citizens perish  while engaging in such sports. They are not for the faint of heart, or  mind.         </p>\n<p><strong>MECHANICS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you enter the world  you\u2019ll be taken to the Hero Menu. This is where you can utilize  attribute points gained from leveling into specific attributes like  Strength, Endurance, and Charisma.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Increases attack power efficiently dealing more damage.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Increases your resistance to physical attacks and increases your health.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Charisma:</strong> Governs how much others like you, increases payouts, and morale in a duel.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Points:</strong> Used to increase core attributes. Once used, an attribute point is no more.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Health Points:</strong> Your health represents life. Once your health is depleted to zero, it\u2019s game over.     </p>\n<p><strong>Experience Points:</strong> Governs how far you\u2019re from leveling and earning spendable attribute points.     </p>\n<p><strong>Ranks:</strong> These work as status quo, vanity and ego boosters. As you level up you\u2019ll acquire higher decorative ranks.\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Gold:</strong> This is the world\u2019s currency. You\u2019ll need gold for services. You can also earn some in exchange for labor and winning duels.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>SERVICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Performing certain tasks is  crucial to help ends meet. Despite the world being in peace, there\u2019s  turmoil in economics, and gold is slowly losing its value. This equals  to high prices on everyday needs. It\u2019s important to manage your gold  wisely. Available jobs aren\u2019t infinite, meaning one must take caution  not to overspend needlessly.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Your local blacksmith may  offer services like steel tempering. This technique can increase your  blade\u2019s sharpness, causing it to deal more damage. However, the amount  of times a smith can temper a weapon is significantly limited. Once your  sword reaches maximum improvement you won\u2019t be able to enhance it any  further.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>ITEMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The most common item you\u2019ll  come across are Elixirs. These are life saving concoctions that can  replenish health and keep you from dying. Another item that you may find  are scrolls of wisdom, which provide knowledge, instantly minimizing  required experience to level up. Some of these items are available at  local shops, others can be found by chatting with locals, trading, etc.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>CHAMPIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each Stronghold is guarded by a  seasoned champion. These individuals were awarded their title by the  King, upon proving themselves worthy of it. In order to claim worthiness  you must visit each stronghold and defeat its champion. Only by  acquiring 20 individual seals is that when you can be deemed worthy of  entering Drakeheart Castle, the house of the 21st seal.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>DUELS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Combat can be said to be the  heart of Knights\u2019 Conquest, aside from its many features. Duels take a  different turn than most traditional role playing games. Instead of  doing the fight yourself, you must prepare or \u201cManage\u201d your hero for  combat. Entering combat ill equipped will likely result in poor  outcomes. The game uses a complex algorithm to take into account many  factors in order to simulate realistic combat outcomes. Each duel will  last for one minute. Once the duel starts you\u2019re unable to intervene  until the battle is called. Knights\u2019 Conquest isn\u2019t about killing your  opponent but more so of experiencing exciting, and at times, tense  death-defying matches with AI scalable opponents as you advance in your  quest. Though, be advised, in rare occasions one combatant may perish. <br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME UPDATE #1</strong></p>\n<p>Knights' Conquest pre-release patch 1.1.0 is already included</p>\n<ul><li>Minor UI improvements</li><li>Combat algorithm enhancements</li><li>Small rank to level tuning</li><li>New yield command</li><li>Fixed a game breaking bug</li><li>Source code optimization</li><li>DLC compatibility enabled</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FREE DLC\u00a0COMING\u00a0IN\u00a02023!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T08:40:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb2217833a668a3ef792f4effe88eb22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Felix, J."], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
