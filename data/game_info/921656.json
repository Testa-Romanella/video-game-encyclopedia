The robots, who narrowly escaped incineration, must work together by separating and connecting to navigate through a series of challenging levels filled with obstacles, traps and enemies.</p>\n<p>Players can control the robot either using a single keyboard (WASD and Arrow Buttons) or using the on-screen touch controls or both. The game can be played alone, but as the game title suggests, it is better played together!</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Liluo.io Link:\u00a0https://liluo.io/instant-builds/d693d680-1bbc-4920-a462-4649d1f1f785\u00a0//\u00a0https://liluo.io/unixx/better-together</p><p>GitHub Link:\u00a0https://github.com/chuahxinyu/better-together-game</p>\n<p><strong>Asset Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>(Player Sprite\u00a0) Bub by\u00a0GrafxKid</li><li>(Enemy Sprite) Drone Zapper from Sci-fi Character Pack 6 by\u00a0Peunsbmic</li><li>(Boss Enemy Sprite) Shielder Droid from\u00a0Sci-fi Character Pack 5\u00a0by\u00a0Peunsbmic</li><li>(Level 1 Assets)\u00a0Industrial platformer asset pack by\u00a0just-a-cookie.itch.io</li><li>(Level 2 Background) Pixel Art Backdrops\u00a0by\u00a0the14collective</li><li>(Level 2 Foreground ) City Tileset by\u00a0Peunsbmic</li><li>(Level 3 Assets) 2D Platformer Tileset - Laboratory by ExceptRea</li><li>(Music) \u00a0From Public Domain </li><li>(UI Buttons) Pixel Buttons Set by\u00a0egordorichev</li></ul>\n<p><em>Made by Aussar and unixc</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T00:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/7437493da3a4304bd282533b39bf571f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aussar", "unixc"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
