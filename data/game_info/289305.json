The theme was What Home Means To You. I was lucky to get two talented teammates to help make this game a reality: Muhammad Asyraf bin Ibrahim, our programmer, and Muhammad Fitri bin Amalludin, our artist! The original game we had built and submitted for GGJ2019 can be downloaded here.<br/></p><p>Since I had free time during the jam, I decided to work on my own prototype as well. In the event that I wanted to make changes and tweaks after the jam was over, I could do it on my own without having to inconvenience Asyraf and Fitri. The prototype is what you can see playing right now on the browser. it's also mobile friendly!</p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/></p><p>v1.0<br/>- Game released</p><p>=======</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44cf2b6117be69663b558ca3fc02e130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JunoStriker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
