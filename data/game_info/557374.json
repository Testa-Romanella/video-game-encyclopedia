To do so you will need to harvest commodities (rocks and wood)\u00a0to craft tracks.</p>\n<p>You will need an Axe to harvest wood and a Pickaxe to harvest rocks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Approach a tool (axe or pickaxe) and press <strong>SPACE</strong> to pick it up when it's highlighted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stay close to a tree or a rock to harvest it.</p>\n<p>When commodity is harvested you can pick it up just like a tool. But you will need to drop a tool first. In order to do it just press SPACE in any empty space on the map.</p>\n<p>Put a harvested rock on a piece of harvested wood (or wise versa) to craft a pile of railroad tracks. Each pile contains 3 pieces of tracks.</p>\n<p>Pick up a pile of track and put a piece from it in front of the track to continue it.</p>\n<p>Also you will get a pre-crafted pile of tracks in the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>Try to prevent the train from crushing as long as possible.</p>\r\nInspiration\r\n<p>This game is a loose demake of a great game UnRailed! by Indoor Astronaut</p>\r\nMade with:\r\n<p>Haxe + Heaps</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c109e20638c7291458b914ed1f19cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael Miriti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
