Play with your friends from the social networks or with random rivals in the network!<br/><br/>The year is 1923.  You are Vasily Chapayev, leader of the Russian Red Army and hero to the people.  Since the beginning of your country\u2019s Civil War in 1917, you\u2019ve lead your soldiers to victory many times.  Many times, you fought and won but not today. <br/>Right now, you are wounded and fleeing capture from your enemies.  They\u2019re closing in fast, you\u2019re surrounded and there\u2019s no place to go but the river.  Determined to make it to freedom, you dive in, swimming for your very life.  As you get close to the other side, you can see the shore and freedom.  Just a few more feet to go and you will have made your escape.  Just a few more feet, a few more minutes, that\u2019s all that\u2019s standing between you and life because not getting there is certain death.  As you climb out of the water to head for the trees, an enemy bullet finds you.  You take in the forest that would have saved your life as you fall to the ground.  The life drains from your body mere inches away from cover.<br/>This story of Vasily Chapayev is true.  He was a legendary hero of the Russian Civil War (1917 \u2013 1923).  A valiant horseman and talented military leader, Chapayev won many victories until enemy White Army soldiers wounded and captured him.  Chapayev was shot while trying to swim across a river to freedom.  He almost made it before the bullet ended his life.<br/>The legend of Chapayev lives on in the iChapaev app.  Chapayev is the most popular board game in The Soviet Union.  Dynamic and exciting, it\u2019s like a dashing cavalry attack and gambling game.<br/><br/>Rules of the game are diabolically simple.  Shoot enemy checkers from the board while ensuring that as many of yours stay on as possible.  If yours is the last man standing, you win.  You\u2019ll need a keen eye and strong hand to be the victor in this app but more than that, you need clever strategy.<br/>Each iChapaev player gets 8 checkers to start, which are placed on opposite ends of the game board.  Go ahead and use your finger to pull back your checker, then let go to shoot toward your opponent\u2019s game piece.  Little arrows indicate the direction and stroke power of your shot.  The player with at least one checker left on the board wins the battle. <br/>The war is not over with the first battle, though.  If your opponent has found an excellent strategy, you may find it challenging to overthrow him in the second game.  All is fair in love and war and that includes iChapaev.  You never know who is going to win.<br/>If you want to give yourself a game playing advantage, fine tune your skills and hone your moves by playing against the app initially.  After you\u2019ve developed your game playing skills, invite a partner to join you in a war game.  If you\u2019ve practiced and perfected your game, you\u2019re bound to win more than you lose.<br/><br/>Just to keep things interesting, there are three levels of complexity:<br/>* Easy level \u2014 the arrow showing the direction and the force of strike has depicted<br/>* Medium level \u2014 just the arrow showing the direction of strike has depicted<br/>* High level \u2014 the arrow hasn\u2019t been depicted at all<br/><br/>So, who will you be, The White Army with at least one checker left on the board, or the poor hero Chapayev?  There\u2019s only one way to find out.  Better grab the iChapaev app now so you can start practicing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a9252b04583b3ee9e5ddd7ae65635107.jpg", "website": "http://maxnick.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MaxNick"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Nikolay Verevkin"], "esrb_rating": null}
