This gamejam was about creating games that overlap in a shared universe. This game is an action shooter that features the characters I designed for the universe as well as subtley referencing some of the other characters created for the universe.</p>\n<p>There was so much I wanted to do for this but as usual I overscoped by several thousand miles. I had originally planned 3 areas plus a boss fight with Dr Raven and his Thralls at the end. One of the areas would have been the animals settlement and another would have been the new underground lab being built by Raven.</p>\n<p>I also had planned for you to be able to have animal mutant thralls and even non obvious thralls like tree monsters that had grown in Recondite soil. <br/></p>\n<p>For time I had to cut this right back and build all I could into the main area. I didn't even get to put Dr Raven in. Who knows maybe I'll have a look a adding this stuff later.<br/></p>\n<p>Contains universe references to:</p>\n<ul><li>Recondite, the mysterious metal, its abilities and effects.</li><li>CR (Crossover Research), the reclaimation teams, labs and secret projects.</li><li>Hazmat suit wearing humans</li><li>Lab animals/mutants, their settlement and king.</li></ul>\n<p>Design, Logic, Main Characters, Story designed by Circumpunk-KKB</p>\n<p>Subtlely references other characters created for the Crossover Universe<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unity Engine:</p>\n<p>Other Resources:</p>\n<p>Available from Unity Asset Store:</p>\n<ul><li>Playmaker by Hutong Games\r\n</li><li>2D free Crystal Set by Diluck\r\n</li><li>40+ Simple Icons by Shuvadanil\r\n</li><li>Outdoor Ground Texture by A dogs life software\r\n</li><li>Advanced People Pack 2 by Alex Lenk\r\n</li><li>Beautiful Progress Bar Free by CYKO\r\n</li><li>Black and White Achievements Pack by Duct Games\r\n</li><li>Frank RPG Mage by Frank Climax\r\n</li><li>Cartoon FX Remaster by Jean Moreno\r\n</li><li>Mesh Effects by Kripto289\r\n</li><li>Mr Mo Character by Omabuarts Studio\r\n</li><li>Low poly ultimate pack by Polyperfect\r\n</li><li>Sherbbs Particle Collection by Sherbb\r\n</li><li>Simple Apocalypse by Synty Studios\r\n</li><li>TopDownEngine by More Mountains\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<ul><li>Free Casual Game Sound FX by Dusty Room</li><li>Dark Fantasy Pack 2 Music by Griffin Silbey</li><li>Dynamic Horror Ambience by CAFOFO</li><li>Modern Soundtrack Music Trap Style by Sound4Gaming</li><li>Scifi Guns SFX Pack by Mikael Vanninen</li></ul>\n<p>Available from Sketchfab available under Creative Commons Attribution:</p>\n<ul><li>Lowpoly hazmat \u0441haracter by Sololopenko</li></ul>\n<p>As always many thanks for checking it out<strong>.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>All the best.\u00a0 </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately I had noticed much better performance in non-fullscreen mode. </strong><strong>I didn't have time to do another tweak for performance but I will try and see if I can get one in if it is a major problem.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Um and I have noticed the Thralls bug up sometimes and don't appear.
