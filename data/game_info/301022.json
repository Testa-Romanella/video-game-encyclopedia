I didn't have too much time to make it interesting, but I\u00a0made everything from scratch and learned a lot, and I also got some ideas for a larger game (realistically, next 7DRL).</p>\n<p>This game uses the 16-color PICO-8 palette and the lively 4x6 PICO-8 character set, in an attempt to make the equivalent of a\u00a0traditional ASCII roguelike on the PICO-8.
