Use burning barrels to ignite a chain reaction of fire through the forest. Right now the game is just about wanton destruction but I would like to expand the idea make it an educational game about fire prevention and controlled burning.</p>\n<p>Use left click to place a barrel, right click to delete it, and space to set it off. Burn down ten trees to gain back two barrels. Try to burn down as many trees as you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:56:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1adeace20b0dfb6971d2314f2d3dc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanSPeterson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
