{"id": 552794, "slug": "faith-of-mustard-seed", "name": "Faith of Mustard Seed", "name_original": "Faith of Mustard Seed", "description": "<p>\"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\" - Mark 4:31-32</p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0BlackThornProd Game Jam #3 with theme \"Less is More\", this is a game about a mustard plant.</p>\n<p><strong>Story &amp; Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>A mustard seed grew into a mustard plant. However, this mustard plant is being attacked by demonic golems trying to destroy it. With the power of faith, throw those demonic golems into the air; drop it from high places -- hitting other golems with falling golems also work. Faith is also used to grow the mustard plant.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse: Click to pick up golems, release click to release golems. With some velocity you can also throw golems high up into the air. Click is also used to upgrade the mustard plant when you have enough faith.</p>\n<p>A&amp;D or Arrow Keys:\u00a0Move cameras.</p>\n<p><strong>Further remarks:</strong></p>\n<p>With regards to the theme\u00a0\"Less is More\", it seems I only follow the theme in terms of narrative only:\u00a0the game follows the theme by the way of a mustard seed, which can grow into a tree despite being very small when it's still seed. The gameplay itself unfortunately doesn't really follow the theme \"Less is More\" although I tried coming up with gameplays that could fit... but if one wants to interpret the gameplay somehow to fit the theme, it would be that too much picking up golems can be detrimental and so the player needs to maximize every picking move -- namely by making sure golems fall onto other golems.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is indeed based on the parable about mustard seed representing the Kingdom of Heaven\u00a0-- and the gameplay based on another passage about faith as big as mustard seed being able to move mountains (or in the case of this game, demonic golems). This game is theologically inaccurate with regard to the verses, but one can say that the mustard plant in the game represents one's faith and the demonic golems represent sins shaking one's faith. (^_^;</p>\n<p>The gameplay is also heavily inspired by one of the flash games I used to play as a kid: \"Defend Your Castle\". For some reasons I suddenly remembered about that game and then reused said game's concept into the game with some modifications.</p>\n<p>The music was composed in a rush in just 12 hours using FL Studio 20. I must say it's kind of a miracle I could come up with a music in just one day when usually it takes me at least a week -- must be because this music is kind of a Frankenstein (lol); the music took heavy inspirations from Kasen's theme, Koishi's theme, Shinki's theme, and Gengetsu's theme.</p>\n<p>Godot Engine was used to make this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e241b5b9b92d0222942d2a5ce72af13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ran d'Reille"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
