{"id": 890001, "slug": "forest-fire-chuteapps", "name": "Forest Fire (chuteapps)", "name_original": "Forest Fire (chuteapps)", "description": "<p>Forest Fire is a roguelite destruction game with a simple objective: Burn as much as possible. This may or may not include; trees, animals, housing, and those pesky humans. Every pixel is physically simulated and will spread your flame far and wide.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll burn unopposed. Mother nature has sent in a bullet-hell array of rain clouds and other obstacles to put an end to your destruction fest. Your flame must weave through the storm to survive.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a roguelite game so each run is different. However, we still maintain a sense of progression with persistent level up points. This means you get stronger, even if you die 5000 times.\r\n</p>\n<p>The forest is vast and unending, with a myriad of secrets hidden within her. Are you ready to burn?</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The game is still in early development and I'll be releasing updates every week. I greatly appreciate your feedback during this period as I'm sure it will help shape the game!
