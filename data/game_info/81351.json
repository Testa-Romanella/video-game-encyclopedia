With nearly 1,400 words in a massive 120x120 grid, if music be the food of love, play this game!<br/><br/>Use two fingers to scroll around the massive grid, then drag with one finger to highlight a word. Zoom out at any time to see a summary of your progress. <br/><br/>The puzzle is arranged as 16 themed sections, each containing 80-100 words. <br/><br/>To solve the entire thing, you'll meet a pair of star-crossed lovers in Verona, watch Julius Caesar betrayed by his closest friends, question the sanity of King Lear and see jealousy tear Othello apart.  Attend masquerade balls, mix up everyone's identities and enjoy the verbal wit of the Bard of Avon. <br/><br/>Friends, Romans, countrymen, find me some words!  <br/><br/>Earn Game Center achievements along the way and compare your progress to others on the global leaderboard. <br/><br/>Epic Shakespeare Word Search was compiled from user submissions in Word Search Party, also by Lightwood Games. Like our record-besting game Word Search 10K, it has been hand-crafted to form one continuous puzzle with words in every direction. <br/><br/>If you have any questions or comments please send an email to support@lightwoodgames.com.
