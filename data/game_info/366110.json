{"id": 366110, "slug": "first-class-trouble", "name": "First Class Trouble", "name_original": "First Class Trouble", "description": "<p>First Class Trouble is an asymmetrical third person multiplayer co-operative game, about trust and deceit.<br />\nWith First Class Trouble we want to invoke a super strong social experience, filled with trust and deception. Players are working together, but a few players are not who they seem and are actively working against you. With First Class Trouble we want to create situations where you can never fully trust your companions, but you will have to trust someone in order to progress through the game. This means that you constantly have to look over your shoulder, uncover information on players and in the end, you will have to figure out who the Synth players are to win the game. We aim to create a rich playground of possibilities fueled by social interactions with other players. This will result in a new player experience each time you press \u201cfind a game\u201d.<br />\nThe plot<br />\nWe are on board the Alithea, a massive 2 km long space cruise ship, set for Proxima Centauri. Owned by the prominent Scandinavian Infinity Cruises, it is the most prestigious space project ever undertaken; a merger of wealth, power, and business in a newly technological world gone wild. Packed with all the latest tech, Alithea is also equipped with the latest in AI servants - Personoids. There had been some problem with maintaining the Personoids emotional state, but it had been solved before departure. The solutions were simply to reboot all the synths every 24 hours. But something failed \u2013 of course. Someone, or rather something in the system, didn\u2019t reboot. Things spiraled out of control aboard the Alithea. Now it\u2019s passing Jupiter at 1/8 the speed of light, with a robot rebellion. C.A.I.N. has already tried to eliminate all the passengers by turning the oxygen off, and only a couple of travelers with Oxygen Rebreathers are left - trying to escape. Luckily the Personoids, were purposely designed to be weaker than humans - because they are searching the ship for the last remaining humans. Hiding among them. Ready to finally \u2018reset\u2019 them for once.<br />\nFirst Class Trouble varies from other titles with its engaging mix of cooperation and deception, using an in-depth proximity-based voice system, where players can communicate only when close to each other. It is through these close social interactions that intense and fun situations will arise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-27T14:04:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/51044509a3c55f107763f0593a89cb22.jpg", "website": "https://firstclasstrouble.com", "rating": 2.94, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 74, "owned": 781, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 27, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 33, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 33, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "PC"], "developers": ["Invisible Walls ApS"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["TBA"], "esrb_rating": null}
