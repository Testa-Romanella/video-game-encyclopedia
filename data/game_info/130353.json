You control the shield with the SPACE key. You can pause using the P key. You do not need any other keys. There are no levels, it simply runs forever, until you close it. There is a small variety of different blobs to protect the blob in the middle from. The game doesn't come with any music. The colors of your shield can be customized during gameplay, but not by you.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note that i have cheated on the time limits (not on purpose).</p>\n<p>The font i used is OpenDyslexic, which can be found at https://opendyslexic.org/.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/013/013cfe886278a3ac6348775684e3643a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["earth-rabbit"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
