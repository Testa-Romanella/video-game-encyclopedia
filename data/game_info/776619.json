Your task is to fly to the collection point for further shipment to the sector, which you will have to clear.

Minimalistic pixel art, beautiful music and lots of space rocks are waiting for you.\r\n\n<p>In the game you are waiting for:</p>\n<ol><li>Ten bonuses.</li><li>Dangerous enemies.</li><li>\u00a0Lots of asteroids.</li><li>Five beautiful compositions.</li><li>World leaderboard (Windows only)</li></ol>\n\n<p>The future, if it exists at all. Okay, I'm kidding)</p>\n<p>Future:</p>\n<ol><li>More bonuses.</li><li>More enemies.</li><li>If I can, then even bosses are possible.</li><li>We will find a use for the \"Z\" key!</li><li>And, of course, bug fixes, if any.</li></ol>\n\n<p>The Linux version unfortunately does not support world leaderboards and gamepads.
