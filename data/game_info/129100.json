I used GiMP, pygame, and TextMate to make this game.</p>\n<p>You are given a Solitaire-like layout of cards. You can choose to play your cards in any order, but are awarded points when the last three cards in order form a chord. For this game, the following are valid chords: major, minor, augmented, and diminished. This gives you 48 chords to make! Scoring rewards a variety of chords, rather than many of one type.</p>\n<p>This is a rather simple puzzle game, so I don't have many plans for improvements. However, here are some things on my potential TODO list:</p>\n<ul><li>Toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode</li><li>Optimize chord sound generation</li><li>Optimize game launch</li><li>Play back all chords in order at game end, just for kicks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bd49e6aa09d918383383ecc260532d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Aitocir"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
