Now you just have to deal with the adventurers...\u00a0Build up your deck of traps and treasures to take them out. Will you outlive this raiding party? Let's find out!</p>\r\nWhat Is Dungeon Deckers?\r\n<p>Dungeon Deckers is a solo deck-building game. The aim is to get the most victory points before 20 rounds (The party has been exhausted) or until you run out of lives (You have been overrun!).</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 4 phases:</p>\r\nStart of Round\r\n<p>A new adventurer enters your dungeon and you draw a fresh hand of 5 cards. Hover over an adventurer to see their current health and their max health.</p>\r\nAttack Phase\r\n<p>Use trap cards from your hand to wound adventurers. Killing adventurers earns you a lot of victory points! Trap cards can also have other effects to help you.</p>\r\nUpgrade Phase\r\n<p>Play treasure cards in your hand to gain gold. Spend gold to buy better cards from the shop for your deck! Remember, gold only lasts for the current upgrade phase.</p>\r\nEnd of Round\r\n<p>All adventurers advance into your dungeon. If any make it past the final zone, you lose a life! You also gain a Wizard card. This does nothing but clog up your deck (Pesky wizards!)</p>\n<p>You also discard any remaining cards in your hand.</p>\r\nEnd Of The Game\r\n<p>The game ends after 20 rounds or after you lose all your lives. Your final score is your VP's + the cost of all cards in your deck. Try to get the highest score you can!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Coding + Design - Freddie Jones</li><li>Art - James Riley</li><li>SFX - Ancient Game SFX Library by Epic Stock Media</li><li>Music - Title Screen by sawsquarenoise</li><li>Font - Dogica by Roberto Mocci</li></ul>\n<p>Dungeon Deckers was made by the Good Bois\u00a0in 74 hours for the Indie Tales Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4ef158013dffe24c5cec18764175e453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["freddster1018"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
