It was a scary time for Simple Machine, it was 2015 and I was 2 months away from closing\u00a0for good because we couldn't make enough money. <br/></p>\n<p>I made a small prototype of a checkers puzzle game ... that ended not being anything like checkers. It became one of the most simple and challenging games to ever hit touch screens.</p>\n<p>When it released on iOS it was an immediate hit. I had never seen anything like it, in 4 weeks we hit 2 million downloads.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we were back in business (for a while).</p>\n<p>I always wanted to take that simple mechanic to so many new places but it felt like there was never any time (the mobile market is just a wee bit competitive in that way). <br/></p>\n<p>This past year, in December, my company really actually crashed out this time. I laid off all our employees and moved out of our NYC studio (sniff sniff).\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>*dries eyes*<br/></p>\n<p>Eventually I started making games again. That's when a good friend of mine was interested in collaborating to make some games, and since July 2020 we've been chipping away at this.</p>\n<p>Today we finally have our first alpha build and I hope you'll try it and check it out &lt;3</p>\n<p>You can play through the first 6 levels and make it to the end of the alpha.</p>\n<p>We're looking for all kinds of feedback, ideas, bugs, thoughts, or just shouting \"I love this\" works too :)<br/></p>\n<p>You can hop on the Discord and let us know what you think (it's also a pretty awesome community and I hope you'll stick around).</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>kurtiswow and dale<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:39:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318e8e3e14609b0058b51c85002ab1d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["kurtiswow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
