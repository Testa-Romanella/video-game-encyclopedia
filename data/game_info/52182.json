Choose a layer, and then wherever you look, your cloud cursor follows. Press a button, and the nearest pilgrim will leap towards it. Use this simple system to manage multiple pilgrims at the same time, but be careful you don\u2019t send them hurtling into an enemy\u2019s path \u2013 or worse, off the sides of the islands completely!<br/><br/>A second player can help guide you on your adventure by watching on the Social Screen and offering advice. Or they can pick up a second controller and take command of BORB, the Cloud Pig! BORB can shift between layers freely, collecting items and helpfully (or sometimes not so helpfully!) pushing pilgrims around as she goes!<br/><br/>1-2 players<br/>2GB minimum save size<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>PlayStation\u00aeVR Required<br/>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Required<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
