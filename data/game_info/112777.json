In the style of a Gameboy game because I've been playing my Gameboy again lately and I was curious about trying to use such a limited colour palette. </p><p>Shoot down enemy bikes and planes while avoiding their shots and collisions. You need to line yourself up with the enemy in both the side view and top view to be able to hit them (and for them to hit you!).</p><p>w, a, s, d - move in side view</p><p>arrow keys - move in top view</p><p>space - fire</p><p>r - restart</p><p>esc - quit</p><p>It might work with gamepads? Maybe? I'm going to try to make that a definite thing in the future.</p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #6 or 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a457813d01c0a9c736a430d2b09ae8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
