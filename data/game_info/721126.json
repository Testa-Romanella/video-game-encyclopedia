(github.com)</p>\n<p>This was a test submission for a job I\u00a0applied for (I didn't get it :( ). I didn't want this work to go to waste, so I\u00a0decided to upload my work here for everyone to see or use. A\u00a0gamepad is required.</p>\n<p>The inventory involves moving 5 random icons around and rearranging them. You can create or destroy the\u00a0icons at will. The test also required the shoulder buttons\u00a0to change the screen resolution.</p>\n<p>The icons are generated by using scriptable objects and 5 game objects to present the data. For each icon, I\u00a0provided a short animated description, which\u00a0was something extra I\u00a0added for\u00a0the test, among other things.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music is \"Journeys Ahead\" by Andrea Baroni -\u00a0https://cyberleaf.itch.io/a-journey-to-remember</li><li>Icons are from here:\u00a0https://franuka.itch.io/rpg-icon-pack</li><li>\u00a0\"Alagard\" font by Hewett Tsoi -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/hewett-tsoi.d4888\u00a0</li><li>Button prompts are from this pack \u00a0https://retrocademedia.itch.io/buttonprompts4</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T04:29:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b059a7e621dde961c9abff8a7ce3c5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Murray"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
