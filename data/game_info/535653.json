{"id": 535653, "slug": "word-cascade", "name": "Word Cascade", "name_original": "Word Cascade", "description": "Midway between the word search and the *tris games, this game challenges your mastery of the language, your ability to strategize, your reaction time and your attention to detail. In the <strong>Classic</strong> mode, you must race the clock to find words on the grid and prevent the ever falling letters from reaching the top of the screen. Filled rows will let you shift sideways, a real key to staying alive! In contrast, the <strong>Zen</strong> mode gives you an eternally filled grid where your only goal is to find as many words as you want, at your leisure. If you'd rather play with a full grid, yet keep the pressure on, the <strong>Time Attack</strong> mode might be what you're looking for. Finally, the <strong>Escalation</strong> mode will reward your ability at making long words, for queuing small ones will mark the end of the game. Infinite gameplay, no real upper score, simple controls and clear mechanics makes this a fun arcade game without any cheap continues. More to come very, very soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T03:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bc/7bc0de04edfcbd50073764ef8e90dc10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reverse Impact"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reverse Impact"], "esrb_rating": null}
