Each of these unique voices is housed in separate structures placed periodically around the venue. Every room has a different story and person attached to it. In the center you hear my personal community speaking all at once, but when you walk into one of the structures you\u00a0hear\u00a0one interview.\u00a0 The effect is zooming in on one voice among a community of voices.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Stewart\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711b51b094ad6119ca9996752b9e4823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BlackwoodStewart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
