There are no choices to be made, nothing to stress over. Just a story being told.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is free, however, a donation can be made if you so wish. Anything made off of In Bloom will go towards the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing suicide in LGBTQ+ youth.<br/></p>\n<p>Created with the help of several volunteers willing to tell their trans awakening stories, In Bloom\u00a0is a story about the less talked about parts of a trans awakening. So many people know they're trans as kids, but what happens if you don't find out until later on in life? What if you still like things associated with your assigned gender? What if you don't know how you want to identify? All of these subjects are given the spotlight in In Bloom.</p>\n<p>Happy Pride Month &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>Made in Ren'Py</p>\n<p>Script and Coding:\u00a0vhsdreamland\r\n</p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0Ashely Chong</p>\n<p>Past Sadness by Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5024-past-sadness\r\n</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license\r\n</p>\n<p>Sincerely by Kevin MacLeod\r\n</p>\n<p>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5033-sincerely\r\n</p>\n<p>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Sound Effects from Mixkit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2ce249c5c278552ca0244a22e962d61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["vhsdreamland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
