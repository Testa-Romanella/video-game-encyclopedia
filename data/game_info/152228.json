It really makes the game flow a lot better.</p><p>======== <br/>CONTROLS: <br/><br/>X - SHAPE SHIFT WITH \"X\" <br/>MOVE WITH ARROW KEYS <br/>RESTART A LEVEL BY PRESSING THE NUMBER OF IT (1 to 8) ON THE KEYBOARD</p><p>M - Mute / Unmute music </p><p>RED RAY can punch enemies so hard that they turn into cacti, if you time it right. <br/><br/>BLUE RAY can push cacti so that they slide on the ground. <br/><br/>======== <br/><br/>My first Ludum Dare! <br/><br/>After the first day I switched from an action game to more of a puzzle game + redid all the graphics, so it's all very last minute - I would have loved to have been able to make some more levels and mechanics. It still shows the concept successfully, especially level 5 is fun and has all the mechanics coming together pretty well. The game just loops level 5 after you complete it though, it's the last level I managed to get in in time. <br/><br/>The source code is pretty atrocious due to switching the gameplay mid-Jam as well as learning how Unity does certain stuff and hacking around a lot of bugs that I didn't have time to fix in a good way. <br/><br/>You can switch levels by pressing numbers 1-5 on the keyboard. <br/><br/>Made using: <br/><br/>* Unity 5 <br/>* PyxelEdit <br/>* Tiled </p><p>Original Ludum Dare entry:</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=p...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/937d359c34c2b3eca024c9e0d13cea47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["neontropics"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
