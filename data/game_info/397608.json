Get a high score, turn off the scrolling backgrounds, and...erm...okay yeah that's basically all there is to it if I'm being honest. This was mainly just to get used to Unity since I'm fairly new to it. But hey, it does look pretty cool, right? Tried to make it look like it's actually being played off of a CRT screen like in the old days! I think that part went well.</p>\n<p>...oh! And cower in fear at the RANDOMLY GENERATED ASTEROID PATHS! There's no way of knowing how many there'll be and where they'll spawn! It'll really knock your socks off!</p>\n<p>Made as a Year 2 school project with the theme of \"One More Go\".</p>\n<ul><li>Left Arrow - Move left</li><li>Right Arrow - Move right</li><li>[TITLE] Down Arrow - Toggle background scrolling</li><li>[TITLE]\u00a0Space - Toggle background</li><li>[TITLE]\u00a0P - Toggle post-processing</li><li>[TITLE] Delete - Reset data</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139d9223691bc05a6868787e1ec42433.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jak S."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
