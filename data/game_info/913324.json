This winter has been one of the roughest yet, with the temperature constantly going below freezing. Today is supposed to be the worst, with a snowstorm incoming. Marie decides to run down to the grocery store to get supplies for the upcoming storm, but forgets the keys inside her house. Now, you have to find ways to survive the freezing temperature.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Z to interact</p>\n<p>X to sprint</p>\n<p>Space to pause/start</p>\n<p>I actually have a ton of ideas for this game to turn it into an actual survival game post-jam with fishing, hunger, objectives, hunting, campfires,\u00a0multiple player characters, etc.</p>\n<p>How the limitation is used:</p>\n<p>-Your score is used to progress the game. The more score you have, the more the snowstorm picks up and the less beverages appear.</p>\n<p>-Your score can be used to purchase items from shop.</p>\n<p>The shop was rushed in last minute lol (so was this page)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T05:13:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ac/7ac85c20dc12c4d72627ff9e957b19e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HatPass"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
