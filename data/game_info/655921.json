This game marks the first time I have participated in one.</p><p>I'm still a beginner with game dev in general so as a result this game will definitely not be the best. That being said, I\u00a0did learn quite a lot.<br/></p><p>Made in Pygame, a library for the programming language Python.</p><p>Defend your bean from 3 different bombs:\u00a0</p><p>1. Basic - nothing interesting.</p><p>2. Fast - moves faster.</p><p>3 Armored - takes three hits to destroy.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>-Art: Done by me, I'm no artist so it may not look the best.</p><p>-Programming: Done by me.</p><p>-Sound Design: Done by me.</p><p>Lastly, this project is far from where I\u00a0wanted it to be. That being said,\u00a0I hope this little game give you some level of enjoyment. Any feedback would be appreciated, Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:00:10", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["beaninator"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
