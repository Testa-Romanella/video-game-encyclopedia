StellarEchoes:BoxingChampion is one of the sequels, in which players travel to a target planet as a recruit to the Interstellar Authority to complete trials and earn the Medal of Achievement. This time, under the URP rendering pipeline, we reconstructed and upgraded the Qingzhou spacecraft, making the experience smoother and the scene more realistic. The gameplay has also been greatly updated, completely abandoning the EA version of the level map. In particular, the design of the StellarEchoes:BoxingChampion is very unique, and I think people who love fitness should like it very much.<br/>\r\nIn StellarEchoes:BoxingChampion, you can get a magical piece of equipment that has played boxing, and what about boxing gloves that can fly out for strikes! In order to maximize the space for boxing equipment, we have designed a bottom-up pyramid structure in the scene map, with a total of 7 floors, each of which can make you sweat like a fitness. After the 7th floor, there's the boss encounter, and if you can see it, you'll ask if it's the naughty guy from the 4th series!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T05:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a2099c481764fa9a2fc4e57a209928.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LI YIN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LI YIN"], "esrb_rating": null}
