Instead of aiming your attacks, focus on precise movements and positioning\u00a0to avoid enemies and lead them to their deaths.</p>\n<p>Perfect for quick play sessions while in queue for another game, or when you need a few minutes to blow.</p>\n<p>____________________________</p>\n<p>This is my first game and it was\u00a0created with the Godot engine. I'd really appreciate feedback and support of any kind, thank you!</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:\u00a0@austintradr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f29e0f819f335692fa056c08948a3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Austin Rogers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
