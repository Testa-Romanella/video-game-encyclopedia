You start at one of the forts and the other fort is a little further along on the same island. There is an enemy guarding that other fort. <br/></p>\n<p>A fort is neutral if it has a grey healthbar, allied if green and hostile if red. An enemy fort can only be captured after its been destroyed (0 health).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can ask your ally to follow you, or bring an enemy to them. An allied fort will also provide support. You need to be near (about 300m) from an ally/fort to interact. You can also interact with disabled enemy ships.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Current features include:</strong></p>\n<p>- Enemy/Ally ship AI<br/></p>\n<p>- Sailing mechanic with wind direction<br/></p>\n<p>- Configurable cannon firing patterns</p>\n<p>- Repairing mechanic</p>\n<p>- Targeting mechanic, manually set cannon range<br/></p>\n<p>- Capture point mechanic with forts<br/></p>\n<p>- Player interaction with forts and other ships.</p>\n<p>- Give commands to allies</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- Right click mouse to look, scroll to zoom<br/></p>\n<p>- Tab = toggle targeting mode.</p>\n<p>When in targeting mode: W and S to adjust range. Q and E to fire upper and lower deck cannons.</p>\n<p>When OUT of targeting mode: 2xQ to fire all port cannons, 2xE to fire all starboard cannons.</p>\n<p>The other controls are on screen.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Game still very early in development, would love some feedback on this prototype. Thanks!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Notes:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rear sail is not working properly at the moment, i am in the process of redoing sail animations.</p>\n<p>The UI is placeholder.
