The player's mission is to develop a crew and a starship and find the raiders' base and rid the system of them. The game was particularly notable for a musical score that simulated multiple instruments by swapping between them faster than the human ear could differentiate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d13b005545fb5e5884958e26b29b841.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Karl Buiter"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
