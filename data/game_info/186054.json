It contains the intro to the game, the first powerup, and the following area, stopping right before the second boss would appear.</p><p>Some things are notably lacking from this version, such as saving and sound effects. You should be able to complete the game in 15 minutes though, and as far as sound why not put on your favorite concerto or whatever the kids listen to these days.<br/><br/>Controls are:<br/>Up/Down/Left/Right - move<br/>R - restart room<br/>Space - use power<br/>Q/Escape - quit</p><p>To run the game you need Love2d.
