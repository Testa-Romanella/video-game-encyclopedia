Players can see the future and control the flow of time, allowing them to play frame-perfectly. Paths through levels can be easily shared, for boasting or collaboration.<br/><br/>Rktcr contains 37 challenge levels, ranging from easy to impossible; and 31 world levels, algorithmically arranged into 300 worlds of varying complexity. All told, there are more than 1600 paths to discover and optimize.<br/><br/>The Steam release of Rktcr adds Achievements, Trading Cards, and a smattering of graphical polish.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/757f1913e35c23df170681a403c6512f.jpg", "website": "http://rktcr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TCHOW"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TCHOW"], "esrb_rating": null}
