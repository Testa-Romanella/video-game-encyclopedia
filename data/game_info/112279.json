No more golf!<strong>No Pause!</strong>- Want to check your map? Don't take too long, there's monsters about.<strong>Different Modes!</strong>- IronMan mode has no saving - that would be pausing the game now, wouldn't it?<br/>- WedgeMan mode is traditional Roguelike saving - save file gets deleted when you reload.<br/>- PutterMan mode allows saving at any point (one save per seed per level).<strong>Traditional RogueLike features</strong> - Found a potion? Drink it to find out what it is. Read scrolls, wield weapons and armour, zap wands and wear rings. <strong>Play the first 4 Levels</strong> - Defeat puzzles, traps, and a wide range of monsters before taking on the Dragon on level 12 (in the full game). <strong>Multilingual!</strong>- Runs in English, French and Goblin (NZolzidad!) and other languages can be configured.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e408a781d6c09e0d3acc9088f678d8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["jonathanmcc"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
