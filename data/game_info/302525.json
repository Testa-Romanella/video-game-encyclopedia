Because of this I didn't end up starting work until halfway through the week so really I wasted half my week thinking about what ritual could even be in game form.</p>\n<p>However, this is still my favorite game a week game so far. I really love the atmosphere in this one, however I can see that there is almost no replay value here. This game is the complete opposite of my first week's game in terms of pacing and atmosphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help your character get ready for work by performing their morning ritual in any order you want! This game is best enjoyed with headphones (i think).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a48edafb9f7d33325d11dfcc889dd1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Seiruzan"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
