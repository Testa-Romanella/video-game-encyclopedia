The X coordinate is also used to drive the leaning of the 3D scooter.</p>\n\n<p>The mouse input drives a force on top of the tray to push back the pizza boxes and \"help\" balancing the stack.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I ended up having the 3D pizzas boxes following the animation of the 2D version by assigning the corresponding XY sprites coordinates.<br/>Z is driven by the scooter position and inherits an animated offset when they fall off the scooter to simulate speed.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Credentials - Content not created by me for the game:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music from https://freepd.com/<br/></li><li>SFX from\u00a0https://freesound.org</li><li>Font from https://www.1001freefonts.com/</li></ul>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>Easter Eggs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There is <em>possibly</em> an endless list of integrated bugs that are obviously hidden features the player has to discover.\r\nAmong the few I am aware of:</p>\n<ul><li>Scooter loses restriction in leaning, meaning it can spin forever (woohoo!)</li><li>Retry screen pops for no reason (that I have found yet)</li><li>Buildings are not appearing on the sides of the road (please buy the DLC)</li><li>UI text appears behind the buildings (double negative bug! if the buildings do not appear, the text cannot be behind them)\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:39:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b297e76a4611a44616740346c5c81450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["atnx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
