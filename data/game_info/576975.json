If your heat reaches max you will explode, dealing damage to yourself and anyone close to you.\r\n<strong><br/>Reduce heat:\u00a0</strong>If you do not gain heat for a short time, your heat will cool off faster<br/>\n<strong>Burn:\u00a0</strong>Some of your abilities can apply burn, dealing damage over time. Burn can alter the effect of other abilities\r\n<strong><br/>Healing:</strong> Whenever you hit an enemy that is burning with your<em>\u00a0basic attack,</em>\u00a0you will heal for part of the damage done.\r\n<strong><br/>Unlocking new abilities:</strong> After each wave, you will get to choose from 2 new powerups where\u00a0you can only choose one.\u00a0These powerups can be new \"<em>runic\u00a0abilities</em>\" or<em>\u00a0passive effects</em>\u00a0that makes you stronger. New abilities will replace previous ones in the same slot.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to win:</strong>\r\nThe\u00a0goal of the game\u00a0is to protect the Druid from harm.\u00a0If you are playing any other difficulty than infinite, you win by beating all the waves. If you or the druid dies before the last wave is beaten, you will lose the game and have to try again.\u00a0Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br/>This is a <strong>work in progress\u00a0</strong>and only the first playable demo released to the public.\u00a0<br/><br/>Evergreen is a third person ability-based action-rpg.<br/><br/>Most features are not included in the Alpha.<br/>In the Alpha build we only\u00a0enabled combat, while features such as\u00a0story and progression has been left out for now.<br/><br/>The game has support for multiplayer, but it is very experimental and you should treat it as a single player game. In multiplayer, there will be bugs and most likely lag, but if you want to try be sure to have steam open on your computer or use the same network as your friend(s).<br/><br/>At the moment, we have only released our first map/mission in order for the player to get a taste of the game. In this build you will be able to play as one of the playable characters, the \"<em>Pyromancer</em>\", and you will fight against ranged and melee enemies to defend the \"<em>Druid</em>\", which will be one of the playable characters in a future build.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay footage:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made by:<br/></p>\n<p>Isak Wahl - Programmer</p>\n<p>Johannes Skjeltorp-Borgaas -\u00a0 Programmer</p>\n<p>Christopher Eilertsen - Concept Artist &amp; UI design<br/></p>\n<p>Stefan Rudebjer - 3D Artist &amp; Music Composer<br/></p>\n<p>Carlos Maldonado - Animator</p>\n<p>Marcus Johansen - VFX Artist<br/><br/><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Problem: \"My game has a black screen and is not responding\"<br/>Solution: Try waiting a bit before skipping the cutscene.
