It was made for a few Game Jams.</p>\n<p>You are a bat.\u00a0The aim of the game is to collect as many toffee apples (candies) as you can, avoid the obstacles and Halloween monsters to get to the next level. The\u00a0highest speed I have got to is 190 so far with 199 candies, so see if you can beat that!</p>\n<p>Each time you complete a level, the music, look and speed gets more intense.</p>\n<p>Remember to try out the retro pixelated option.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!!! :)</p>\n<p><em>Note: I ran into a bit of trouble packaging this up and so had to put instructions on using the menu with a keyboard as the mouse clicks are not working for some reason. You can cycle through the buttons\u00a0 by pressing tab to go down (shift tab to go up). Press space/enter to select a button.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T09:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb5/bb58c3c93cd85fa785ac4c0b073f0688.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lazukoanimates"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
