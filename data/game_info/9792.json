{"id": 9792, "slug": "longshot-universe", "name": "Longshot Universe", "name_original": "Longshot Universe", "description": "Longshot Universe is an arena shooter where you take control of a variety of space ships in the far reaches of space to fight it out with the opposing team.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMuch like other MOBA style games you choose a ship and work to take out the enemy base.  However, you build and customize your ship rather than picking from a predetermined set.  Based on your choices you may end up with an agile fighter with access to special flight maneuvers or a large tank able to move in and take the punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile the game is three dimensional, the action takes place on three, two dimensional planes: a high, mid, and a low plane.  The main game play loop is like other MOBA-style games where you must fight your way over to the enemy base and destroy it before the other team destroys yours.  There is also a single player and co-op tower defense mode where you must defend your base against increasing hordes of the enemy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e9eaec58572599ff03e2f1f64a652d0.jpg", "website": "http://longshotuniverse.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 38}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Longshot Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
