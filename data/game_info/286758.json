Made up of 8 rows and 8 columns, the board is populated with fruits as pieces from both players in turn. Each player\u2019s pieces will be a fruit.<br/><br/><br/>How to Play :-<br/><br/>Players battle to finish the game with more of their own pieces on the board than their opponent. The game is classed as finished when there are no spaces left on the board or there are no more possible legal moves for either competitor.<br/><br/><br/>The Start :-<br/><br/>Both players begin the game with two pieces on the board in the four centre squares. No two matching colors are connected vertically or horizontally so a miniature chequered pattern is made.<br/><br/><br/>The Game :-<br/><br/>Both players take it in turns to make their move which consists of placing one piece down in a legally acceptable position and then turning any of the opposing player\u2019s pieces where applicable. A legal move is one that consists of, for example, a piece being placed on the board that creates a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) made up of that piece at either end and only opponent\u2019s pieces in between. When a player achieves this, they must complete the move by turning any opponent\u2019s pieces in between the two of its\u2019 pieces so that they line becomes entirely its' piece color. This turning action must be completed for every legal turning line that is created with the placing of the new piece.<br/><br/>Players will then continue to move alternately until they get to the end of the game and a winner is decided. This decision is reached by identifying which of the two opponents has the most pieces on the board.<br/><br/><br/>Features include :-<br/><br/>1) Simple UI <br/>2) Addictive gameplay <br/>3) Cool music and sound effects <br/>4) Play with AI or with your friends<br/>5) Nice animation <br/>6) No IAP, universal game and awesome gameplay!<br/><br/>Try it yourself!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc549089be95126801963034f511416a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "genres": ["RPG", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
