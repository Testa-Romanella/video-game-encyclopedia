Interrogate passers-by, cybernetic droids, robots or zonards by defeating the traps of the Mafia and its abuses.<br/><br/>Visit incredible parallel worlds in Real / Semi-Real / Semi-Virtual or Full Virtual mode to restore the matrix variations from which the Matrix suffers.<br/><br/><strong>Opus 2 : The Era of Renewal </strong><br/><br/>Welcome to Utopia (one and the same nation \"the<br/><br/>cited \"world\", with only one is the same capital<br/><br/>\"Utopia\" international market<br/><br/>major cities of the five continents.),<br/><br/>vast flying technopole.<br/><br/><br/>In the distant future, we are in the era of<br/><br/>Renewal, which follows the Cyberpunk era (which<br/><br/>takes place in the near future) where the first happens<br/><br/>opus from the game \"Utopia-RPG.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>During the Cyber-punk era, the world sinks into a<br/><br/>terrible decay (overcrowding, disasters<br/><br/>ecological, natural and energy resources<br/><br/>almost exhausted, malnutrition, ill-distributed wealth,<br/><br/>gaps in social disparities, civil revolution,<br/><br/>armed conflicts, etc.) and at the same time, the<br/><br/>technology makes a giant leap in all<br/><br/>areas of human knowledge (I-a, IT,<br/><br/>medicine, cyborg, robotization, etc.)<br/><br/><br/>Following this, during the Renewal era, the world<br/><br/>slowly rises from the ashes.<br/><br/>Little by little, technological progress is such<br/><br/>that ecological solutions are found for<br/><br/>improve the lot of the earthly population.<br/><br/>The world is slowly emerging from the deep coma in which<br/><br/>he was immersed.<br/><br/><br/>Under the effect of global warming,<br/><br/>most of the globe is fled underwater.<br/><br/>(It is for this reason, moreover, that you can<br/><br/>find that the adventure card contains<br/><br/>many islets in the middle of the ocean ...)<br/><br/><br/>What is more, there is more or less in all<br/><br/>fields, whether artistic, architectural,<br/><br/>scientific, technological, etc. A return to style<br/><br/>artistic ancient (future-ancient) or middle age<br/><br/>fantastic (medieval-futuristic.)<br/><br/><br/>It is not necessarily yet very visible to our<br/><br/>present time or even in the near future ...<br/><br/>But in the more or less long term, we will get there.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Some examples ... </strong><br/><br/>- The first electric cars no longer make<br/><br/>noises.<br/><br/>- Cars are flying and therefore less cars<br/><br/>in the streets (see not at all.)<br/><br/>- We are now designing farm buildings,<br/><br/>several floors, to use fewer areas<br/><br/>terrestrial, which leaves more room for trees and<br/><br/>to vegetation.<br/><br/>- Technologies are becoming more and more<br/><br/>miniature, therefore invisible and soundproof, which makes<br/><br/>think a little bit about techno-magic.<br/><br/>- Dress fashion sometimes reminds us of a comeback<br/><br/>in the past.<br/><br/>- Energy resources have also changed<br/><br/>(fossil fuels are becoming scarce, giving way<br/><br/>to more ecological energies ...)<br/><br/>- The buildings are becoming greener, asking<br/><br/>building materials closer to the<br/><br/>nature (wood-based building, building with walls<br/><br/>floral, etc.)<br/><br/>- Etc. Etc. These are just a few examples ...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Between two attitudes, sometimes ravaged, sometimes<br/><br/>rising from the ashes, the world has come to<br/><br/>the era of Renewal and it is in this universe that<br/><br/>play your game.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Virtual Worlds </strong><br/><br/>In the near future, computers have been replaced<br/><br/>by projection headsets which allow<br/><br/>reconstruct everything the five senses can<br/><br/>pretend to control machines remotely and<br/><br/>project in a matrix in semi real, semi mode<br/><br/>virtual or full virtual.<br/><br/>Sometimes the virtual has implications for the world<br/><br/>real and vice versa, so that it can<br/><br/>cause disruption.<br/><br/>It is therefore possible to walk in worlds<br/><br/>virtual. The most common of them is a world<br/><br/>fantastic medieval, which you can access<br/><br/>to accomplish your mission.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Some game tips :</strong><br/><br/>- Regularly save your game.<br/><br/>- At level 1 some \"big monsters\" are too difficult<br/><br/>to fight. We must therefore flee (key 0 to return<br/><br/>basic menu) while waiting to get stronger.<br/><br/>- Bring a notebook and a pencil to take notes.<br/><br/>Note which places have already been visited, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Content of the two games :</strong><br/><br/>- Over 100 Monsters<br/><br/>- Several hundred objects, weapons and armor<br/><br/>- About ten career levels<br/><br/>- Many maps very well done<br/><br/>- Forty puzzles<br/><br/>- 4 Game Modes (Real, Semi-Real, Semi-Virtual, Virtual)<br/><br/>- A hectic story, many hours of play.<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Christophe Vanhille", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T20:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/200/2007ed775d19b1c0b2aa146bcd0b3409.jpg", "website": "https://reel-futur.forumactif.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christophe Vanhille"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Christophe Vanhille"], "esrb_rating": null}
