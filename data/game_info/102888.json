{"id": 102888, "slug": "layer-lady", "name": "Layer Lady", "name_original": "Layer Lady", "description": "<p>Layer Lady is a game inspired by the 2017 Famicase entry for a game called 'Loop Girl' (http://famicase.com/17/softs/002.html). It inspired me to create a platformer where you collect gameboy-like devices and play multiple characters at the same time, trying to keep most of them alive. There are 25 levels to go through and tons of coins to collect, can you get to level 25 and keep Layer Ladies alive?</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move! If your most recently created Layer Lady dies, it's game over! Otherwise you can keep progressing and collect coins!</p>\n<ul><li>Funny Chase by @wyver9</li><li>Tileset by\u00a0Paulo Vin\u00edcius Moreira Dutra</li><li>Layer Lady sprites by Dishtron</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e69/e6942352d9da56505971a3ede35d8f18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
