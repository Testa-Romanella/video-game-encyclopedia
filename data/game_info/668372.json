{"id": 668372, "slug": "solar-system-msu", "name": "Solar System - MSU", "name_original": "Solar System - MSU", "description": "<p>Created by Lynn Wright</p>\n<p>This is my solar system project for my Games and Interactivity\u00a0class at MSU. Throughout this project, I learned the basics of Unity and made a model of the Solar System using Unity's many tools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping it at the base \"at least three planets\" requirement, I made all of the planets (except for Pluto) because it felt wrong not to. I\u00a0also messed around with the lighting a bit to try and get less shading\u00a0on the sun (shadows on the sun are pretty unrealistic)\u00a0and to make it look like the sun was emitting light. I added a halo to the sun to give it that extra\u00a0<em>flare </em>(get it?). I\u00a0made three moons: Earth's moon and both of Mars' moons and reused Mercury and Pluto's texture for Deimos and Phobos. I\u00a0made the comet's capsules instead of spheres because I\u00a0thought it looked a little too out of place.</p>\n<p>Not really a modification, but I wanted to note that I made the comets appear a little less frequently than in the tutorial (around 10 second spawn rate) because I wanted it to feel a little more special. In addition, the only planets with sound are the three gas giants because otherwise there would be a constant droning noise that was kind of annoying and made seeing a planet pass by feel less interesting. I also felt that it made more sense to limit the amount of sound a planet made because the ones closer to the sun were much much farther away than the ones that passed the main camera.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876f1536ec1f50eff8d8fc34dc8d234a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["lynnmwrigh"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
