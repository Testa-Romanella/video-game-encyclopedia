Even if this city we live in is cold and dark. I believe that if you lead us prudently and strategically in this turn-based city, you can achieve such an positive about luck. And our team count on you.<br/> -Team Goetita<h3> Warning </h3>The mechanics of this game may feel unfamiliar and complicated. This game cannot proceed by a simple dash.<h3> Features </h3>Synergy is created when a character uses an ally's skill. When a character uses her skill, normal reinforcement effects are applied, But when using a colleague's skill, the colleague's features and her features are combined. You can also adjust the width of reinforcement by using multiple cards.<br/><br/><br/>First, all characters check the situation and then move the position. Therefore, the actual range she can move, does not match the range expressed that it can be moved at the first click. Because of this, if they are behind a wall, enemies also tend not to come to attack them easily because enemies do not have a clear line of sight.<br/><br/>It is good not to sound the alarm. In the case of enemies, when the alarm sounds, they tend to unite, and when the alarm is released, they spread out and search again. And the first enemy it finds doesn't attack immediately, but any nearby enemies do. Also, if the alarm goes, the enemies take a more aggressive stance.<br/><br/>There is maintenance fee. If the maintenance cost is low, the HP will decrease slowly, but it will not decrease below 1, so you can try to recover. If you are buying something, leave some extra money.<br/><br/>Normal damage and random damage are separate. As you take risks, increase the width of random damage and increase normal damage for stable operation. It is designed to be linked with skills. <br/><br/>16:9 16:10 are supported resolution.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T21:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc4977974412c4870bd6a40134bf941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["AigoiA"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Oidoi Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
