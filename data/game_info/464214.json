The catch is, your bullets repeatedly bounce off all walls, quickly turning the room into a prime example of bullet hell. Defeat all enemies to complete the level before you inadvertently kill yourself.</p>\n<p>Where getting a minigun is a life saver in other games, it is a death sentence here.</p>\n<p>And of course, the recoil of shooting pushes you back.
