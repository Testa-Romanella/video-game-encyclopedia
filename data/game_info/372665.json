The weapons are:<br/>\r\n1. Gun<br/>\r\n2. Cannon<br/>\r\n3. Missile<br/>\r\n4. Ice<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt seems a game too simple but it is not, since there are certain elements that increase its difficulty:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n1.The game is very fast and with each round also increases the difficulty, so the more progress the more difficult it will be.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. Large numbers will break down into small ones when they die, having to destroy them several times<br/>\n<br/>\r\n3.The small size of the stage means that many times you can bump into the edge and die, as well as with the rotating objects on the map.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T03:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d6/7d6f264d06b30a5bbcd277570b0053cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dexion Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dexion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
