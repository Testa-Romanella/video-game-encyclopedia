No enemies, no points, no time limit, no collectibles, only jumping! But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have an easy time!<br/>\r\nAll levels filled up with platforms randomly, and those platforms are tricky. one can change its length, the other its visibility but there is also one that changes its position. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you choose a difficulty level you decide how many lives you start the game with. But beware, because one mistake is one life, and there is 40+ levels in the main game! Your progress will be saved automatically, but just locally. Steam Cloud isn't available.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is developed by one person. Except for music. All music track is created by Eric Matyas.
