The government has switched from physical currency to physical debt. To tax citizens, the U.S. now simply sends them a bunch of physical debt dollars. Instead of illegally taking people's money, criminals now illegally give people money. You play as a criminal throwing debt dollars at people while trying not to get caught.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong><br/>Use the WASD keys to walk and left click to throw debt.
