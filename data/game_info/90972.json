Getting through the day, through all days, feels more quietly exhausting than ever before.</p><p>But there is something, you think, would help you recover. Would help you feel like you've really rested, relaxed, and recovered for the first time in months.</p><p>It's your own personal secret, but you truly believe it would help: Sleeping inside of a dragon's stomach. Just for a little while, long enough to relax. It's the only thing you've been able to think about.</p><p>You've found the dragon, but the thing is: She's not going to eat you just because you want her to.</p><p>You have to talk to her. And open up to her.</p><p><em>A relaxation focused vore twine, about trust and vulnerability.</em><br/></p><p><em>This is a SOFT VORE game - no teeth, no biting, no blood, no messiness, and no digestion.
