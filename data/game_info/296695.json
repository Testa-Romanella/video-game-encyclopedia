Use\u00a0the features of the terrain\u00a0to create the ultimate defence against the incoming invaders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will you outsmart the larger enemy force? Will you be able to defend your country against an incoming horde? Or maybe you just want to see how far you can push our game while playing co-op...<br/></p>\n<p>Strategic depth is still in development and we are looking for feedback and suggestions to make the game as polished as possible. Also, if you encounter any problems, feel free to reach out!\r\nWe will be releasing a new build every week on Saturday.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Only controllers are supported (keyboard and mouse support will be added soon). The game supports local coop of up to 2 players.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Nikita Kotter -\u00a0Team Leader,\u00a0Designer, Programmer, 3D Modeler &amp; Producer</p>\n<p>Charlie Gillies - Programmer</p>\n<p>Micha\u0142 Puka\u0142a -Sound Designer &amp; Music Composer\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/8268443c0d94462f7e2a34c22b38ab52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikita Kotter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
