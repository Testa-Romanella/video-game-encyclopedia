That storm left people broken, terrified out of their minds, and questioning not only their existence, but the very fabric of reality itself. That storm came in the form of a masterpiece of horror game design. That storm was the Spindly Man triology.</p>\n<p><strong>=== What is Spindly Man? ===</strong></p>\n<p>Spindly Man is a horror game with a heavy focus on story telling and building a compelling universe full of colourful characters, and concepts unlike any other. Spindly Man was an episodic series in which every new release progressed the depth of the lore &amp; the complexity of the design, making every release make the last seem small in comparison.</p>\n<p><strong>=== Reviews ===</strong></p>\n<p>\"This game is a massive overhaul from the first game adding a lot more complexity and plot. This game is no longer the running dick joke...\"<br/>-TheTeeJayW</p>\n<p>\"5/5 It left me speechless and craving for more\"<br/>-DGaming</p>\n<p>\"That part with Bliss Bot was real funny and that ending with spindly man had the best music\"<br/>-NachoDogGaming</p>\n<p>\" 5/5 for your funny, creepy, scary awesome game :)\"<br/>-RostigerRentner</p>\n<p>\"I have to say, Spindly Man is my favorite anime as of now\"<br/>-DGaming</p>\n<p>\"The way how I feel about Bulge-Boy's games is that they're really inspiring... He doesn't care about all the graphics or put a whole lot of money into his projects he just does it because he enjoys it and that's the amazing thing about this creator.\"<br/>-HeZoKo</p>\n<p>\"Once in a lifetime game. Must play, 10/10, 1337 HAX0R. Would recommend to buy for a friend's brother's best man at his wedding.\"<br/>-Spoonage</p>\n<p>\"It's just one of those retarded kind of games that you can't help but love\"<br/>-TheSoreLoserGamers</p>\n<p>\"It's a good effort I guess, son\" - My dad :)</p>\n<p>(Disclaimer: Unlike a lot of things stated here, these reviews aren't actually a joke. These are real quotes from real people).</p>\n<p><strong>=== Sounds Absoluetly Mint ===</strong></p>\n<p>Right you are!</p>\n<p><strong>=== Okay, now, tell the truth. What is Spindly Man? ===</strong></p>\n<p>Alright you got me. The Spindly Man triology was a set of joke horror games released in 2017 - early 2018 that were created with extremely low effort in hopes to troll some people just looking for a good, spooky horror game to play. But, after uploading the first one, I never actually really intended to make another one (even though the ending of Spindly Man 1 stated \"To Be Continued\". I just didn't care enough). But, shortly after uploading the game there began to be YouTube let's plays that popped up of people playing Spindly Man. This blew me away. I was completely dazed by how many people put in the effort to play and record a terrible joke game created with the intention to troll. This gave me a sudden rush of motivation to create a bigger, better second one. Then, when the second one attracted even more people then the first, and also got onto the front page of Gamejolt, I then made a third.</p>\n<p>So that's it. These games are ancient relics from the past and represent a good starting point for me as a creator of joke games. I hope you enjoy.</p>\n<p>#comedy\u00a0#adventure\u00a0#puzzle\u00a0#pointnclick\u00a0#storyrich\u00a0#Icried\u00a0#emotional\u00a0#story\u00a0#pointandclick\u00a0#funny\u00a0#atmospheric\u00a0#readingsimulator\u00a0#visualnovel\u00a0#twisted\u00a0#surreal\u00a0#horror\u00a0#action</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa311f6e427d1430386915283fa6f833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bulge-Boy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
