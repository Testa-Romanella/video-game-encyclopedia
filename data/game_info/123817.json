One team has to infiltrate a site, while the other has to defend it. The game is about hidden information and moving in a way that leaves you hidden visually and acoustically.</p>\r\n\r\nVersions\r\n<p>Sadly I did not finish this game in time for the jam deadline (at all). Therefore I uploaded two \"demo\" versions.</p>\n<p>One does not have multiplayer, but is a good demo of the sound system and the movement/attacks.<br/></p>\n<p>The other does have some sort of multiplayer, but a lot of functionality is missing. Specifically:</p>\n<ul><li>Taking damage from other players' sword hits</li><li>Destroying breakable walls</li><li>Being able to disconnect</li><li>Synchronization is missing in some places</li><li>The objective :/</li><li>Rounds, the score, dieing and respawning</li></ul>\n<p>You can try the singleplayer only version to try out the movement and sound occlusion/attenuation (left click moves the listener) and the multiplayer version sneak up on or hide from each other!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You can toggle the console with F8. Type \"help\" to see the available commands.<br/></p>\n<p>You can place the listener with by clicking with your left mouse button in the singleplayer version or in spectator mode in the multiplayer version.</p>\n<p>In the multiplayer version, let everyone connect to your server (start a game in 'Host' mode), then change the map by typing \"<em>map firsttest</em>\" or \"<em>map foyer</em>\" (even more placeholder than firsttest) in the server console. <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>If no gamepad is plugged in, keyboard controls will be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad:</strong> <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left Stick: Move</li><li>Hold Triggers: Sprint (more noise!)</li><li>A: Jump (press shortly for a shorter, quieter jump)</li><li>X: Attack</li><li>Shoulder Buttons: Dash (dash into walls and ceilings to grab them and climb! cancel it early to make no noise!)</li><li>Y: Use (open doors)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move</li><li>Left ctrl: Sprint</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>J: Attack</li><li>Left shift: Dash</li><li>E: Use</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Shared:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>F8: Toggle console</li><li>F11: Toggle fullscreen</li></ul>\r\nFinal notes\r\n<p>My project was very ambitious and I did not make it in time, though I think the idea is really cool! I will keep working on it and upload a post-jam version that is a game you can actually play hopefully very soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/1480d785a58b63da4836b8a6f66bd1a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pfirsich"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
