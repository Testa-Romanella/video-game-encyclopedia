You are never able to see everything, the faster you move, the less you see. It's a game of tactic, do you want to rush, but risk getting caught? Or you want to go slow and scan the surroundings first? The choice is in your hands!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I designed Break Out Plan, to have two play styles. First the more stealth-like, going slow and peeking around corners. And the second, quite challenging, running through the level and knocking out guards with perfectly timed dashes, that will reward more dedicated and experienced players. Yous as a player controls the phase of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for the Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3 based on a theme: Less is more. So I created a stealth game about trading less speed for more vision. When it comes to graphic style I went for a blueprint like. I imagined how some real agents are planning their strategy before a mission, and that's what are you playing. All the sprites, music, and scripts were made by myself and within the time limit of 7 days.</p>\n<p><strong>For the best experience is recommended the downloadable version.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e438d2a5b2f14fd45638051d7f9ceaac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EdenSoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
