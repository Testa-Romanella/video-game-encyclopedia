The first 2 levels are complete and the 3rd level needs a little more work, but I couldn't find the time to finish the last level.\u00a0This is the first game I've ever made, so I'll appreciate all the feedback I can get. It would mean so much to me if you take the time to give my game a try. It only takes about 10 minutes to finish it. Thank you for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not own any of the models featured in the game. They are all free assets that I found from the amazing creators of Sketchfab and Unity Asset Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T04:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c107a9ef7f42b60db0ed1db9e8116b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pseudo Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
