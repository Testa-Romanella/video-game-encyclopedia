Launch balloons and probes to explore the planet while harvesting resources from the atmosphere. Build up your colony and thrive in a simulation based on real science. Venus awaits.<br/><br/><h3>It began as a research station, but it became so much more\u2026</h3><br/><strong>Sky Base Venus</strong> is a colony simulation set in the upper atmosphere of Venus. You have been sent to manage a floating research station there, but political turmoil will soon cause your support from Earth to diminish over time. While still pursuing your original research mission, you will need to make self-sufficiency a priority if you want to survive in the long term.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fortunately for you, your station is designed to be able to harvest and process resources from Venus\u2019s atmosphere, which you can use to satisfy your colony\u2019s needs and even to manufacture needed goods.  But providing for yourself won\u2019t be the only challenge. Disasters, defects in your equipment, and changing priorities on the part of your Earth-based sponsors will all require you to adapt.<br/><br/>But if you can handle all of these problems, you may even be able to grow your colony, expand your operations, and make this station into more than anyone thought it would be.<br/><br/><h3>Key Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Based upon real-life science</strong> \u2013 Gameplay draws upon real-life research that suggests a floating crewed station at altitudes from 50-61km is feasible.<br/></li><li><strong>In-Situ Resource Utilization</strong> \u2013 Gather materials from Venus\u2019s atmosphere and process them in order to provide your colony with things from oxygen and water to plastic products.<br/></li><li><strong>Budget Resources Wisely</strong> \u2013 Buy new machines to harvest resources, or buy the resources themselves.  Pursue research projects that require lots of resources but give significant rewards, or economize and stick with cheaper projects that yield less.  And be especially careful with resources that have to be shipped from Earth \u2013 at great cost.<br/></li><li><strong>Randomized Research</strong> \u2013 The research projects available to you are randomized, and their feasibility, time, and cost may vary from one playthrough to another.  You also won\u2019t always know the time or cost of these projects at their outset \u2013 you\u2019ll have to balance the risk involved versus the potential reward.<br/></li><li><strong>Disasters and Design Defects </strong>\u2013 Your colony may face serious accidents.  But even worse, your colony\u2019s systems may have randomly-determined design defects that are unknown at the start of the game and whose effects may last.  Each playthrough will bring different challenges.<br/></li><li><strong>Altitude Matters</strong> \u2013 Should you float higher to get more solar energy, or float lower to be able to carry more weight?  It\u2019s up to you.<br/></li><li><strong>Space Logistics</strong> \u2013 You can order new equipment and goods from Earth, but these things can only be shipped during realistic transfer windows, and can take over a hundred Earth days to arrive.  You\u2019ll need to plan your shipments carefully to avoid shortages.</li></ul><br/>Wishlist and follow now!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T06:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73e14d626ff2a8d73f7ff25c14972b27.jpg", "website": "https://rara-avis-interactive.com/title/sky-base-venus/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rara Avis Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Rara Avis Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
