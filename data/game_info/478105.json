{"id": 478105, "slug": "winds-of-time", "name": "Winds of Time", "name_original": "Winds of Time", "description": "<p>A game made for the Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam (Theme: Rewind)<br/></p>\n<p>As an avatar of the God of Time and Wind itself, defend your sanctuary against a great fleet assembled by the King Xerxes.\u00a0<br/>Using the powers at your disposal and the island conditions, you must make sure the invaders are pushed back to sea. Time your attack right, or if you fail, rewind!</p><p><strong>Detailed explanation of your powers:</strong></p><p>The first power \"wind\" will send a storm at the ships, which will damage them a bit, push them to\u00a0delay them (useful to keep a lot of them under the eruption for example), \u00a0and can be used to crash them against each other or against the terrain for maximum damage.</p>\n<p>The second power \"fire\" will damage and has a good chance to\u00a0set your target on fire, which will apply continous damage to the target.</p>\n<p>The third power \"warp\" sends your target back in time, to the state it was in,\u00a0between 2 to 3 \"hours\" ago (150 to 200 seconds back). Using it at the game start won't be very useful since the ships won't have moved that much, but during \"midgame\" and \"endgame\", it allows you to break their formation, and easily destroy the larger ships for example.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer's Note:</strong></p><p>Even though I'm quite proud of what I could accomplish in a week, and to finally having \"finished\" a prototype (it has a primary loop at least :) ), I regret not having the time to polish stuff some more (animations, textures, sounds, maybe some more story, events, or even cutscenes?). If you guys like that first draft, I might continue developing it!<br/>This prototype allowed me to experiment more with AI Navigation, (a lot!) with particle systems, some physics, and I was even starting to look into rigging my eagle model!<br/>Even though the goal was kinda reached, the journey was the best part, hope you enjoy it as well!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/809/8098d32f53380bea7a2e049b803480d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kay14"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
