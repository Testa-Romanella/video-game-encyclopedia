I present you, the very early testing of - Dungeon Run: Rise of the Goblins. Made 100% with blueprints in Unreal Engine 4,\u00a0it has quite some content waiting to be dwelled in! Choose either to play the Storyline or if you are feeling brave, jump into the Random Dungeon mode.</p>\n<p>Dungeon Run: Rise of the Goblins is a third-person singleplayer dungeon crawler/RPG/fantasy game where you play as a greedy Goblin and seek to reach the Sky Dome. To get to there, you must break through the chains of Ragazor and destroy the entities crawling in the dungeons while the realm you are in is getting corrupted by their servants. You can select to be either a goblin\u00a0warrior, gladiator, or a warlock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Explore procedurally generated dungeons while testing your luck opening chests, hoping for juicy loot. Fight the leaders of Ragazor while the fights get\u00a0more and more advanced as you progress. Feeling tired? Go on a chill exploration session, just beware of the creatures in OR out of the dungeons. Wildlife included.</p>\n<p>Of course this is a very early testing build and the storyline is not complete yet. I tried to make it sound as good as I could!\u00a0However I slowly need to get back into work so I decided to share this project here. So what are you waiting for? Download the zip and enjoy the content. Feel free to let me know what you think about my solo-work on this project. I appreciate every feedback.</p>\n<p>Possible bugs/issues\u00a0in this build:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Bow cooldown on warrior/gladiator can get bugged (just display, no effect on gameplay)</li><li>Current build does not save mouse settings (sensitivity/invert mode). Everything else gets saved as intended.</li><li>The warlock class is not really stable, however I decided to make it playable just so it can be experienced!</li><li>Looting Explosive Potion from the ground can be a pain in the ass sometimes.\u00a0</li><li>Random dungeon mode is W.I.P however it is somewhat stable in this build. Maybe some random bosses might not behave as intended.</li><li>Objective system is early W.I.P</li></ul>\n<p>Final note:</p>\n<p>Nothing you play is final in this build. It's the first ever Early Testing build I'm releasing. There is so much room for improvement and content, and I'm happily open for any feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T11:09:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81feb103c14eb6948a3c2797ac6618a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ISIK Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
