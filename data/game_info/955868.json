It is a heels-over-head fall. It is an <em>over-a-minute-has-passed-and-you're-still-falling</em> fall.</p>\n<p>You are hurtling into darkness so thick you cannot even see your fingers in front of your own eyes. The air tingles with a strange energy that envelops you entirely as you fall, providing you with the sensation of tumbling through mist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You fall and fall and fall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You survive your fall.</p>\n<p>You are injured. . . bleeding. . .\u00a0<em>dying</em>. . . but alive.</p>\n<p>You have fallen into a dark underground that is as silent and lifeless as a grave. There is only you, your heartbeat, and your shadow. With your current state, you're in no shape to even attempt to climb back out. You must push forward and hope to find another way up.</p>\n<p>What you find is nothing like you expected.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:\u00a0</strong>Undertale belongs to Toby Fox.
