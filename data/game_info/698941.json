Three tracks await you, each ready to test your mettle with their own unique layout and theme\u00a0. Easy to learn, difficult to perfect!</p>\n<p>This bus is exclusively\u00a0manual transmission, as all racing should be - if you're not familiar with how to use a clutch, don't worry, it's easy! Let go of the gas, hold down on the clutch, and shift up or down as your little heart desires, and then release the clutch - it's really that easy! I promise, it'll make the racing experience that much more engaging and satisfying to master!<br/></p>\n<p>Desert Bus Speedway was designed and developed in one week for the Desert Bus for Hope 2021 Game\u00a0Jam. Due to whosever twisted soul submitted this year's theme of \"Long Haul\", I have added and painstakingly playtested the 50 lap Long Haul mode for each level. For any masochists\u00a0I mean, <em>racing enthusiasts</em> out there, try to beat the Long Haul mode on all three levels!</p><p><strong>Keep In Touch</strong><br/></p><p>Follow along with any future projects in the works by joining the Imaginary Game\u00a0Studios Discord server!</p><p>https://discord.gg/fJJfRuYtpR</p><p>Not a Discord user?
