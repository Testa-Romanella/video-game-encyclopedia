The gameplay itself is quite simple and makes as much sense to the player as it confuses the general game consumer.</p>\n<p>Since the gameplay consists of very aestethical perfomences the application can be compared to other alternative music and beat generators/sequencers.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile being a very narrow concept, the versatile aspects of the game ranges wide, not just only directly pointed towards musicans and therefore very appealing to both ordinary video gamers and indiviuals not familiar with interactive environments.</p>\n<p>Four fundamental elements that is distinguishing for Dublynx is:</p>\n<p>* Creativeness - Create unique variations of different samples, puzzled together.</p>\n<p>* Innovation - Do not just experience a virtual world - be part of its making!\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Unconditional - Since the game has no meaning, neither an end, a gaming session goes on as long as the player desires it.</p>\n<p>* Freedom - The world moves around you;\u00a0drift wherever you please.</p>\n<p>Play as either <em>Rasho </em>the demon engine, to explore the frequencies of dubstep, or <em>Ollio </em>the elephant, to experience the sound of dub.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Aestethical Features</strong></p>\n<p>With a touch of mid southern asian sub cultures combined with carribean rastafari colours, mixed with old school wildstyle graffiti, the player gets to venture through a surrealistic world, consisting of what so ever one's imagination can make up.</p>\n<p>Implicitly, the music is a vital factor in the game. Depending on playing style the player gets to choose between either a dubstep or just plain dub oriented avatar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gameplay is parable to the making of a music video, however, now with the interactiveness added.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Staff</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Dublynx\u00a0</em>was developed and released as a result of a 10 week development cycle by sophomore students of the University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden,\u00a0during the second quarter of\u00a02011.
