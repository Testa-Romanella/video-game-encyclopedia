I\u00a0 just discovered\u00a0PICO-8 and decided to use it to\u00a0learn how to program. I found a copy of PICO-zine #1 and decided to tackle the beginner tutorial for making a single player pong. It was pretty tricky in the beginning, but I was having fun, so I carried on.\u00a0Then things got out of hand...\u00a0</p>\n<p>I started expanding on the stuff from the tutorial. I always was interested in procedural generation, so one of the first things I added was randomly spawning bricks and turn the game from a pong-like to more of a breakout. It was still not really that fun to play, so I spent a bunch of time researching and tweaking the paddle physics. In the end, I think have two of them - one based on where the ball hits the paddle, and one based on the velocity of the paddle.</p>\n<p>Even that the better mechanics\u00a0made it OK to play, I thought I needed some \"unique selling point.\" After all, no\u00a0one really wants to play a breakout nowadays and I wanted\u00a0 at least some people to play my game. This is where I came up with the the narrative. You are not playing a breakout. No! You are an IT professional in 198X using this action data recovery system (which I imagined like some kind of cyber-deck) to fix an infected computer.\u00a0 The points you collect are the amount of bits of data you recover.</p>\n<p>This is where the art style came from. The fact that you can access the raw data in PICO-8 to glitch the display was a great added bonus! I have spent much more time on getting the visuals just right. This was a lot of checking other people's code (a great feature of PICO-8 is that you can see the source code of games you download, and many of them are under CC license) and trying to decipher #tweetjam carts.\u00a0As I was working on implementing more visuals, more narrative ideas showed up. Maybe I can represent the \"viruses\" you \"fight\"? (I did, each virus modifies the gameplay when the timer runs out or a V power-down is picked up. BRE3D-V8\u00a0is my favorite).Maybe I can even add boss battles? Suddenly I had ideas for more games in the same universe, but you play as a virus this time and it is a platformer? Or, maybe you are a computer program and it is a puzzle game?</p>\n<p>This is where I got distracted. I started implementing bosses, but wanted to work on other stuff (including non-programming stuff) and never got to\u00a0finishing this first game of mine. Now it seems like a mess of code that would be difficult to decipher, but maybe one day I will find will and time to do it.\u00a0Nevertheless, I am still proud of my first programming achievement. I hope you'll enjoy it too...</p>\n<p>If you want to see my programming journey on this project\u00a0in more detail, I kept a dev-log on a blog.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T04:28:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e55f574a58391738e3963fdbf84e567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VonBednar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
