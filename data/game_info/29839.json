It takes place in a fantastic version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.<br />\nThe game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert&#39;s frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character&#39;s death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T12:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/951/951f914b28b246835a811894bbc38403.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 4.34, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 21, "owned": 90, "beaten": 164, "toplay": 49, "dropped": 32, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 179, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 181, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Atari ST", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA CD", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Lucasfilm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Lucasfilm Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
