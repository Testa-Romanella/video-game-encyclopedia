One side belong to color of one player and other belongs to second player. Each player has to put coins (facing up on their side) next to any coin on board (facing up to opponent's side) such that an array of opponent's coins are captured between two of your coins. The captured coins are then flipped. If no such move exists then pass the turn to other player, but if it exists then chance can't be passed.<br/>When board is filled or both players are out of legal moves, then the player having most coins facing up on his/her side wins.<br/>(links for more information)<br/>https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Othello<br/>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi</p>\n<p>Credits-<br/>game dev :<br/>-&gt; rikkoder (: me :)<br/><br/>background music :<br/>-&gt; Music: \u201cChamber of Secrets\u201d, from PlayOnLoop.com (Licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T07:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b1e80806795a69ac62ed5bc78172239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["rikku"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
