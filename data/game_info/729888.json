This game is a \"Boss rush\" that will test your skills, and if you can eliminate all the shattered souls, you will have a chance to fight the Death King to restore life. As an undead bounty hunter you are bestowed with the power of light and dark. Specific enemies will require a different approach from both sides of the divine/ evil spectrum. If you are lucky enough to survive until the end, you must unite both powers to defeat the death king.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87dee047ca5ca050549777b34d0c82bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["danielfisher3DMedia"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
