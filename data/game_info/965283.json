Playing as either the brother or sister (who has been cursed with a dick) you must explore the mansion looking for a way to escape while avoiding getting caught and resisting temptation from lewd traps.</p>\n<p>Like the dev&#39;s previous game all scenes in this are animated.</p>\n<p>Controls: Standard RPGMaker Controls<br />\nZ - Action/Confirm<br />\nX - Cancel/Menu<br />\nA - Fire Weapon<br />\nUp/Down/Left/Right keys - Movement/Menu navigation/Quick time events<br />\nShift - Run/Walk depending on if auto run is enabled or not</p>\n<p>On standard difficulty the stuff you need to find is not marked so you will need to press Z on everything, later versions of the game include an easier mode that highlight points of interest. Difficulty can be changed using the personal mirror item found on the desk just outside the prison cells.<br />\nSome objects need to be attacked with certain weapons to breakdown/activate.<br />\nGetting caught will lower your sanity which starts at 10 to a minimum of 0, you can raise it again by sharing sweets with your sibling, some dialogue/events depend on the sanity level being low or high.</p>\n<p>Playing as the sister will modify the scenes to add more boobs and change dialogue slightly, she also has a standing pic in some scenes that can be turned on or off using the mirror in her prison cell.</p>\n<p>Fetishes: Femdom, Female on Male/Dick Girl Rape, Money Drain</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T02:43:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86f/86fdf6e6cc91d12691094415ed91cfde.jpg", "website": "https://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=/product_id/RJ365442.html/?locale=en_US", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
