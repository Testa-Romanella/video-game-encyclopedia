You can move, jump, and \"die\".<br/></p><p>Now features two more cameras to overcome, and a right pit where you can fall and be returned to the start point for faster testing.</p><p>Added a menu at start, and different songs in start and game, with an intro and loop in the game section.</p><p>Added a platforming section with sliders for the different movement-involved variables, in case anyone is uncomfortable and wants to try fiddling with it, if you do please do share your thoughts in the comments, and possibly a screenshot with what you went for!</p><p>Platforming section unaccessible for now as I rework the movement physics again.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Left and Right keys or A and D for movement</p><p>Space for Jump</p><p>Alt+F4 or equivalent in other OSs to exit as I introduced no menu or key to exit, sorry about that.</p><p>Last upload: 01 December 2016, 16:12 GMT+1</p><p>Please redownload if you last downloaded it before this time and want to have the latest iteration! Thank you so much!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LoboRundas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
