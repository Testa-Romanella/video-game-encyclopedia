You have limited resources, and your only weapon takes a while to load and has to be used strategically.\r\n</p>\n<p>You have a revolver, but in order to use it, you must manually insert bullets into the chamber, choosing from different bullet types and inserting them in the desired order. Use the right elemental combos to exploit enemy weaknesses!\r\n</p>\r\nPREMISE\r\n<p>Someone believed that there is much more power that can be extracted from the 8\u00a0chakras than what people usually do, and they started conducting experiments. This led to a massive explosion of power within the entire facility. The power of chakras transcended beyond the physical bodies of everyone at the facility, leaving them hollow, mindless and corrupted, and their bodies slowly degrading or twisting and stretching into strange shapes.\r\n</p>\n<p>The power of chakras is now free-floating on the premises. As the only employee who survived the catastrophe, you spent days in hiding, deep inside the facility, not knowing what happened. With no food or water left, you must go out of your hiding and escape!\r\n</p>\n<p>Your only defence is a\u00a0gun prototype that you worked on, that is able to capture the energy, fuse it with a bullet and release it back.\r\n</p>\r\nPROJECT GOAL\r\n<p>The goal of this project was to create a playable vertical slice of an original game concept, consisting of a single 10-20 minute long level and a small number of enemies and bullet types (2-4), that would serve as a\u00a0<em>proof of concept</em>, showing the core mechanics and aesthetics of the game.\r\n</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Download and unzip the build, then launch TrigramGame.exe. The only currently supported platform is Windows PC.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nMove\r\nWASD\r\nRotate camera\r\nMouse\r\nShoot\r\nLMB\r\nAim down sight\r\nRMB<em>\u00a0(hold)</em>\r\nToggle reload\r\nR\u00a0\r\nInsert normal bullet\r\nQ\r\nInsert elemental bullets\r\n123\r\nPause game\r\nP / Esc\r\nMenu button/action\r\nLMB\r\n\r\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<ul><li>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8300H CPU @ 2.30GHz (or equivalent)\r\n</li><li>RAM: 8 GB\r\n</li><li>Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 (or equivalent)\r\n</li><li>Disk space: 0.5\u00a0GB\r\n</li></ul>\r\nVIDEOS\r\nTEAM TEASER TRAILER\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE TRAILER\r\n\r\nFULL WALKTHROUGH\r\n\n\r\nOTHER MATERIALS\r\n<ul><li>Presskit factsheet</li><li>Full presskit and team bio</li><li>Readme</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T17:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/954/9540e87c77986126d7b6c804e7380e61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Precotonejde", "Drew_McMeek", "Team Trigram", "LankyDev", "Yakotrick"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
