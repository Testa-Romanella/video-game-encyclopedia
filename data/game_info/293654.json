This is called Reunion Day.\r\nLiving in a village close to the Gate to the Underworld, Elena prepares for Reunion Day. Unbeknownst to her, however, mysterious circumstances are forcing a change in plans\u2026\r\n<p><strong>NB!

Therefore this is very much a work in progress, but I hope you\u2019ll enjoy it nonetheless!</p>\n<p>As I did this mostly to try to getter at writing, I\u2019m using RPG Maker MV's in-built tileset, and there\u2019s no music yet as I intend to compose some myself at a later date.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things to implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the rest of the story</li>\n<li>original music</li>\n<li>original sound effects (maybe)</li>\n<li>original art (maybe)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>Kitten, rooster, fox, sheep, ogre face and sprite - Avery\u00a0<br/>(wanted to use her wolf battlers but RPG Maker wouldn\u2019t let me use them!)</p>\n<p>Plugins used:</p>\n<p>Skill Core, Map Gold Window, Region Restrictions, Region Events by Yanfly<br/>Endphase Triggers, Hidden Choice Conditions, Battle Weather by Hime<br/>Simple Event Fade by kuoushi<br/>EIS Shop System by Endless Illusion Software<br/>Fullscreen Toggle Option by SumRndmDde</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df1/df1b985bedaddb84b25438a13d726b4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fredstoyva"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
