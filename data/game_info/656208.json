But\u00a0alas, this butterfly has the curse of chaos theory! Every flap of its wings summons a powerful lightning strike on the opposite end of the world, that can destroy the very things this butterfly wishes to protect. You must keep the meadow thriving as long as possible, as these lightning strikes grow more and more dangerous. And don't let the pressure get to you-- crashing into the trees or touching the ground spells game over.</p>\n<p>Controls: A and D keys to steer, space to flap the butterfly's wings. To pollinate a flower, land on\u00a0its petals, and wait for new flowers go grow around it.</p><p>Credits for assets I used:\u00a0Butterfly (Animated) by Innowell GMBH, Lowpoly Flowers by Chlyang, Free Trees by Ada_King, and Lightning Bolt Effect for Unity by Digital Ruby (Jeff Johnson).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3f/a3f79be7f568e07317a438603a3c6514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["noahbissell@gmail.com"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
