The walls of the caves constantly seem to shift colors,</em><br/><em>with no pattern emerging, while other patches remain static in a single color - some</em><br/><em>slowly shifting shape, others not. The caves are filled with things that have no place</em><br/><em>here - a house, falling apart one end, while nearby is an immaculate outhouse. A</em><br/><em>boat is in one cave, while water is in another. Two tables are placed with chairs, but</em><br/><em>the chairs do not match the tables, and the tables are put together at odd, asymmetrical</em><br/><em>angles. In one cave are fungi, some as large as a tree, and others no bigger</em><br/><em>than the thumb of a human child. And a door, in the middle of a tunnel that leads to</em><br/><em>a cave with empty crates and barrels. Even a well that drags up sand and a bottomless</em><br/><em>chasm with a bridge across it. All are here, all have no place here. And one</em><br/><em>thing that does make sense. A prison cell.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Included in this map pack you'll find the following for use in your games:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One page (Pathfinder 2, though usable for all systems) description of the Caves of Chaos.</li>\n<li>Two maps, one with dots and one with squares that allow you to use the Caves of Chaos both in and out of combat scenarios.
