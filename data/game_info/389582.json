M to mute audio.</p>\n<p>The player has the goal to collect different kinds of artifacts. When enough is collect a new island appears. When the spiral is formed a weird portal appears and a new world will be generated.</p>\n<p>This game is a turn-based explorative game. Each new world is bigger than the one before, the game is endless and you will eventually get bored and quit.</p>\n<p>The content of the island is randomly generated and this game is a bit of a dungeon crawler but linear. The later islands will contain ghost that follows you and when you collide with them you get spawned. Some of the ghosts leave a trail of spikes what can it a bit harder to maneuver.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c03/c03a918a544889107249e50f2a92f50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nannings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
