Particularly, I wanted to explore the idea that when deprived of sight in the darkness, our sense of hearing can become augmented.</p>\r\nGameplay<p>Arrows to move, space to use lamp.</p>\n<p>Hide &amp; Seek relies heavily on stereo sound and <strong><em>headphones are recommended</em></strong>.<br/>In the game you wander about a haunted house with a lamp.<br/>When the lamp is off you can hear a creature stalking you, and you must avoid it.<br/>When the lamp is on the creature will flee from you, but cannot hear it. Furthermore, you have limited light and you must search for jars of oil to refuel the lamp.<br/>You win by exposing the creature to the lamplight.</p>\r\nCredits\r\nArt\r\n<p>Haunted mansion, Hero Tokens 3, and Halloween Monster Tokens by Ross McConnell of 2minutetabletop.com, with modifications, under a CC BY-NC 4.0 License</p>\r\nAudio\r\n<p><strong>CC BY 3.0, with modifications:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u201cBook, Flipping Through Pages, A.wav\u201d and \"Water, Dripping, Medium, A.wav\" by InspectorJ (jshaw.co.uk)</li><li>\u201cWoodenChairWood.wav\u201d by mikaelfernstrom\r\n  </li><li>\u201cMonster Screech.wav\u201d by YuriNikolai\r\n  </li><li>\u201cLlama_SiendoApagada.wav\u201d by Thingy17\r\n  </li><li>\u201cWild Boar / Grunting / Squealing\u201d TheVeoMammoth11\r\n  </li><li>\u201cToilet Flush\u201d by EminYILDIRIM\r\n  </li><li>\u201cPiano Keys .m4a\u201d by Alexhanj</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CC BY-NC 3.0, with modifications:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u201cOlive Oil\u201d by rickaldo09</li><li>\u201cPlant noises.WAV\u201d by tjoppie</li><li>\u201cBasinInputOutput.wav\u201d by acclivity\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:25:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7b91323ce5021d67515caaf5e128b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["grzykiel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
