Why did Michael publish this game? What's with that weird cover image he made for the game? I'll tell you something that will hopefully answer these questions.</p>\n<p>You might have already read it already, but this is the first game I have published in my history of game development (though, this isn't the first game I ever made in general). I can't exactly remember when it was published, as it happened a while ago, but the game's file description seems to have some information on when it has been completed, or even released. The game's description says that the game was\u00a0DN (which I believe stands for \"done\") on\u00a0November the 15th, 2015 at\u00a03:56 PM. I made the game with Microsoft Paint (which explains why a bunch of sprites in the game have a white background) and with a game engine called Construct 2. I published the game on the arcade page of the\u00a0game engine's website: www.scirra.com.</p>\n<p>As time passed, the website announced that the game engine\u00a0will be retired this year, on the 1st of July, meaning that that day will be the end of support of Construct 2. Earlier to that, they have greatly changed their arcade website for their new game engine called Construct 3. As a result of this change, the games I have published on the arcade website have disappeared.</p>\n<p>I thought that this game, MG (Michael Game), was important to my game development history, and since it has been removed from the arcade website I once published it on, I thought of republishing it on itch.io.</p>\n<p>This game will show what my early days of game development were like.
