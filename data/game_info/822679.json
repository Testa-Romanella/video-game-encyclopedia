Pilots control their \u201cMecssiah\u201d in a large arena moving in all directions while shooting lasers and swinging swords to defeat their opponent. The game is stylized after 80s anime and takes influence from Mecha anime, both old (Gigantor) and new (Mobile Suit Gundam).</p>\n<p>Few but unique. Choose from a diverse cast of Pilots and their Mecssiah, each with a unique fighting style and attack options to defeat your opponent in combat.</p>\n<p>Flow in defense and offense. LIAO emphasizes aiming and skilled movement over difficult inputs, learning frame data, or complicated combo strings. Freedom is the focus, with most moves being able to cancel into one another.</p>\n<p>Ease of play. No controller or arcade stick is needed. LIAO is designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard to take advantage of the accuracy it allows over other control options.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am developing this game by myself. My hope is if this demo has enough interest, I will work towards creating a small solid package with online, local, and story modes with eight characters for the cost of around 25 dollars. The focus going forward will be\u00a0 me saving up enough money to get\u00a015 minutes of original music and a few voice lines for each character, as I am a visual artist and have no experience creating music.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T17:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ba/4bace8e28b7c3c116dc2c0fb7c00e771.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ironwood22"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
