In this game, we have focused on how people bought essentials in bulk (although we strongly condemn such behaviors). In the game itself, the player is supposed to stock essentials like toilet papers, sanitizers, and food items. Also, the player is equipped with a unique mask gun which allows him to \"shoot\" other people with masks in order to stop them for a small amount of time from stocking supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - Move<br/>Mouse - Look Around<br/>CTRL - Slide<br/>SPACE - Jump<br/>F - Grab/Use<br/>Left Click - Shoot Masks<br/>TAB - View Inventory</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>The game is made by Supantha Paul(Twitter) and Deepargh Chatterjee(Twitter)</p>\n<p>All the art assets are made by us (except the character models, which were also heavily modified).
