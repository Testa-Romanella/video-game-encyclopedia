All scripts are written from scratch, and almost all models and prefabs were put together by me using blender, gimp and cc0 texturing websites.</p>\n<p>The genre isn't entirely clear to me but I'd go somewhere between puzzle and psychological horror. However nothing is particularly scary or difficult so I'd say it's more experiential than anything else.\r\n</p>\n<p>Builds are x64 for windows and macOS. All you needs is the wasd keys and a mouse to play, although directional audio is a large part of the mechanics.\r\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, ignore the fact I wrote the title card wrong. I'm not pushing a patch just for that although I'm sure you can find many other bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e9529ad32bae15eed80139dcf8ef7f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bobby Greathead"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
