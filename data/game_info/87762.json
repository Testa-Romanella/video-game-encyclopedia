The latest strategy game from Hunted Cow Studios brings the classic Decision Games board game to Mac; and is the first in a series of games to come from this exciting partnership. Take command as either the American colonies or the British Empire and shape the future of a nation, with 10 historical battles. <br/><br/>You will face the same tactical challenges as generals such as George Washington and William Howe, with missions of varying size and objectives, and 24 different combat units. As with previous strategy games from Hunted Cow, every effort has been made to capture the look and feel of the warfare methods, equipment and uniform of the day, and this title is no exception. In these battles players will also find the detailed and accurate maps, orders of battle, and named regiments from the well-loved Decision Games board game. <br/><br/>The hex-based game system features a large variety of infantry, cavalry and artillery units, generals and terrain types.
