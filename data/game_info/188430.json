Rock-paper-scissors is a game we used to play a lot in our childhood to settle deals (e.g. who'll be the leader of the soccer-team) and just for fun. So we decided it'll be a perfect match for throwback theme.</p>\n<p>An idea is simple you choose rock, scissors or paper and your opponent also chooses something. You should show your choice at the same time via hand and then you can see who won:</p>\n<ul><li>rock beats scissors</li><li>scissors bit paper</li><li>paper bits rock</li></ul>\n<p>In our online-game we used cards to denote choices. And we allowed users to play 3 rounds in one go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0c/b0c4728d150d83dc7afad1873e1d4cd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["epaminond", "Sergey Gornostaev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
