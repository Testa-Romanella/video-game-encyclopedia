Try to win the game by finding happiness or fulfillment before life drags you down too much. Balance your happiness, focus, pride, money and more. Keep your friends and relationships happy, and most importantly be proud of yourself! Good luck!<br/><p> <br/></p>\n<p>Are You Alone? is my first solo project to date. \u00a0It's not really something people are likely to enjoy, it's more about telling my story- and the story of a lot of people struggling with the same things, perhaps. Please don't donate, especially not right now. It's not worth any money.</p>\n<p>Game behavior code is entirely mine, though the assets for the Terminal, the sound, and the code handling the terminal (sending messages from the user to the code and vice versa) come from the Udemy course by GameDev.tv: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/learn/v4/overview I used their terminal as a timer saver.</p>\n\n<p>A note about perspective: This game is written from the point of view of a straight man, which is why the game focuses primarily on dating women, as that's my experience. I don't feel like I'm informed enough, nor that it'd be appropriate, to cover other points of view given the somewhat serious nature of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdd/fdd1421fb0ab956b3ed190e033e32315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HowlSoftworks"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
