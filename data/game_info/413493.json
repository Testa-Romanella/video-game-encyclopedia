The spectator lives this through the eyes of director Jan Kounen as he goes on a spiritual voyage in the heart of the Amazon. For almost two decades, Jan has been traveling once a year to the Peruvian region of the Amazon, to meet indigenous healers and expand his knowledge of their traditional medicine. His wish is to share the intimate mystery of this experience with you.<h3>Experience the magic and healing power of ayahuasca</h3>Through the use of Virtual Reality, AYAHUASCA hopes to stay faithful to the original Shipibo tradition of consuming this plant as a transformative and meditative ritual. As such, the psychedelic journey will be guided by an indigenous South American shaman. <br/><br/><h3>Ayahuasca, the vine of the soul, and how to find your inner space.</h3>Each virtual trip is its own experience, as different views and perspectives will reveal new ways of seeing and understanding. <br/>Tap into your inner sense of calm and lose yourself in the kosmik journey.<br/><br/><br/>Motion sensors in the headset will allow the system to keep track of your movement and posture and react accordingly. The visions will either intensify or diminish, depending on movement and angles of viewing.
