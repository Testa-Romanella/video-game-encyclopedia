The design of the game is\u00a0heavily inspired by games like\u00a0<em>Fantasy Zone</em> and\u00a0<em>NiGHTS into Dreams</em>. This was a game I worked on for several months during the summer and early autumn of 2020. I had wanted to put together a complete single stage demo to show as a prototype, but I fell short of that goal.\u00a0This was a project I was very excited to work on, and I am still excited to one day pick up where I left off and achieve something a little more complete.</p>\n<p>If you decide to check this out, please bear in mind that since this is an incomplete prototype\u00a0much of the game's art and audio assets are merely placeholders. The current visual style doesn't represent what the finished game would have looked like.</p>\n<p>To see the controls, check out the included text file named 'Instructions'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df9a285a97ccafd9dc111d1ac9b72ed3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trickytriangles"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
