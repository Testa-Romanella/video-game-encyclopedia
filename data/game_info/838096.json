I hope this short demo interests you anyways.\r\n<p>Solve puzzles in a test facility and reach the exit!<br/>You can move in a grid, and each step is counted.<br/>Get your tiny blob shaped robot companion to help you! His AI was trained on footage of cats, so he's easily distractable...</p>\n<p><em>Well...</em></p>\n<p>The robot, and the many levels relying on it, are missing from this demo. Whoops.<br/><strong>Controls are explained ingame, can be viewed from pause menu (Esc)</strong></p>\n<p>Developed solo by me, in 84 hours for the WOWIE! Jam 4.0.
