It was made to  practice my pixel art and to get another game out the door. I am pretty  happy with how the pixel art had turned out. As for the game itself, I  am pretty pleased with some of the mechanics. I did get bored with it  all towards the end and rushed it a bit so it could be over. A puzzle  game isn't something I'd usually go for but it is what it is. If you do  play I hope it gives you a little enjoyment out of it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c74925df995a873e7d4f1eba54e49ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeHaine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
