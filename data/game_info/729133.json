My plans to add for the next build are the following:</p>\n<p>- Menu screens and working buttons</p>\n<p>- Implementing sandbox and rougelike elements</p>\n<p>- Adding more levels and characters</p>\n<p>- Upgrading the textures</p><p>These are plans for the forseeable future and could change throughout time.
