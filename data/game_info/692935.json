Which means fast speed, rocket jumps, and good / lucky timing!</p><p><strong>How to Play<br/></strong>You play as a blue hoverboard in the floating HoverLeague stadium. At the start of the game your player and ten balls will spawn in the middle of the field. Try your best to knock the balls into each other and hopefully score a goal. Be careful not to accidentally score against yourself. And remember your team is blue and the rival team is red.\u00a0<strong>Have fun and\u00a0I hope you\u00a0enjoy the game!</strong></p><p><strong>Music Used</strong><br/>\r\nA New Chapter (Original Mix) by Josh Dirschka\r\n<br/>\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/josh-dirschka/a-new-chapter-original-mix-free-download\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<strong>Input</strong><strong>Action</strong>WASD / Arrow Keys<br/>Move<br/>Spacebar (Tap or Hold)<br/>Jump /\u00a0Boost Up<br/>Escape or P<br/>Pause Game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T06:03:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe0fdea6417ad22b099eb136fdf23d4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sean Hagstrom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
