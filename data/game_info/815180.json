The main attraction, of course, is the new generation of sex dolls. These are animatronic robots programmed to do whatever you want! However, at night, the behavior of the robots became somewhat unpredictable, and finding you as a security guard turned out to be much cheaper than finding a repairman.<br />\nFrom your office, you should keep a close eye on the security cameras. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you can use overnight. This means that when you run out of energy, no more security doors and cameras! As soon as one of the dolls left his post, your task will be to find them and, as a last resort, close the doors.<br />\nFreatures:<br />\n<em>Tense gameplay. At your disposal are only cameras and doors. All this requires energy, which must be saved;<br />\n</em>Three dolls, each with their own AI. Someone needs to be watched more often, and someone often moves;<br />\n<em>After passing 5 nights, the custom night will become available to you. In it you can customize the game as you want;<br />\n</em>A large number of jumpscares;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T10:33:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c67/c67e310984bfbd7bd84b11b173f32fed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slippy Floor"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Slippy Floor"], "esrb_rating": null}
