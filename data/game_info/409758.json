It tried to recreate a sci-fi enviroment from scratch in a 3 months period without never do it before. Just with basic knowledge of modleing I started this\u00a0 with the idea of improving my knowledge of texturing, materials, lighting and Unity overall.\u00a0   It's not a polished work and the player only jumps and walk, but I thought it deserved to be here. All the assets and the project overall is totally made by me, from 3D modelling, materials, etc. I only used a Unity library for postprocessing effects and free SFX. Only avariable for Windows.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Move - AWSD</p>\n<p>Camera - Mouse</p>\n<p>Jump - Spacebar<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53ed198aa3be58d171fc20b4c928f014.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fiuras"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
