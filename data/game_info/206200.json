My game is about the boring job\u00a0I had over the summer where I had to count paper and package it. The reason I based my game on that is because it required a lot of repetition and multitasking, which I thought translated well into a game environment.</p>\n<p>2. I suppose the fun part was getting it to work and add all of the little things like how the paper flies over the edge of the table when you count. Overall, the actually programming itself was alright. Something difficult was tweaking it to a point where all of the values made sense with each other. How much paper can a person reasonably count in the time limit and how can I make this winnable?</p>\n<p>-Abigail Austin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc9b5f2a4216722a98e36f0323554eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AbbyA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
