This is the Mayor of this town. We need your help. This whole district has become impoverished and polluted. People are dying from pollution. Luckily migrants keep pouring in because the land price is just \u20ac50. You can do a census for \u20ac5 per house. If you match a couple they will move together and double their net worth. That way you can get rid of the shanties and increase our tax collection. Your goal is to buy up at least half of the land and turn it into parks. Less houses for more parks. Pick up the trash to recycle it and get an \u20ac. All interactions are done by clicking with your mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35a/35a4377623693f0f30da79c98f95ff1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Makiuso"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
