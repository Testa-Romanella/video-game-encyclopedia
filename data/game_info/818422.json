Luckily for him, he has his magic dice and disembodied hands!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guards will approach your cell and try to take your dice away. You can pick them up and toss them away, or you can pick up the dice and roll them over with it.\u00a0 Whenever the dice stop rolling, a spell is casted! <strong>The RED DICE determines which spell is casted</strong>, while the <strong>BLUE DICE is how powerful the spell is</strong> - so try to keep it at a six for as long as possible!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Roll either of the dice to cast the spell! Both dice work individually of each other, so you can cast two spells at once by rolling both of them. Most spells will end early if you pick up a dice to roll it again, so rolling over and over again might not be the best strategy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button to Interact (drag and throw dice)</li><li>F2 to FORCE RESTART</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Stepford (Programmer) :\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Newgrounds\u00a0|\u00a0Itch.io</li><li>Wooly (Artist) :\u00a0Twitter<br/>\n</li><li>Milkworm (Artist/Musician) :\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Newgrounds\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud<br/>\n</li><li>Duster (Musician) :\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Newgrounds\u00a0|\u00a0Soundcloud</li></ul>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:14:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/360/3606e905b3ab5f52d9658560f6c528f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Stepford"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
