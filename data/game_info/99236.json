Select from eight different battleships and take on hoardes of enemies in four different gameplay modes, each with their own twists, trophies and online highscore tables! Mastering Rydunis is a rewarding experience in more than one way!</p>\n<p>Sequel to the critically acclaimed YYG Sandbox games Radunis, Radunis Arc, and Radunis 3D!</p>\n<p>Boasting aside, this game has tons of additive blending effects, hundreds of on-screen enemy objects at a time, and four gameplay modes.</p>\n<ul><li>Classic arcade mode sends a constant stream of enemies towards you, occasionally throwing in a wave or two that surrounds you - think fast or expire!</li><li>Fusion mode throws bigger fused enemies at you, that breaks into smaller versions when shot, akin to Asteroids. How big can they get? Only one way to find out!</li><li>Ambush mode constantly surrounds you with waves of enemies, forcing you to think on the fly but rewarding you with a huge chance to rack up combos!</li><li>Roguelike Mode is basically the three other modes... at the same time. Have fun with that~</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7e0af1a13219ba3f744f88debbeeb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
