I\u00a0wanted to see what it took to push a game through to completion. (Short answer: A lot of time and work.)</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by classic arcade shoot-'em-ups. It's not bullet hell, rather it's one-hit-and-die with game play and difficulty balanced accordingly.\u00a0If you get a feel for the different enemy firing patterns, and how to take advantage of the slow turning speed of enemy turrets then you can last pretty well even on hard mode.</p>\n<p>I had plans for a story line involving a mad scientist feeding technology from the future back through a time portal, hence the game would evolve from classic WWII weapons and vehicles into something more sci fi. But I couldn't draw a decent cut-scene to save my life, and the futuristic technology ideas didn't get far past \"umm.. here's some lazers\".</p>\n<p>Still I think it's fun, I\u00a0put a fair bit of work into getting a game play balance that I\u00a0liked, and I'm particularly happy with how level 5 turned out. So if you're a fan of retro shmup with a distinct indy flavour you might enjoy it.</p>\n<p>5 levels, 5 end bosses (or 7 depending on how you count them), 3 mid level bosses, 30+ minutes of game play to complete.</p>\n<p>Also if you have a WebAssembly enabled browser you can\u00a0play it on line in your browser</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e62f2b3b59c24ab9b484891a56c32c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Mulgrew"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
