The choice is yours to be made. I pride myself on my ability to create a game with consistent power scaling and no plot holes.</p>\n<p>This game is also packed with plenty of references to other games,anime, meme culture etcetera to the point where it's only 50% original content. There's also a few lot of hidden content so be sure to interact with everything, every square might prove to be useful.</p>\n<p>The actual final boss is pretty much unbeatable so if someone do manage to beat them without stat manipulation and 100% the game, I commend you heavily,\u00a0 you're probably the best turn based RPG player alive and deserve something special! To put it in perspective, I saw the game over screen 3 times when debugging the final boss, and that's with all the broken items and stat manipulations in the world.</p>\n<p>The game up until the final battle is actually pretty short, around a few hours of gameplay if you managed to grind efficiently and beat everything first try, but if you can actually do that, I fucked up, hard.</p>\n<p>There will be minimal images posted on this page to reduce spoilers as games are best played blind, the blinder the better so I'll just write a list of features that this game contains. If you do not care about spoilers, then feel free to watch the trailer and read the full analysis in the comments.</p>\n<p>\"Features\"</p>\n<p>- Fast Pace &amp; Unfair Battles</p>\n<p>- Limited Saving Opportunities</p>\n<p>- Greedy Shopkeepers</p>\n<p>- Combo System</p>\n<p>- Die over and over and over!</p>\n<p>\"People Who Helped This Game Directly\" <br/>- Asgarolt(Artist)</p>\n<p>- TaoOat(RPG Maker VX Ace Steam Key Giver)</p>\n<p>\"Discord Server\" <br/>https://discord.gg/AuyjkgN6vJ</p>\n<p>Note: Alternate reality combatants' power levels may not be accurate to their canon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T05:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ea/2ea057935ba57746dcc7d5a7e9f758c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xolze Telos"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
