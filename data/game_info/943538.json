And they usually turn on TV in the night because the electric charge for TV is free.  They think TV can be used for a lamp in the dark. The point is that they are too poor to pay for the electric charge of a lamp.<br/><br/>For good or for evil, Cherubino was selected by Brahmana for his plan. <br/><br/>Why did Brahmana select Cherubino? <br/><br/>The answer is going to become clear in the ending.<br/><br/><h3>Brahmana</h3>A key character in the game. <br/> <br/>Brahmana talks to Cherubino through spiritual world but Cherubino doesn't see Brahmana with his eyes like a spiritual entity. <br/><br/>He is trying to do something good or bad by using Cherubino as one of his tools. <br/><br/><br/><br/>But his hidden attempt will not be in the light until the ending.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T02:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5e3cc56f73b1363d7175e1dbd462c59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brahmana \"Perfect\""], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Brahmana \"Perfect\""], "esrb_rating": null}
