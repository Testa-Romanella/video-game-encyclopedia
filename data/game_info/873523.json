It is a silly little game where you control a paddle using the mouse and try to keep up with a ball that, over time, get smaller and faster.</p>\n<p>Your target is to get the highest score possible.</p>\n<p>The game is still under development. This release is just a beta version that only includes the core game loop. It is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Mobile versions of the game are planned once the game development is complete.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is developed from scratch, using no game engines, relying only on the SDL library.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T08:19:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef2f069e55fef3be4463d0e0d2ef3a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pink Shades Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
