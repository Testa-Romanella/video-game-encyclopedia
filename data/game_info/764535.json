Most of the game happens underground, and it can take players hours to realize that while they have been growing trees on the surface, something sinister is happening in the roots.<br/><br/>While the Rot has already crept in and disabled the Helping Hand Plus Ultra and Nidhogg's Hand, the game still mostly functions. If I ever find an old build from when it went on Steam I\u00a0can fix even that.<br/><br/>LOHAE leads to LOMAT which leads to ZampanioSim.\u00a0 The End is Never The End.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T07:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d07/d072a321ff415ab0f8f2c7013a79c113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jadedResearcher"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
