Each death increases the difficulty of the game, but also increases the speed at which the bar fills.  The bar only fills while you are running on the ground (meaning your ghosts are running on the treadmills).  You only have 12 lives and they run out fast!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: </p>\n<p>A + D to move </p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>In this game you must balance your need for money and your ability to dodge.\u00a0 Get hit by a projectile to move onto the next stage; your ghost will be placed onto the treadmill and a next rabbit will be born in a more difficult environment.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>See how far you can push it and stay alive making the most money!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c3/0c309a707809a2322a227bc0abcd1f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RainFrogs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
