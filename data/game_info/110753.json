I've learned a lot in the months since making it, and I will be remaking it after I am finished with \"deeper\".

If you've played \"spooky house\" &amp; \"return to spooky house\", some aspects will be familiar, but it is different in a lot more ways (and you don't need to have played those two games to appreciate this one!).</p>\n<p>It is intended to be played in one sitting (estimated 30 min - 1 hr).</p>\n\n<p>When I made and titled this game, I did not know of the other game titled Virginia that came out at around the same time. When I remaster/remake this game next year, I will be changing the title to avoid even the tiniest bit of confusion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a002d31913bc9ebc80344f2e12568a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DangerZone Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
