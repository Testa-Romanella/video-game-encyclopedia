I used the Twine Interactive Fiction Engine to experiment and learn. I started off with simple tests, which eventually evolved into large games: A train game,  where you were stuck on a train and you could shovel coal and drink tea and look out the window at the random scenery selected for that day. It was quite zen. I also created a game based on Edgar Alan Poe's, \"The Raven.\" It was an educational game that sought to take a really long poem and dissect it with comics, gifs, and mini-games. People liked it, and I had a fun time dressing up ravens in various costumes for it.<br/><br/>Those games were more art than game according to the community. That was a fair opinion, the mechanics were as limited as my knowledge. I wasn't satisfied to just create art though. I wanted to make a game that was unmistakably a game. I set a goal, I was going to make a 100+ level game with maps and mechanics and puzzles. I wasn't going to take a whole decade either, I made an effort to work on it every day, even if I was tired so that I could someday finish it. <br/><br/>At first I didn't even know how to make a map. Then I discovered arrays and how to use them. It was magical seeing my character walk around on the map I put together. I spent all day at work coming up with theories as to how I could implement the various features I wanted to put in the game. Errors. Errors. Constant errors. I'd spend all day just trying to get one thing to work. My determination paid off and the mechanics I kept hammering at started to work. Usually at that point they were clunky and flawed. I'd end up completely re-doing them, but I didn't mind, every error was a chance to learn better techniques. <br/><br/>I hope that the love put into the game makes it all the more enjoyable to play.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e0/0e0d3a79fc58d5ec5359b9f2500fdc15.jpg", "website": "https://gamejolt.com/@spess", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Midnight Warden"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Superfantastic Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
