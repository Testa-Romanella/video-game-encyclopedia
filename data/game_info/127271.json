You need a mouse and a keyboard. Each player has their own key on the keyboard (A, D, G, J) and can drop croquettes into a pan by clicking them. Croquettes are getting fried and become darker over time. When they are finished, they explode (obviously), pushing other croquettes over the edge and out of the pan. After one minute, the time is over and the player with the best thrown-in-to-exploded-croquettes-ratio (skill) wins the round. You can restart by clicking the button in the top of the screen.<br/>Did I mention the furiously shaking pan?</p><p>Both the pan and croquette models were created in Blender by me.</p><p>The sounds have been used under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license and originally belong to:<br/>Frying Food Sound by J Bravo (http://soundbible.com/2031-Frying-Food.html)<br/>Rooster Crowing 2 Sound by Shelley (http://soundbible.com/2040-Rooster-Crowing-2.html)<br/>Blop by Mark DiAngelo (http://soundbible.com/2067-Blop.html)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/643b294fb5e892922d56670cbb31cee1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jasper Meiners"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
