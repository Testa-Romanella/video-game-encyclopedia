Humans have found a way to coexist with machines and work towards a brighter future for humanity. No longer are skies darkened by grey clouds of smog, or oceans drowning in plastic. Humans learned to harvest nature\u2019s gifts effectively and sustainably and now live in abundance and equability.\r\nMany years from the present, The Farm, managed by Valria\u2019s family, buzzes with activities all performed by droids and their human companions. Some harvest the goods, some herd the cattle, and others carry produce on their arms and backs to transport them to where they need to be next.\r\n\r\nThe Farm\u2019s success is partly due to M1-N3R-VA\u2019s excellent management, the artificially intelligent computer system behind every droid operating in The Farm. Her fail-proof software has never caused any damage before, and her logistical calculations never failed to succeed.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEverything seemed fine, until one day M1-N3R-VA\u2019s software became infected with a seemingly unstoppable virus. At first, the virus only caused small inconveniences in The Farm\u2019s droids: weirdly performed tasks, small crashes between droids, and instructions not being followed perfectly like before.\u00a0\r\nNow it is up to Valria and her loyal companion, D-T9 to stop the virus from spreading any closer to the city and to stop the corrupted droids sent by M1-N3R-VA to eliminate them as well. Can they reach the computer\u2019s core in time to save humanity from a war against machines?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game was created by a team of Mexican developers as an entry for the Vim Jam 3\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n-Programing &amp; Lead designer-\r\nMecha Brain\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Pixel art-\r\nAnthonyRose(@ROSEHTRA)\r\nMecha Brain\r\n\r\n-Writing &amp; Level design-\r\nUnafuentesita\r\n- Music &amp; SFX-\r\nFer Pega\r\n\r\n-Fonts-\r\nDigital disco by jeti\r\nupheveal by AEnigma", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T18:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a88899f8400476530904fc264b864054.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["AnthonyRose/ROSEHTRA", "Mecha Brain", "fersita", "Fer Pega"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
