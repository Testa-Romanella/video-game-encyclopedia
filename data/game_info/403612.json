Cosby began his career as a stand-up comic at the\u00a0hungry i\u00a0in\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0during the 1960s. He then landed a starring role in the television show\u00a0<em>I Spy</em>, followed by his own sitcom\u00a0<em>The Bill Cosby Show</em>, which ran for two seasons from 1969 to 1971. In 1972, using the\u00a0Fat Albert\u00a0character developed during his stand-up routines, Cosby created, produced, and hosted the animated comedy television series\u00a0<em>Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids</em>\u00a0which ran until 1985, centering on a group of young friends growing up in an urban area. Throughout the 1970s, Cosby starred in about half a dozen films, and occasionally returned to film later in his career. In 1976, he earned his\u00a0Doctor of Education\u00a0from the\u00a0University of Massachusetts Amherst. His dissertation discussed the use of\u00a0<em>Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids</em>\u00a0as a teaching tool in elementary schools.</p>\n<p>Beginning in the 1980s, Cosby produced and starred in the television sitcom\u00a0<em>The Cosby Show</em>, which aired from 1984 to 1992 and was rated as the number one show in America for 1985 through 1989. The sitcom highlighted the experiences and growth of an affluent\u00a0African-American\u00a0family. Cosby produced the spin-off sitcom\u00a0<em>A Different World</em>, which aired from 1987 to 1993. He also starred in\u00a0<em>The Cosby Mysteries</em>\u00a0from 1994 to 1995 and in the sitcom\u00a0<em>Cosby</em>\u00a0from 1996 to 2000, and hosted\u00a0<em>Kids Say the Darndest Things</em>\u00a0from 1998 to 2000.</p>\n<p>Cosby's reputation was tarnished during the mid-2010s when numerous women made\u00a0sexual assault accusations\u00a0against him, the earliest dating back decades. More than 60 women have accused him of either attempted sexual assault,\u00a0rape,\u00a0drug-facilitated sexual assault,\u00a0sexual battery,\u00a0child sexual abuse, or\u00a0sexual misconduct, all of which he has denied, and the\u00a0statute of limitations\u00a0had by the mid-2010s expired in nearly all cases. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of\u00a0aggravated indecent assault\u00a0and sentenced to three to ten years in prison in September 2018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897870468953dae3de177c3dc26831d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Golzay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
