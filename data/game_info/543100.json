To help achieve the aesthetic from the original, there is a tight limit on the amount of memory the complete game can use: all code and data is located below $1000 (4K) in the c64 memory....</p>\n<p><strong>AIM OF THE GAME:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\nYou are the pilot of a b52 bomber. Your mission is to bomb 9 special ships in your area. The only problem is... It's very cloudy, so you can't see anything! All you can do is take a\u00a0guess and hope for the best - that you are in luck to hit all 9 ships in a 20x20 grid map. You have 99 bombs as spares and 9 bombs in the magazine!\u00a0 If you fail this mission, you are not allowed to try again! Cause that would be the end of you! Good luck and God speed Captain CloudBerry! PS! The controls in the plane are a little hard to steer! Dismiss!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS - HOW TO KILL THE HIDDEN SHIPS:</strong></p>\n<p>Use any joystick port - Control the target\u00a0sprite over the target area and hit the fire button when you are done\u00a0\u00a0to queue\u00a0fire salvos, you need to aim all 9 bombs before it starts. Another 9 bombs will be added to your magazine, until you are out of ammo or have beaten all 9 ships around the map.\u00a0 If you go out of ammo, game over man!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:\r\n</strong><br/><br/>Programmed by Docster\u00a0 (C) Megastyle and Phoenixware 2021</p>\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>\n<p>The game will be made available for downloading March 31st 2021, and is in other words\u00a0not available for download before that date.
