The simulation has a few things worth looking out for:</p>\n<ul><li>Multiple different ship AI modes.</li><li>A few different weapons. Some (e.g. lasers)\u00a0have different effective ranges. Some (e.g. rockets) will bypass shields.</li><li>Larger ships have turrets on them.</li><li>Smaller ships have higher evasion ratings and are harder to hit with slower weapons.</li><li>Equipment on ships is individually simulated. Equipment can take damage and be disabled. For instance, ships may have their weapons disabled (so they can't shoot anymore), or they may have their engines disabled (so they start going slower and are easier to hit).</li><li>For now it just spawns a few different random waves of ships.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>+/-:</strong>\u00a0change speed</li><li><strong>space:</strong> pause</li></ul>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>It's fully <strong>open source</strong>!
