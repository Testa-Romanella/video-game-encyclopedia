I want to be that guy.\"<br/><br/>Naoki Fuse, the self-proclaimed best friend, is always ready to tease Tohru about his situation with the two Sakuras.<br/><br/>But, unbeknownst to him, he is one side of yet another light-hearted love triangle.<br/><br/>Akira Nitta has been Naoki's friend since before they could read and write, and is now finally living under the same (dorm) roof as him.<br/><br/>Kurumi Tachibana used to be Naoki's MMO raiding partner, but they were separated before she ever got a chance to meet him in real life or tell him how she felt.<br/><br/>\"I understand him better than anyone else.\"<br/><br/>Akira and Kurumi have Naoki stumped for the first time in his life. And so, Tohru finally gets a chance to see things from the other side.<br/><br/>The curtains rise on this desolate showdown for love.<strong>Characters</strong>Nanako Sakura<br/>The kind dorm mother of the Tsukimi Athletics Dorm who wakes the students up every morning. She cheerfully makes breakfast every morning just for Tohru Inaba, but not out of special consideration for him. Rather, it\u2019s because the other two residents, Naoki and Akira, usually skip breakfast. Coincidentally, one of her concerns is that those two have been skipping their practices as well.<br/><br/>She acts as a parent to Tohru, supporting, encouraging, and scolding him as he works to become an official member of the Fine Arts Club. At school, Nanako transforms into a strict and imposing homeroom teacher, with a firm line drawn between the two roles.<br/><br/>However, since witnessing Tohru being fussed over by Sakura, the vice president of the Fine Arts Club, her mood at the dorm has been noticeably worse.<br/><br/>Nanako specializes in general housework, honed from her time living alone, and cooking simmered dishes such as nikujaga, curry, and hot pot. Her hobby is gardening, and she devotes her spare time to protecting her garden by weeding the dorm's backyard. She goes on walks in the middle of the night to count the stars whenever she is upset, something she has been doing ever since she was a little girl. Because of her youthful appearance, she is often treated like a child, unbecoming of her status as a teacher. Lately, she has been spending more and more time looking up at the sky from the dorm's backyard.Sakura Kirishima<br/>The class representative and cool beauty in the next seat over. When the other Fine Arts Club members protested Tohru's entry into the club, all it took was for Sakura to say, \u201cI will take responsibility,\u201d to convert them into unanimously approving.<br/><br/>At Rintoku Academy, which is already renowned for its art programs, the Fine Arts Club stands above the rest. And Sakura is the only person capable of wrangling the prideful members of the Fine Arts Club into working, to the point that three club advisors have lost confidence and quit in the past year. Despite only being the vice president of the club, her words\u2019 influence rivals that of the teachers', and she is not taken lightly by anyone.<br/><br/>That is the reason why, when Tohru naturally lines his up desk with Sakura\u2019s to share textbooks or when he invites her to eat lunch together, their classmates get restless. However, as Sakura is the only person who can get the problem children of the Tsukimi dorm to fall into line, she is also the only one capable of being their class representative. Her natural leadership dwarfs Nanako\u2019s, who is still a novice teacher, causing the latter to often feel discouraged.<br/><br/>Sakura dislikes people who are spineless, waste words, or can't keep promises, those of whom greatly outnumber the people she likes. Despite Tohru being all of these, she becomes his guardian when it comes to club activities, looking out for him. But what her clubmates understand least of all is why she gets so fired up when it comes to the Tsukimi dorm mother, Nanako. The two often collide in a rivalry over teaching Tohru about the academy's customs.Akira Nitta<br/>The real-life childhood friend who finds the idea of an Internet childhood friend ridiculous. Akira dreamed about marrying Naoki when she was a little girl, earnestly devoting herself to him and spoiling him... and then doing a complete 180 when she realized he had turned into a sloth because of her. Her current number one wish is to erase those years of puppy-love devotion from her memory.<br/><br/>Just as Naoki managed to enroll in Rintoku through the kendo program, Akira enrolled through its gymnastics program and thus also lives in Tsukimi dorm. For reasons unknown, she no longer attends practice and instead skips to play baseball and table tennis with Naoki. Whenever he asks her why she keeps skipping with him, she simply replies, \"Why don\u2019t you ask the leotard?\"<br/><br/>To Akira, Kurumi doesn't even register as a rival. However, when Kurumi drags Naoki into conversations about Internet games and dating sims, she becomes determined to steer him away, beginning another hopeless battle for his affection.<br/><br/>Akira follows a strict day-to-day diet and is afraid of body weight scales. She often says, \"I wish my stomach would stay closer to my back.\" She is also obsessed with household appliances and has spent the last six months steadily saving to buy a cute refrigerator. Her favorite food is popsicles and her dream is to have a refrigerator stocked year-round with perfect rows of sparkling popsicles.Kurumi Tachibana<br/>The Internet childhood friend who refuses to lose to a real-life childhood friend. Six years ago, HALLO made huge waves among hardcore gamers as one of the first big MMORPGs. Kurumi and Naoki met there and formed a party, shedding blood, sweat, and tears together for more than two years. However, right before they could clear the final dungeon, the game ceased operations and the two were suddenly forced apart. Kurumi had planned to confess to him and ask for his contact information once they cleared it, but it seemed her first love was not to be.<br/><br/>All she knew was that Naoki lived in the same region as her. Kurumi was a shut-in at the time, but she took that day as an opportunity to change. She learned how to be fashionable, took up more club activities, started studying, and became an outgoing person. She had no intention of letting her first love end the way it did.<br/><br/>Two years Naoki's junior, Kurumi was recognized as a genius for the sensitivity portrayed in her art and rose to the top of the Rintoku Academy affiliate school she attended, allowing her to take part in the Rintoku Academy Fine Arts Club\u2019s activities. Through Tohru, she recognized Naoki as the person she had been looking for and, consequently, has started picking fights with Naoki's real-life childhood friend, Akira. However, she gets nervous and loses her ability to speak in front of Naoki, resorting to extremely formal language. When she played HALLO with him, she lacked the courage to confess outright and instead kept wandering around the entrance to the final dungeon.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25e/25e35546667b87fdbb2859deb5e74b84.jpg", "website": "http://solpress.co/projects/sakurasakura/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 445, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiqosoft"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sol Press"], "esrb_rating": null}
