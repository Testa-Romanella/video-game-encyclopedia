Will add more capabilities at a later date.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my\u00a0final year of university capstone project, which gave us 3 months to create a game. I made an RPG. The Bone Witch is set in the fictional town of Solaris, after a Goddess has decreed she is going to destroy the whole island. The other cities believe if Solaris is wiped out, the Goddess will spare them, and so the town is under siege. The Duke believes you should keep fighting. The Priestess believes you should let the invaders in and sacrifice yourselves for the Goddess's forgiveness.</p>\n<p>You can play as one of four characters, and you can do quests, follow the main story, fight in the arena, and use your magic. It's still a work in progress.</p>\n<p>The game is unfinished, with some bugs still, but it works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets by Synty Studios. Code by me.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6f/b6f844d044fb77cc598b98f3a3c1b0c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsbrookey0"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
