There's not much to the gameplay, since the project was more about honing skills related to game development rather than making an entertaining game, but we are still proud of it nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>The objective is to find every beacon in the system. The radar in the center of the screen and the sounds they make will guide you to them.\u00a0Once you find them all, a new star system is randomly generated. Here are the controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Space/Shift/C - Move ship.</li><li>Mouse - Rotate ship.</li><li>Q/E - Roll ship.</li><li>Left Click - Collect beacon (when nearby).<br/>\n</li><li>Ctrl - Hold down to boost and\u00a0travel much faster.</li><li>Z - Enable/disable dampeners. This will automatically slow the ship to a stop relative to nearby objects. When disabled, you can put the ship into orbit or land on planets.</li><li>Tab - Press when looking at any object to scan it. This will show you the object's orbit.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T12:58:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f376605bda78ebb0077b7da8e5dba51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamac", "Noah Litwiller", "Winzlo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
