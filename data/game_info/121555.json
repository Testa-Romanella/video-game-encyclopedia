{"id": 121555, "slug": "snake-maze", "name": "Snake Maze", "name_original": "Snake Maze", "description": "<p>Snake Maze is a puzzle game inspired by the classic Snake game.</p>\n<p>This game is about solving puzzles while having a snake body following you around. The body is a strength, as it allows you to keep buttons pressed after you have moved away from them, as well as a weakness as it acts as a wall that you can get stuck into.</p>\n<p>Later on, there will be wormholes that allow you to split your snake and have it press buttons in multiple parts of the level simultaneously.</p>\n<p>There are no enemies or violence in this game, but you can still lose by getting stuck between walls and your body.</p>\n<p>You can download the main game for free to play the first 10 levels. Then if you want more, you can purchase the Additional Level Pack that contains 10 more levels, including the hardest and most experimental levels in the game as well as a new soundtrack and tileset (you can see that in the last screenshot).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f8471d99987463bc56bd4bf5a6d80bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZilverPhoenix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
