Playable in CMD.<strong> </strong>Source code included<strong>, </strong>so you can easily see and tell me about all errors I made.</p>\n<p>Originally made in Polish, now translated every text to English. <em>Except</em> the logo, I'm too lazy for that.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>//How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Your goal is to reach 'X' point on the map.</p>\n<p>You can only move in first person mode.</p>\n<p>You can check your map to see where you are located, but how many times you can see it depends on chosen difficulty:<br/>1. Easy - Unlimited map openings<br/>2. Normal - 5 map openings<br/>3. Hard - One map opening</p>\n<p><strong>//Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD and Enter to choose difficulty level.<br/>Press Esc if you want to quit or restart the game.<br/>Use AD to rotate and WS to move forward and backward.<br/>Rest is explained in the game.</p>\n<p><strong>//Custom maps:</strong></p>\n<p>1. If you want to create your own map, just edit or make new .txt file named 'mapa1', 'mapa2' or 'mapa3'.</p>\n<p>2. One map should have size of 32x16.<br/></p>\n<p>3. Use symbols shown below to put objects on map, like walls and spawn point.</p>\r\n\r\n Legend:\r\n+ - Walls\r\n? - Free space (that's how the game is coded, fill free space with question marks)\r\n^ - Spawn point\r\nX - Exit\r\n= - Map boundaries (just make an outline with equation marks)\r\n<p>4. Keep the whole map in ONE LINE, because I was too lazy to program it the other way.</p>\n<p>5. Save it in the same folder as app file or overwrite an old one and you're ready to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58e/58e99faa332f1796f7be696b97f8d37e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emki"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
