Choose what to bring on the flight with limited bag space, keeping in mind the items you will need to make the experience comfortable as possible. Keep track of meters representing fatigue, bathroom, thirst, and anxiety. Neglecting any one of those fundamental needs will result in a bad ending for the flight. Utilize all of the items in the bag and every interaction available to the player in the cabin to survive. We wish you a pleasant journey.</p>\n<p>Jumo Yang : Game Designer, Game Art<br/>Nikki Woo : Game Designer, Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T06:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a962cce74ffd97e2f489dc19ff16428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jumo Yang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
