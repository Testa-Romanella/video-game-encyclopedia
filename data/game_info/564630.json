You control an entity that can shoot at enemies and drain the lifeforce of their allies. The interpretation of the theme is that the player needs the allies' essence to become stronger. Without it it will be hard to defeat the enemies.</p>\n<p>In the future I might update this game with new features and other content. For now this game was build with the sole purpose of testing my skills as a solo developer\u00a0during the Brackey's Game Jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move:\u00a0</strong>WASD\u00a0</li><li><strong>Attack:\u00a0</strong>Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Dash:\u00a0</strong>Left Shift</li><li><strong>Drain:\u00a0</strong>E</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Follow me on social media</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Instagram:\u00a0</strong>https://www.instagram.com/tjindevelopment/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Sound effects and background music</p>\n<ul><li>https://www.zapsplat.com/</li><li>https://freesound.org/browse/</li></ul>\n<p>Sprites</p>\n<ul><li>https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-sprites/tag-top-down</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48af43442bf44f75d26daf942d7afca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xCrazyMonkey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
