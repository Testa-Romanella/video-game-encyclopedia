Your phone was in a waterproof container, so you\u00a0try to call for help, but have no cell connection. Fortunately, you should be able to get connection on top of the lighthouse -- if you can get there...</p>\n<p>This game was originally\u00a0made for Lost Relic Jam for the theme Connection. However, I missed the deadline by two minutes and after looking back through decided it really had not been ready anyway.\u00a0 Then I found\u00a0Improve My Game Jam and\u00a0felt it was the perfect opportunity to\u00a0fix it up and am satisfied with the results. More info can be found in the game's jam devlog.\u00a0</p><p>(If you get stuck, I am adding a walkthrough in the comments.)</p>\n\n<p>Credits below.
