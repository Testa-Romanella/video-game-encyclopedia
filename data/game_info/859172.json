You thought at least there would be some time to enjoy the eternal slumber, but there ain\u2019t no rest for the wicked! Waking up in a graveyard, now in the form of a ghost, you don\u2019t remember anything about your past life. But one thing is for sure: you need to leave and go back to the comfort of your house as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Graveyard</em> is a 2D platformer game, in which the player will control a ghost through the W, A, S and D keys to move and spacebar to jump. The goal is to reach the key on the first level and get to the exit gates of the graveyard after that. But it\u2019s not as easy as it looks, for shadow hands will be trying to pull the player back to the beginning!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>All the assets used are from itch.io and Unity's asset library.
