A dog has accidentally stepped through a portal to another world, and he needs to reactive the portal to return home. To reactivate the portal, players must activate runes in a specific order while avoiding enemies and traps.\r\n</p><p>Some things that are included:</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 Players must complete the puzzle of activating runes in a specific order (rainbow order). A checkpoint type system is set up so that if the player activates the wrong rune, they will be transported back to the last correct rune that they activated.</p><p>2. A pickup item to activate the dog's double jump.</p><p>3. When an enemy hits the player, the enemy will bounce and change the direction it's walking in. When the player hits the enemy, the player will bounce off of the enemy's head.</p><p>4. If the player falls into a trap or is killed by an enemy, they will\u00a0be transported back to the last correct rune that they activated.<br/></p><p>5. Shakeable tiles that will shake and then drop\u00a0once the player collides with them.</p><p>6. A dialogue system and an NPC. The dialogue box will only appear when the player is near the NPC or when an event is triggered (i.e. collecting an item). The player is frozen in place when talking to the NPC, as it would be rude to walk away mid-conversation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66ad596f6918cb656c1d249e6c353930.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Angela Majestic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
