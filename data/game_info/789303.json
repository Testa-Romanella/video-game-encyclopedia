One day his village was attacked by \" Shuten D\u014dji \" and killed off his entire clan. Hanzo was filled with anger and wanted revenge on \" Shuten D\u014dji \" who attacked his village. While looking for \" Shuten D\u014dji \", he met another ninja who was out on a scouting mission. The scouting ninja heard the events that took place in Hanzo's village. Seeing the anger embedded within him and his need for revenge, he decided to take him back to his own village to train him.
