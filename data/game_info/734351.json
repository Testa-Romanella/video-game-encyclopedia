Thankfully you have your trusty peashooter at the ready. Take the cheeky good for nothings out! Also you have to shoot red robbers whilst in red mode and blue robbers in blue more, because: reasons!</p>\n<p>Game was developed using the Aimtrak Pro lightgun but it is also relatively fun with a mouse. When using a lightgun try putting your keyboard on the ground and tapping space to swap colour mode. On mouse use right click.</p><p><strong>Known Bugs</strong> (hey, it's a gamejam game):\u00a0</p><ul><li>Please rename the executable to \"My project\" (stupid decision by me before uploading)</li><li>The UI will load a second time when you restart the game. I will hopefully fix this at some point!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/> @timbhison (programming) <br/>@2dforever (art) <br/>@lewisthompsound (audio)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5df09d1224e18687926ee0bc30ddbab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoBallGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
