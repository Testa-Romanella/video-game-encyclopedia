To cancel sideways inertia push DOWN. Or wait for it to cancel itself. <br/></p>\n<p>Make sure to enter the number 1 (ONE) at the start for engine sounds. All sounds are on by default, except engine revving, which is off, but if you push 1 you should get some engine sounds when increasing/decreasing your throttle.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s taken me about a week in a my spare time, with a 6 month gap in the middle due to loss of interest. But I started it again last week and added one of the Clown gang. It\u2019s little more than a tech demo, and I stole the music track from the Amiga game, but it kinda shows what I\u2019d want it to be if I ever finished it. I want to add another Clown biker or two, and give each distinctive AI. The current one is stupid, and while he will try to evade your line of fire he doesn\u2019t see the barricades and doesn\u2019t actively attack you. If I can I\u2019d also intend to add one of those flying vehicles from the film, since they wouldn\u2019t be affected by the road speed.</p>\n<p>The basic premise is: survive the XX kilometres to the stadium, in a Spyhunter style game, and then switch to a Space Invaders type game for the boss fight against Tetsuo. The second half hasn\u2019t even been started yet, but I\u2019m already growing bored of this project. So I guess this will have to suffice until I find more time/motivation.</p>\n<p>If your fuel runs out it just resets. Eventually I\u2019d intend for it to be Game Over, with the chance to pick up extra fuel as the game goes along (perhaps tied to the death of a biker). The idea would be you need to avoid obstacles and keep your fuel up. Your lazer gun is recharged via the bike engine (like in the film), so it burns up more fuel. Hitting anything bad drains fuel too (though if you hit a barricade at full speed you should be fine). The clown bikers swing green hockey sticks to attack you. The \u201ckm\u201d bar on the right charts your progress to the (non-existent) stadium. Each time you shoot a Clown biker it marks your kill count on the right. Clowns can die on barricades.</p>\n<p>Oh, an the reason the Kaneda sprite looks so ugly is I drew it first, about 6 months ago, and did the Clown biker today - obviously I was more artistically motivated. If I work on it some more I'll also try to use more sound files, since they're easy to add in QBasic. I found this site with sound files. For example I'd like to later have Kaneda saying his \"just when my coil was reaching the green line\" quote, to be used when the player presses ESC to finish the game, or after a Game Over.</p>\n<p>FUN FACT: the game was made without any arrays. I have never been able to work out how to do them properly, so I don\u2019t use them. Which is why there\u2019s only one biker and two barricades and I will never be able to elevate myself above 1980s era game design. Have fun, and don\u2019t complain about the music theft. This is a non-profit thing so I don\u2019t really care.<br/></p>\n<p>Source code is included!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/768412cf8d3258486ab43cb529f01e1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SZCZ GAMES"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
