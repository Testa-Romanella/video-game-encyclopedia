Being initially released in 2011 as a modification for Half-Live 2, it was entirely remade in 2013, featuring updated graphics and more content.  <br />\nThe game follows Stanley, an office worker whose job boils down to pressing buttons on the keyboard depending on what he sees on his office computer screen. One day the screen goes black and Stanley, not knowing what to do, decides to investigate the building. <br />\nThe gameplay consists of exploring a deserted office building. The game has 19 possible endings that depend on which way the player chooses to explore his surroundings. The Stanley Parable\u2019s key feature is the permanent presence of the narrator who comments protagonist\u2019s actions and suggests player what to do next. However, the player can ignore his suggestions which makes the narrator adjust his story to the player\u2019s actions.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2013-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f0/8f0b94922ad5e59968852649697b2643.jpg", "website": "http://stanleyparable.com", "rating": 4.37, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 288, "owned": 4473, "beaten": 2078, "toplay": 224, "dropped": 216, "playing": 27}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1964, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1980, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Galactic Cafe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Galactic Cafe"], "esrb_rating": null}
