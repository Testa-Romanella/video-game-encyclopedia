I watched the Shaun Spalding plat-former tutorial and this is my own spin on it. There's five levels but I may add more. I want to add more vertical\u00a0platforms, other guns, etc. but I have no idea how to right now as I'm still learning GML. Any tips on GML would be appreciated. Otherwise enjoy and thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Game is in a ZIP file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dc310d61d34f121cad74629ffdfbcb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YoungestBuck"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
