{"id": 539974, "slug": "distant-harmony", "name": "Distant Harmony", "name_original": "Distant Harmony", "description": "<p>Version 1 of Distant Harmony.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a card matching game where you must craft your cards in real time in order to attain victory. Every card represents an Idea, you have the power to combine ideas in order to modify attributes or to transform ideas entirely.</p>\n<p>Windows Build Only Available at the Moment.<br/></p>\n<p>In terms of development the game is finished. However, one day in the (far?) future I might update it to have better writing, as well as more formulas.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Detailed Description of Game:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Control scheme is very simple, left click what you want to make into the main idea, then you right click another idea that you want to join into the main idea. The right click will attempt to join the idea, but an idea can only join if it meets certain formulas. What are these formulas? That's for you to discover!</p>\n<p>This is a level based game where your goal is to gain harmony points until you beat each level. Every level has multiple phases each with different wandering cards. You cannot affect the cards that are wandering, but you can craft your own cards on the main 3 x 3  grid, and your job is to craft the cards that match the wandering cards.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Only cards that are on this main grid can be combined. When cards combine, the attributes on the main idea change, and certain thresholds will cause the idea to transform its identity, or sometimes emit an entirely new idea.</p>\n<p>Ideas that are emitted get stored on the card rack. The card rack is below the main grid, These cards need to be moved to the main map before they can be used. Play the game to get a more detailed tutorial on how this all works.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Miraj Alam: Game Design, Programming UI, Some Art<br/></p>\n\n<p>This license is what I followed, no money is made from this game: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</p>\n<p>Here are the exact links to all the royalty free assets that I used in this game.<br/>Chad Crouch:<br/>Headwaters(Instrumental) https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Chad_Crouch/Field_Report_Vol_II_Reed_Canyon_I...<br/>Algorithms https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Chad_Crouch/Arps/Algorithms<br/>Moonrise https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Chad_Crouch/Arps/Moonrise I, Alone In My Study by The Blessed Cassettes https://freemusicarchive.org/music/The_Blessed_Cassettes/Errors_and_Omissions/01...
