You are able to one punch enemies(most of them), but you are also one touch away from dying.\u00a0There are no checkpoints, so if you die , you will start over. The game is about your golden button from your pants, which has been stolen. You have to fight for your glory ( and your button, of course).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>LMB- Punch</p>\n<p>ESC-Pause Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/060a9d3ae04159918601c92e5ef7c431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xpanderex"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
