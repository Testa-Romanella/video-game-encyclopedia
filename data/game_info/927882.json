It's not as polished as I'd like, (I was working on too many jams at once. I've learnt my lesson.)but I hope you'll enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Controls - Just the arrow keys for the games.</p>\n<p>Press space to advance the intro text.</p>\n<p>You'll need to click the arrows to advance when you get to the wall of text.</p>\n<p>The opening is a bit longer than I would have liked, but I really wanted to push the theme of using sound to tell a story. If you'd like to skip it, hit ESC, though the audio will carry over till the second game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you fail any of the games, you'll have to restart unfortunaly, just a massive oversight on my part. Just don't fail, they're easy.</p>\n<p>Pressing R will restart the entire game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T18:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86a/86a573d17ab24007dacefbc6fdfe7678.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
