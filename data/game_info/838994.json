The level did restart; now click the \"Play\" button to play.</li>\n<li>Enemy movement causes them to cluster up in an uninteresting way.</li>\n<li>Sound effects are bleh.</li>\n<li>Menu transition when player is hit by enemy is abrupt and doesn't communicate well what happened.\r\n</li>\n<li>After the player is hit by an enemy and the player clicks the \"Play\" button, the player simply resumes and can safely back away from enemies.</li>\n<li>There is no win condition.
