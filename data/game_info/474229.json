The game's GUI interface should be very straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:<br/>- Press <strong>'R'</strong> to reset units<br/>- Use <strong>mouse scroll wheel</strong> to adjust view angle/distance</p>\n<p>You can also download from my google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d1Bof51rUvuI6ULFn4zwXVhs3o0MCwt1/view?usp=sharing. You can find a YouTube video on an earlier version of the game here\u00a0(some bugs in the video are fixed in this upload):\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLdRqGz59o0.</p>\n\n<p>This game is <strong>free and open source in principle</strong> but due to its size I didn't upload it to Github - however source files (UE4)\u00a0are available upon request.\u00a0Anyone is free to use this game for any reasonable purpose. All assets are created either by me or used official UE4 free assets/demo projects, with the exception of the default background music, which is from this open source project:\u00a0https://github.com/yingwang/chinese-chess.</p>\n<p>This game is not optimized but it should run without any performance issue (since it's so simple) on a moderate PC. I might add more visual interests and likely support for <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>(western)\u00a0Chess</strong> boards in the future. No plan for AI support - there are many existing good online/mobile games, please try them out. Also no plan for voice chat - please consider <strong>Discord</strong>. I might add simple text chat interface in the future if it comes handy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a6977e7488401b5900002087deb6c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charles Zhang"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
