Very cool right?</p>\n<p>Game look is based on discord\u00a0if you haven't noticed it yet. Server's name is Seikatsu, therefore name of the game must be a Seikatsu Simulator. \u00a0Also server is real so the nicknames in the chat are actual people from that server (most of them have more than one nickname so you might see same person but two different nicknames). Lastly, game is basically about you sending messages, and getting punishment for it. Oh cruel life.</p>\n<p>I might update this game from time to time just to add more names and messages, or change some information. If you want to check out the real server, you're very welcome, link is in \"More Information\"\u00a0(it's a chill community server).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:22:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b92/b9212ba7cb6df059925b1f5678517c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tserra"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
