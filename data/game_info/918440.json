There are 2 laps around 2 planets both have different gravitational pulls on your car. There is a basic gear system which will stall your car if you enter into a gear whilst not going fast enough or if you crash. You can also spin your car if you happen to land upside-down or just want to have fun doing barrel roles in the air, but once your wheels are on the ground you can no longer roll.<br/>If you get confused as to where the next checkpoint is just follow the arrow!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>W - Accelerate (when in gear 1 or above)<br/>S - Reverse\u00a0(when in gear R)<br/>A - Steer Left<br/>D - Steer Right<br/>Q - Roll Counter Clockwise<br/>E - Roll Clockwise<br/>Up Arrow - Go Up a gear (exit neutral)<br/>Down Arrow - Go down a gear/Enter reverse (exit neutral)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T10:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08a/08a9767f32f14f7d70e5b9ad61dd0823.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Kelly"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
