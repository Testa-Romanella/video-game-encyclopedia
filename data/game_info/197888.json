{"id": 197888, "slug": "sporkapult", "name": "Sporkapult", "name_original": "Sporkapult", "description": "<p>The goal is to work as a team to eliminate the knight on the castle. On a local network, one player is the Sporkapult and cannot see the enemy. The other player is a spy who is sending messages with emojis to the Sporkapult player, so that the player can hit the enemy castle. Careful though, you can accidentally hit the spy and lose. The game is meant to be played where the only communication is through the game emojis. Controls for the Sporkapult: A and D to move side to side. W and S to move up and down. Q and E to increase and decrease the power of the shot. Controls for the spy: WASD to move around. Space to jump. Right click to free your mouse cursor and click the emojis on the UI to send messages to the Sporkapult. If you don't have two computers, you can open two instances on the same computer to test the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d931f24b30b4f20974db5ac030982d42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["P10er101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
