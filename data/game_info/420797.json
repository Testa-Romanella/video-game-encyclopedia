FYI, there are still some known bugs. The player is a struggling farmer during the Great Depression. The farm is smack\u00a0dab in the middle of the dust bowl. The player finds a mysterious underground\u00a0reservoir. In a time where most people are unable to grow their crops, the player\u00a0finds the most valuable resource of all \u201cWater\u201d. Desperate people begin to lash out.\u00a0Additionally, people at the top of the area\u2019s social structure formulate a plan to profit\u00a0from the farmer by any means necessary.\u00a0The player will have to defend his farm from both the desperate and the greedy. The\u00a0player must also make sure his family and friends survive the harsh conditions that\u00a0accompanied the dust bowl\u2019s landscape. The game is a first person base defense,\u00a0focusing on crafting and placing traps in strategic locations while avoiding getting\u00a0detected and killed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T05:26:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59e9c2603b1caf88986ce47ebe60d1b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sonicworkflow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
