A single path leading you toward destiny.</p>\n<p>Moonchild is a (very) short\u00a0 RPGmaker project made in the month of March 2021 out of sheer bordem. Also a desire to create, but who really cares about that, right?\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>The game plays very much like a generic jRPG with a slight emphasis on conserving resources. I was only able to play test the game so much, and haven't had anyone else play through it, so it may be overly difficult/broken in some places and I wouldn't really know... <br/></p>\n<p>There's still a lot of RPGmaker default stuff present that I just haven't figured out how to change yet. Overall, don't take it too seriously.</p>\n<p> Hope to make more games in the future though.</p><p>- I used the Yanfly core engine plugin for this project, though I'm not sure I actually utilized it in anyway. Still, credit is due.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for looking at this!</p>\n<p>I have an Instagram if you want to check out my artwork when I actually post something - @difl.oo -</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T16:30:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca9/ca965a3383793b2238cd1d4672759b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Difloo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
