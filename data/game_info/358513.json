The theme was \"Don't Touch It\".</p>\n<p>It is still missing a soundtrack and SFX, I'm hoping to add them later, along with some much needed polish and more gameplay.</p>\n<p>That said, I'm pretty happy about it, as an almost solo prototype made with almost no crunch in three days. The core gameplay is there and I think it might have some potential beyond this jam.</p>\n<p>Feedback is much appreciated! Please let me know if you want feedback on one of your games too.</p>\n<p>Made by me (kcabra) and J\u00falio Moraes (julioribeiiro)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcd20942c84c3cf44f4fc6ecadef27bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["kcabra"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
