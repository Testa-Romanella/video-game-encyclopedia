{"id": 373633, "slug": "pillars-of-dust", "name": "Pillars of Dust", "name_original": "Pillars of Dust", "description": "Pillars of Dust is a retro-style RPG that aims to evoke nostalgia while keeping things fresh with elements of other genres - ranging from classic adventure games to arcade beat-em-ups.<br/><br/><br/>- Order is Important - choose the order you want to complete each character's chapters. Jump back and forth, or complete one hero's quest entirely before starting the next, yielding unexpected results!<br/>- Real-time RPG combat with enemies that increase in strength as battles wear on<br/>- Nostalgic 8-bit-style graphics with equally nostalgic chiptunes<br/>- Two-member party system with multiple (swappable) companion options, each bringing a unique skillset<br/>- Fast-paced gameplay: no grinding needed to advance, fast character movement, and menus that are not cumbersome to navigate<br/>- Old-fashioned humor: the plot may be heavy, but the dialogue and world building keep things light<br/>- Chicken nugget-based in-game economy<br/><br/><br/>Prince Carlton of Lerm and Gregg of Kadel are as different as can be. Carlton was raised in the lap of luxury - schooled in the art of swordplay and wanting for nothing, he has spent his life as the heir apparent to the Lermian throne. Gregg is a happy-go-lucky blacksmith's apprentice who has made the most of his hardscrabble upbringing in the slums of Kadel. Pillars of Dust opens to find Carlton and Gregg separately embarking on quests to learn about their pasts and the secrets of the lost kingdom of Alluriga. Neither man knows of the other's existence, but their paths will run parallel as they venture into the ruins of a forgotten civilization seeking fortune and enlightenment. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Pillars of Dust opens with a character select screen: think old-school beat-em-up games, perhaps featuring toads. That's your first hint that this isn't your mama's 8-bit RPG. You can play through the game as Carlton, then switch to Gregg. You can switch back and forth after each chapter. The choice is yours, but the order in which you complete the game has an impact on the world: pass through an area with Carlton, and Gregg might come across the same place - minus the items that Carlton already took. With Pillars of Dust, no two playthroughs will be exactly the same.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13db0b35432063cae0158c00e28e51d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retreaux Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Something Classic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
