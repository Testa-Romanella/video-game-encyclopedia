I worked on this for about two months, making most of the assets myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a classical adaptation of the popular gamemode Hero Line Defense from many of the Blizzard games. You spawn minions for your enemies, which in turn provide you with <em>income</em>, i.e. money you get every 5 seconds. But if you spend all your money on minions, you will not be able to defend yourself from the minions in your lane. As such, the player always has to balance these conflicting ideas. Attack or Defend?</p>\n<p>Multiplayer is also supported, make sure to open TCP/UDP 7777 port, which seems to be the default port for Unreal Engine projects.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T16:07:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/ace5bb43ad1553d997065118cb75da7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wolffrog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
