It was designed for the development of mobile or low-income games, it contains the vertices painted to simulate the affectation by the movement of the wind and they share a single texture and a single material, it has a unity double-sided shader, a movement function of vertices and a shading for a single directional light, this allows better performance and more volume. for more information visit my page</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f568e332131c59dfa27950264daa6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DarkcomTech"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
