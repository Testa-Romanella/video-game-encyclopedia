By being afraid that I'll make something bad, I'm preventing myself from making anything, not to mention making anything <em>good.</em> I know that this game isn't great and that the poems are mediocre; I haven't coded in years and I hardly write anything anymore, and I made this in the short span of a couple late-night half-delirious hours;\u00a0but it honestly just felt really good to create again. This game is my way of finally getting past that creative blockage. Thanks for playing it.</p>\n<p><em>Side Note: there's supposed to be ambient audio but it doesn't seem to be working, so just imagine cool music &amp; nature sounds in the background.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T06:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/078/078640e7829b2d037d038f2fd7980f5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["carbonatedavocados"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
