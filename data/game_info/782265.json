{"id": 782265, "slug": "cube-2007", "name": "Cube (2007)", "name_original": "Cube (2007)", "description": "<p>Cube is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</p>\n<p>The cube is &quot;sticky&quot; and as such it is able to roll to the sides of the bottom of a track to approach an area from a different direction or to collect new items. Only special squares cannot be moved over. The camera can also be rotated around the cube to view the environment before moving. Certain levels are time limited. The game includes a level editor and new levels can be stored and shared with friends. Multiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with the modes Battle, Co-Op, Collect and Race. While progressing players can unlock new music tracks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-07T20:35:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c6/7c6df9fa8e7aa989351c9bfc851e0ee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
