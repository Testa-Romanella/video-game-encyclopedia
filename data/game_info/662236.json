I am humbled to see my game selected for such an honor. &lt;3<br/><br/>(Made in 48 hours as part of the Full-Time Game Dev Game Jam. Theme: \"The Golden Rule\").<br/></p>\n\n<p>###### =- Other Unnecessary Information -= ######<br/></p>\n<p>Get Yeetin' is my first-ever Game Jam project and \u2014 interestingly \u2014 my first \"commercial\" project (if one could even call it that).</p>\n<p>Get Yeetin' had many bumps during its development. The first 24 hours worth of work had to be scrapped due to the original project just not being fun. Luckily, some code was able to be salvaged! Which honestly is the only reason I was able to finish the project.<br/></p>\n<p>One of my goals for this project was to start entirely fresh. Being an individual who likes to do things the 'right' way (which usually is never\u00a0 the fastest way), I tend to love making ridiculously over-engineered systems. When Full-Time Game Dev announced that there was to be an upcoming Game Jam \u2014 I knew I had to participate to get some much needed perspective and to free myself of my current development nightmare.</p>\n<p>Get Yeetin' is an (albeit slightly laggy) game made from the necessity to break my game-dev habits. I really took off the reigns for this project and just let myself run as fast as possible. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:56:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/281/281dc0672767fef422c7170804ecc150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["OvercharmStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
