All the view transitions colliders are viewable and clickable from all points, allowing you to warp around, which is good and fine since I didn't leave myself anytime to adjust their positions properly. I'll fix this up but just to be fair, have a look at the morbid state this was in at end time. Also something REALLY weird happened with the raycast checks for the WebGL(probably because it has it's own little screen frame) so good luck navigating. (quick fix) Also you might want to put some music on :V <br/></p><p>Just a short walk</p><p>Use the mouse to Point N' Click N' Rotate</p><p>Skyboxes made with a Blender Equirectangular camera and Panorama to Cubemap 1.0 (free off the asset store)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/793/793c9f706b75c4da7057e78b57a3ed47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loon Of Nature"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
