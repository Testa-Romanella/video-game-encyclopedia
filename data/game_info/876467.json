{"id": 876467, "slug": "survival-in-the-backrooms", "name": "SURVIVAL IN THE BACKROOMS", "name_original": "SURVIVAL IN THE BACKROOMS", "description": "Survival In The Backrooms is an atmospheric horror game in which you will wander for a long time through surreal corridors and rooms in search of a way out. Immerse yourself in this mysterious world and try not to become prey for its inhabitants. This game is based on the famous creepypasta and has a large number of references and recognizable elements. Explore seemingly endless liminal spaces, search for supplies and avoid dangerous entities. Remember that there is no way out of Backrooms. No one has ever managed to get out of here. You can only go further, to the next level, if you guess how to do it. You will have to explore each room to find useful items or hints that will allow you to move on.<h3>Levels</h3>You will find yourself in the monotonous yellow rooms of level zero, swim in deep pools in Poolrooms and walk around the overgrown office at level 150. As a rule, the levels are a fairly large maze. You should be very careful to figure out how to get out of here and be careful enough not to disturb the local inhabitants.<br/><h3>Entities</h3>In one of the many inconspicuous rooms, you can suddenly hear strange sounds, the monotonous hiss of an old broken TV, and then the loud trampling of someone's huge feet. If you find yourself in such a situation, you are most likely the end.<br/><h3>Weapons and Items</h3>To survive in the Backrooms, you will need to look for weapons, essentials and dispose of them correctly. A pistol and a few rounds of ammunition can help you survive a collision with the entity, and food, water and medicine will restore your strength. Of course, resources will always be in short supply here. Put everything you can find in your backpack!<br/><h3>Gameplay Features</h3><ul><li> You have to explore three big confusing levels<br/></li><li> Entities can meet in the most unpredictable places<br/></li><li> Find weapons and other useful items.
