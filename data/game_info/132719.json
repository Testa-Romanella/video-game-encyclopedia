What few humans are left form small close-knit groups and create settlements that they surround with barricades to close themselves off from the rest of the world. People have become untrusting of others and don't dare to journey outside their own settlements. They say people who do go mad and no one is sure why.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as someone who has been exiled from their settlement. Worried the isolation might make them go insane as the rumors suggest, they journey out to find other humans before it's too late.</p>\n<p>If you play the demo, please consider filling out a short 10 question feedback survey to help us improve the game going forward: Survey Link<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Zachary Singer - Creative Lead / Gameplay Programmer / Game Designer / 3D Modeler</li><li>Ron Burgess - 3D Modeler / Game Designer</li><li>Rahee Mehra - 3D Modeler / Game Designer</li><li>The character controller is by Grant Marrs via the Unity Asset Store.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bbce54bd71f29979e464cabce20656.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zlsinger"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
