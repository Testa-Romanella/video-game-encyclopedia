Whatever. Our previous subjects kept dying on us, so you\u2019ll have to do. Just stand there and destroy the turrets before they destroy you. Oh, and please do your best to not suck like the others. What do you mean there're too many of them? Sigh, are you that slow? Just suck in what the turrets are hitting you with and fire back a huge explosive shot! Also, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, (which I doubt you have, with your dimwittedness) the lasers are dangerous too. And they're fast. You might want to avoid them if you have any attachment to life, not that it matters to us. Don't worry, if the worst happens, there're others waiting to take your place. But DO try and stay alive anyway, we can\u2019t afford to keep replacing test dummies.FEATURES<ul><li> Awesome Laser Blasters: They really are quite awesome<br/></li><li> Slow Time: Dodge and shoot in style when things get too fast for you.<br/></li><li> Suck Enemy Bullets: Charge up your weapons by sucking in enemy bullets and firing back a huge explosive shot<br/></li><li> Compete in Online and Local Leaderboards: Prove yourself as the best test subject.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/4734aac84ec47accd3c2a566ad6a804e.jpg", "website": "http://www.actuallysanestudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Actually Sane Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Actually Sane Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
