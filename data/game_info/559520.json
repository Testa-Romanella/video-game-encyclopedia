Right-click cancels spells!</p>\n<p>Spells are currently unchangeable and very cryptic. Here's a brief explanation:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Magic Missile</strong></em>. A single-target ranged spell that deals 1 damage. Monsters have 3 hit points.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Create Rock</strong></em>. Summons a rock in the target tile. Rocks are indestructible.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Create Booster</strong></em>. Summons a magical booster that instantly moves you 3 tiles in the desired direction. When you cast this spell, you have to select a target position AND direction, relative to the previously selected position.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Deflective Ward</strong></em>. Makes all abilities target at you be deflected to the nearest target available. Not very useful because you are the only creature capable of targeting others... or is it?<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Create Resonant Energizer</strong></em>. Summons a crystal that powers your spells up as long as you are near it. It adds +1 damage to your spells\u00a0<em>for each status you currently have</em> (hint: the only status in the game right now is\u00a0<em>deflective ward</em>).</p>\n<p>Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3a86c0892b34b5814f3d9949f0b92e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kazuo256"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
