One of the main mechanics of the game is that your character can charge up his jumps to move freely around the map,\u00a0you can also upgrade specific parts of the\u00a0mech after each wave.</p><p>i've been working on this project over the last semester, it all started from a couple of ideas/concepts i shared with friends and i decided to make this game out of it, we are huge fans of top down shooter games like gauntlet, helldivers and alien swarm so they definetly helped for inspiration. I made this game on Unreal Engine 4 alone using only blueprints for code and no addons.</p><p>All the 3d models\u00a0of the game will soon be available to download on my itch.io profile, that s right\u00a0you ll be able to use the same map and characters as i did for your projects! and most of them will be free too :p\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0for the stuff i didnt make myself:</p><p>sound effects from\u00a0\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/</p><p>some of them are just default UE4 included sounds/music<br/></p><p>dont hesitate to check out the other stuff on my profile and follow me for more, you can also donate if you want, i try to keep most of my assets free but i d like to make a living out of 3d art/modelling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>if you ever want my help for your projects i can do commissions for you and your group, all you have to do is contact me via discord on my profile: Niko#8318\u00a0 \u00a0 or via email here:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0guillaume.bolis.neko@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T06:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f3/8f356f4ebd946760d289570b2db7af81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["niko-3d-models"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
