{"id": 600413, "slug": "clicky-galaxy", "name": "Clicky Galaxy", "name_original": "Clicky Galaxy", "description": "Clicky Galaxy\r\n<p><strong>Clicky Galaxy </strong>is a casual point-and-click, match-three game developed with Unity.</p>\n<p>Click on a planet and then click on a destination for it to move to. If there isn't a valid path (planets can only move horizontally or vertically but not diagonally), the planet will remain in place and you may click to deselect it. Three or more in a row or column result in a match and you win points! New planets are spawned every time after you move and the game ends when planets fill up the entire grid.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you experience issues with itch.io's browser play (for example, high score not being recorded because of a lack of support for Unity's PlayerPrefs, or, game stuck on loading because your browser disables cookies), you may also check out Clicky Galaxy on Unity Play.
