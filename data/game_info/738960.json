Apocalypse Simulator - a 10 line game for 64k Atari 800xl</p>\n<p>Written by Craig Miller aka PREPPIE aka @Retro-Homebrew</p>\n<p>Category: PUR-80</p>\n\n<p>STORY:</p>\n<p>You play a survivor in the zombie apocalypse.\u00a0 CDCs from around the world have been working on an anti-virus, and they have air dropped their parts to a safe location.\u00a0 Your job is to combine the individual work of the CDCs into a final compound and disperse it into the atmosphere to end the zombie plague.\u00a0 Unfortunately a number of zombies have broke into the safe zone, so you must avoid these while doing your vital work.\u00a0 Hurry, people are dying every second around the world and only you can save them.</p>\n\n<p>GAMEPLAY</p>\n<p>You control the player that starts at the top of the screen.\u00a0 Use the joystick to walk around and push the crates.\u00a0 When you push two identical crates together they will combine into a new crate.\u00a0 Once all crates have been combined into the final anti-virus, give it one more push to disperse it into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Don't worry about a crate getting stuck on the wall, keeping push and you'll flip it around.\u00a0 What you need to worry about are those zombies, avoid them or block their path with a crate, because a single touch means death.</p>\n<p>If you die you will be given a score of zero, but if you succeed you will be shown how fast you saved the world (lower score is faster and better).\u00a0 Either way this is just a simulator to get you ready for the actual event.\u00a0 Try again (by typing RUN<enter>) and see if you can beat your time, you need the practise as the real event starts soon.</enter></p>\n\n<p>***** 10 line listing
