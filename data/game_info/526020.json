{"id": 526020, "slug": "metatanks-beta", "name": "Metatanks (Beta)", "name_original": "Metatanks (Beta)", "description": "<p>Metatanks is a simple twin-stick shooter. You have a tank, you shoot projectiles that bounce off of walls, and you are tasked with blowing up everything that moves, and a good chunk of what doesn't.\u00a0Not enough stuff to blow up in the base game? Well, there's a level editor, so you can make levels with the same complexity as official levels.</p>\n<p>Please note, this game's still beta. It's incomplete and buggy. It's very playable, but know you aren't getting a particularly polished experience.<br/></p>\n<p>Due to limitations of the engine, I'm only able to make official compiles of this game for Windows. However, one of my beta testers has had good luck running the game on Linux using Wine. I can't confirm everyone will have the same luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T05:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168779813708e996ae9fa4cf60ffd4b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
