This week's theme was Enlighten me, and all I could think about was how difficult it is to make someone hostile understand something. For example:<br/>- \"I don't think being queer is wrong.\"<br/>- \"Oh yeah? Enlighten me.\"</p>\n<p>Played entirely with the mouse, left click lights and hope for the left. Get them all green and you win!<br/></p>\n<p>I wondered how to translate this best in 30 minutes, and I remembered a little frustrating puzzle game I used to play as a kid: Lights On / Lights Off. 3x3 grids of light that turned on or off themselves and their neighbors when clicked. So I made it my own and did this silly little thing. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T05:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea35b920f7716393554e772aaed2ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["enbyrielle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
