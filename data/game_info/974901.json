This convention is your only chance to meet the new, high-tech animatronics based on your favorite vtuber group, VchiBan! And you're determined to meet your oshis at any cost.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe only problem is that their meet-and-greet sold out before you could buy a ticket; limited supply and all that. The only way you'll be able to meet your oshis at Dweebcon is by breaking into the convention center and counterfeiting a ticket. Y'know, as one does.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou have the ticket file and the best printer in the world; all it will take is one good print of the ticket. This shouldn't take too long, right?  Throughout five nights, you must remain hidden within the convention center security office as the printer churns away at your prized possession. You'll have to micromanage the printer and deal with mechanical issues such as the ink running out or the fuses bursting.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, your oshis are roaming the convention center, eager to meet you even before you have your ticket. Be careful to conserve power, as the shutters and lights use electricity, and the convention center is strict about power usage within the security booth.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd if you run out of power -- or if your oshis find you before you have your ticket...? You're a gamer, I'm sure this will be no problem for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T07:46:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c80f5a70400a928d5a5125239c21249.jpg", "website": "https://vchiban.com/gamecorner/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VchiBan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VchiBan"], "esrb_rating": null}
