Each Chapter of the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian moon.\u00a0<br/><br/>A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a sister who must be saved through the power of basketball.</p>\n<ul><li>Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the impromptu courts of Paris\u00a0</li><li>Each Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are the strange chapters.</li><li>Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled. For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and the percussion stops.\u00a0</li><li>Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping off the screen.</li><li>Included with the game! :D<ul><li>The BasketBelle EP: Full Soundtrack + Bonus Tracks (MP3) + Cover Art\u00a0</li><li>BasketBelle sketchbook: Full-color PDF including sketches and liner notes</li><li>Browser version of\u00a0BasketBelle\u00a0(playable on Mac and Linux as well)</li><li>Access to\u00a0Making Of Featurette!
