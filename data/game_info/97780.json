In Crumble, the world is a platform that consists of boxes, and one by one they fall away. The idea is simple: if you fall, you lose.</p>\n<p><strong>In the multiplayer mode</strong>, you have access to a range of powerups that help you mess with your opponents. Try knocking them over the edge - the last man standing wins the game! This is kinda the intended way to play the game.</p>\n<p><strong>In the singleplayer mode</strong>, you play a time-attack style game where you try to last as long as possible. The old rules still stand, including a countdown clock: if you run out of time, you lose.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in under 48 hours, during the 38th Ludum Dare competition. Source code can be found under the download list. The theme was \"small world\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a5/6a5165cdf82277e826f73de07ae4dd56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BinarySpark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
