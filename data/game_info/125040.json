The graphics are designed to be absolute minimalist in style but hit upon that old Atari 2600 feel.  In the same simplistic manner the game is all about movement.  Simple  to understand but hard to master.  Use the arrow or w,a,s,d keys to move the player around.  Dodge spikes, trigger secret pressure plates just don't get killed.  Go ahead and see if you have what it takes to make it out of Keltar's Lair.</p><p>The game was made with the Blender Game Engine.  If you want to see how it was built, add more rooms or simply modify it to your own liking all you need is Blender 3D 2.7 or later.  From there just open the \"data\" folder and all of the source files are in there. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b23ea4ad87fb33f5e1cbefa99d79fc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matt Lucas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
