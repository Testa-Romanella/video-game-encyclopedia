SEA HERO QUEST VR is the world\u2019s first VR game where anyone can help scientists fight dementia. One of the first symptoms of dementia is loss of navigational skills, and through our mobile game SEA HERO QUEST we have already gathered a substantial amount of data. Now science would love to deepen insights into how people navigate. As you play, your navigational data is tracked anonymously and stored securely to create the world\u2019s largest and most precise crowd sourced data to help benchmark human spatial navigation. Created by GLITCHERS, presented by Deutsche Telekom and supported by scientists from University College London and University of East Anglia, SEA HERO QUEST VR is an epic culmination of science and VR gameplay that will continue to change the way dementia research is done forever.
