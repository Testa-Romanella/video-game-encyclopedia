I wanted to create and\u00a0implement a new system that can work as a secondary objective in the game, and can\u00a0be expanded upon immensely in the future. The game\u00a0is a 2-player tank fighting arena game in a abandoned desert military base. Player 1 uses awsd for movement and space for firing, and Player 2 uses arrow keys for movement and enter for firing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4ff978ed83ba87e7610d0afe0d03373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hanktutt"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
