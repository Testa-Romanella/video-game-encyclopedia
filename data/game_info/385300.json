Lately, the Vorles System has been rowdy, what with the invading armies of all-terrain killer robots and such. That\u2019s not what\u2019s important though. Something is tugging at your heart, and you\u2019re certain there\u2019s someone out there that feels it too.\u00a0 It\u2019s been awhile of lonesome time in the cosmos. Being a combat spacecraft isn\u2019t as easy without a companion. Perhaps this year, it\u2019s time to start a conquest for love.</p>\n<p>Hyperspace Lover\u2019s Conquest is a bullet hell/ dating sim hybrid that centers around spending time with spaceship girls amidst an invasion of hostile, all-terrain killing machines. Have fun with your date in enjoyable activities, and destroying pursuing robots between each wave. By working together during combat, you can form a better bond. Choose between three girls, and experience their stories in the form of both a visual novel, and an intense bullet-hell segment. Included also are boss battles, weapon changing system, companionship systems, and bombs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\n<p>AN0N (Main Character): Black ship, very protagonist-y\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RE1: hot color pallet mostly red, feisty, very opinionated, hates green onions, enjoys cosplaying in secret, short temper but has a lot of passion and love for living.
