You are a teenager fighting with negative thoughts and shitty situations through his day that drain his power.</p>\n<p>This game was an attempt to tell a story about depression and just how persistent it can be and really drain the power of people. But also about people helping eachother, even if they have problems.\u00a0<br/>We realized now the idea was more ambitious than we anticipated. Also we had nobody in our small team of three who could dedicate time for the story-telling. But it was a very interesting experiment of trying out something new, and trying to create a game that tries to help people. We learned a lot from this experiment.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>Michael Denissov ,\u00a0Benjamin 'Zonalar' Hauri, Daniel 'KinraX88' Sch\u00fctz</p>\n<p>Music/BackgroundSounds: Sergey Cheremisinov, robinhood76, lebcraftlp,iesp</p>\n<p><strong>SourceCode:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The source was made with Unity 2017.1.0f3 / VS2017CE</p>\n<p>GitHub<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43d0c0e246a8992482f1178fdd3821d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KinraX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
