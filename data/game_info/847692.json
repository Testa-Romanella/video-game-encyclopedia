Who knows who will win this fight.\u00a0<br/><br/>It's an experimental hybrid of an AutoBattler/Chess and a Card Game, where gods fight in the skies (on the left side of the screen)\u00a0and all their actions affect ordinary people on the ground\u00a0(on the right side of the screen).\u00a0<br/><br/>You can help your sky units in battle, but it hurts your people on the ground. Defeat Anubis before your \"earth army\" dies.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T16:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90fdf6e5172c2e358622d10094bf0ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kapodastr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
