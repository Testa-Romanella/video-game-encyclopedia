In this game, players embody intrepid ninjas who compete in frantic races full of traps.\r\n\r\nPlayers start each race on a starting platform suspended in the air. From there, they must run, jump, and navigate through a series of ninja-inspired obstacles, such as climbing walls, moving platforms, rotating blades, swinging pillars, and much more.\r\n\r\nUnlike \"Fall Guys,\" where the race mainly takes place on a horizontal surface, this \"Ninja Race Like\" introduces a significant vertical element. Players must climb, scale, and jump from platform to platform to reach the top of each level. Some courses may even include sections where players have to climb a massive tower or scale a mountain.\r\n\r\nThe game features a variety of levels, each with its own unique theme and challenges. For example, players might find themselves navigating through a dense forest filled with ninja traps, scaling futuristic skyscrapers in a cyberpunk city, or facing deadly challenges in an ancient temple.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the solo mode, Wacky Jumpers offers an online multiplayer mode where players can compete in competitive races with up to 50 players. The races are fast and frantic, with players eliminated at each stage until only one ninja manages to reach the finish line.\r\n\r\nWacky Jumpers offers a dynamic and competitive gaming experience, blending the excitement of frantic races with the verticality of ninja challenges. With its fast-paced gameplay, diverse levels, and extensive customization options, the game promises hours of entertainment for players seeking thrills and online competition.\r\n\r\nBe the first ninja to cross the finish line using a full range of movements : Slidable Slopes, Wall Running, Sprint, Crouch, Dodge, Evade, Dash, Vault, Climb, Wall Jump, Slide, Swim, Zipline, Beam Walk, Parachute, Ladder Climb.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T10:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/497/497982e61bf239a6848189bcc65e91af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Asgard Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio Asgard Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
