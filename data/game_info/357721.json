One day your family had to travel to work abroad so they sent you to live with your aunt who also has a daughter that is younger than you. Your aunt had to work for a week outside town so she cannot take care of her daughter, so she asked you to do that instead. One day you realize your cousin is adopting a strange behavior, as if she was not herself. You find out later, that she turns into a zombie at night so you tell your aunt  but as expected, who would believe such a thing. Therefore, you decided to take pictures of her in the act and prove it to your aunt. Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:37:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/428ccaca08cb8447929bff4b10cdfcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raed Tabani"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
