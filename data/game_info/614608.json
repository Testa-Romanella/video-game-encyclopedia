In three hours,\u00a0I created a mini game where you play \"Whaley\" - a kind but very hungry whale. Go out and collect\u00a0 as much tasty fish as you can - but be careful! Avoid the two watchtowers that are trying to spot Whaley and shoot him! (He kind of got a bad reputation as he ate all the fish last year, leading to angry fishermen and a desperate local government which lost a lot of fish-related revenue last year).</p>\n<strong>WASD to move to fish; avoid lighttowers by hiding behind rocks; fish disappears after 12s;\u00a0no winning condition - just eat all you can :)</strong>\n<p>All assets (code, art and music) are handcrafted by myself within the three hour period.</p>\n<p>Time needed:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Art: 1.5 hrs (hand drawn, scanned, imported)</li><li>Coding/Unity:\u00a01.25 hrs (movement script, detection beam, fish spawner, menu)</li><li>Music:\u00a00.25 hrs (google music lab - no time for proper composing)</li></ul>\n<p>I think this might be my best Trijam submission sofar; it looks reasonably polished, has a bit more gameplay than usually and has a semi-cute art style (I used graphite to make the drawing, scanned it and added a bit of grey coloring for the watch towers).</p>\n<p>I got inspired to do a bit of black-and-white art by this nice farily unknown channel:\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to turn drawings into game art<br/></p>\n<p>I want to point out that I finally bothered to bring my menu to life; a simple mouse over hover on the whale and the buttons actually improved the feeling alot :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41c4dc10f5891cfdac73cc29c98c0f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
