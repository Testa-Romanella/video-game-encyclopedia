All you have to do is sort the rubbish into the correct bins. You can play as long as you like but the bin will eventually overflow.

Please do feel to leave some comments with your constructive criticisms.</p>\n<p>The art of the hero in the game came from\u00a0\u00a0a poster detailing the recycling systems at the University I attended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e481685a93e0bb9a57531c10cd87e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Fluffy Dino"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
