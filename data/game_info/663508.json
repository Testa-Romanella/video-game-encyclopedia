This game was made for \"STOP WAITING FOR GODOT\" jam hosted by\u00a0Terry Cavanagh. It is a basic space shoot-em-up game where you defend your planet against alien ufo's. This is the first game I have ever made. So I am deeply grateful for Terry Cavanagh\u00a0for creating this game jam, thank you.
