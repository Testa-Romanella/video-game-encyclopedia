This my first attempt at bitsy so it's a little rough and probably has a lot of bugs.</p>\n<p>In the sprawling metropolis of Aviariopolis, darkness lurks. It's up to our friendly, feathery \"Bird Nest Heroes\" to save the day from the rampaging giant turkey.<br/>Meet the team:<br/>Redbird-- your bold and rash leader who is as incapable as he is cliche<br/>Bluebird-- the real runner of things, they're who you go to when you need sound advice<br/>Greenbird - prefers the term \"turquoise\", but she's given up at this point<br/>Magentabird - is really only in it for the money<br/>And you, Yellowbird- the only one who can actually get stuff done.</p>\n<p>Make sure to talk to the star-like things for dialogue in \"cutscenes\".
