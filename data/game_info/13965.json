I like making little action-packed and pig-based games, but I'm very bad at introductions. Iron Snout is my first Steam release, but you can find a couple of my other games scattered around mobile marketplaces and itch.io. If you'll have time to do that let me know what you think about my games via tweet or email! Hope to see you soon!Special thanksStore art: <strong>Steffen Wittig</strong><br/>Background music: <strong>weirdnoises</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T20:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4848bcf4deb6eeb3228048c7497dc1a6.jpg", "website": "http://games.snoutup.com/iron-snout", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 1062, "beaten": 34, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 46, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 196, "ratings_count": 112, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 113, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ratalaika Games", "SnoutUp"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SnoutUp"], "esrb_rating": null}
