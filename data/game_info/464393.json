Bob is a kind boy, but Intelligence isn't one of his strong points, so, you will need to keep pushing him around so he can complete the level.</p>\n<p><strong>The game is played by dragging boxes and other various objects to push Bob around and keep him alive while going to the right to complete the level.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made along with its art in 21 hours and 9 minutes for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 themed \"Out of Control\" by Sufian Diraneyya (Programming) and Sirin Diraneyya (Art &amp; Game Design). This is almost the first game that we ever completed so we hope you like it!</p>\n<p>The time wasn't enough to implement many of our ideas or even add a main menu. It's a prototype!</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0Alexander Nakarada</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/696018e0963491cbbb6d5f27c838492a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sufian Diraneyya"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
