Well good luck with that. But here's a shallow simulator of it instead.<br/><br/>This game was made for a personal 24-hour challenge. Total project time: 3 day 6~ hours, over the course of 7 days...</p>\n<p>As you can tell this project took much longer than I\u00a0had originally intended. But this being my very first project that I had ever finished it was only to be expected. In the end however, I can't help but feel accomplished all the same. The game may have several more bugs that I didn't find, the gameplay will probably be the most boring thing you've touched this week. But it's finished.<br/><br/>I hope that in the weeks and months to come I can continue to ride this momentum and release many more games with increasing quality and skill.<br/><br/>If you spent any amount of time playing or reading this, hi there how's it going?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T04:52:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd24ab149cda7cabf8e70a8f574eb044.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garden of Sen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
