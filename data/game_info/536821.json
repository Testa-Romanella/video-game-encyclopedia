If people enjoy the game I\u00a0will continue to work on the game until after Christmas. Let me know what you think, I appreciate criticism just as much as praise,\u00a0Thanks\u00a0:)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T08:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8a9cf95bcb4b7b4ff0a416f74a16228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshtapus"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
