A magical substance known as contrivium was spilled onto his reactor model, causing the convention center to undergo a magical girl zombie apocalypse. Both merchandise and attendee alike have been transformed into malevolent magical girls. In the ensuing chaos, Jordan was bitten by a radioactive cosplayer and became the superheroine known as Lunar Heart Skydancer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlong with her friends, she now must defeat the evil sorcerer-of-culture, Victor Haqdev, who is using his foul chaos magics to force every animal, mineral, and vegetable into his harem of magical girls. Will Jordan and the other survivors escape this anime-convention-gone-wrong, or will she experience humiliating objectification?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPIF is a top-down shooter with a shmup soul. Dodge hundreds of bullets in 360 degree danmaku.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDo you have a life with time constraints? This game is designed with you in mind. The gameplay experience has been deliberately simplified to keep the player actually in the action playing the game. There are no skill trees to min-max, no wikis to look up, no exploration to get you lost, and no NPCs to interact with. RNG is shunned. Rogue-like elements have been punched in the gut and kicked down the stairs. This deliberate simplicity ensures that 30 minute block of time you have for gaming is actually spent gaming.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T12:32:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37b/37bf2f51b75f66c271cbfa24b87b449d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Project Stunseed"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
