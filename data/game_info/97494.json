Explore a train station during the Cold War as a spy, from a different and higher point of view; shoot \"high quality photos\", but be thrifty: you have only one film roll! Don't lose your target or you will lose the opportunity to take the perfect shot!</p>\n<p><strong>The team</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Team UnderCover is a group formed in February 2017 by five MSc. Game Design and Technology students at IT University of Copenhagen. The team's first project is Espial: The Eye from Above and was developed as a project within the university; as inspiration, the following games were used: Mirror's Edge and Assassin's Creed as well as the early James Bond films.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contacts</strong></p>\n<p>Site:\u00a0espial.eu</p>\n<p>E-mail: espial@espial.eu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a26/a26e71d0e5fa1da38e22d7a8252943c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["undercover"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
