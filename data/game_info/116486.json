Really, there is not even one. You can see only physics debug draw. I also had no time to make win / lose condition. Have fun!<br/></p><p>Game was made with <strong>LibGDX</strong> for LibGDX Game Jam in last two days. for lighting I used awesome box2dlights.</p><p><strong>SOURCE (quite clean and well commented):</strong> https://github.com/lukz/grow</p><p><strong>Follow me on twitter!</strong> https://twitter.com/lukz_dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de2447a4a7da7f5e026f4874d715d95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lukz_dev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
