I went really old school on this (think Ultima 3 on the atari 800)</p><p>Setting is in space, you must protect your engine room from enemy spies who seek to disable your ship before you can make it to Alpha Prime.<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>WASD  to move,  R to ready or use a weapon, armor, or a medkit. 1-6 to select the inventory slot and R to ready or use the item if it is in the slot.</p><p>Trying to move onto an enemy is an automatic attack, make sure to 'Ready' weapons, armor, and medkits to use appropriately. This game will go on and on for now, unless you meet your fate early.</p><p>This is early development and meant for a game jam, I would like an excuse to make a full blown game out of this style (donations would definitely help), perhaps 4 times as big as ultima 3 was, with NPCs, quests, etc.</p><p>Engine used is godot, mechanics are ultra simple and gameplay is light to moderate. </p><p>Released for Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea540fdba9adaa8b92b5a0dbb9a9e30a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["eflake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
