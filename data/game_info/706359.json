Several images exist of a character in poses &amp; outfits that some audiences may find sexy/provocative.</em></p>\r\nFurther Info\r\n<p><em>Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle</em> is a series of indie \"anime courtroom drama adventure\" games, made by solo developer Ethan Fox for Tanuki-sama Studios.</p>\n<p>NALE was originally released on itchio as a webgame in late 2018, to initial success.
