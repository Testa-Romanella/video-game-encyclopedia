You have to avoid attacks and also charge up your blue ring to escape from boss fights. There are also a few <strong>puzzles</strong>. This game will also work with a controller.</p>\n<p>The goal is to dodge dangerous attacks and also stand still which will charge the blue ring. Once the ring is\u00a0charged you can escape the boss fight. You can also jump over attacks by pressing space or A on a controller (this has a cool down).\u00a0However you can't jump over spiky obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 WASD or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>\u2022 Space Bar to jump</p>\n<p><strong>Controller:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Left Stick to move</p>\n<p>\u2022 A to jump</p>\n<p>This is just the demo, but the full version will come out sometime in <strong>2020!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d670a9911d1614bd4f4c7c5fb1e07ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sierpinski Simon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
