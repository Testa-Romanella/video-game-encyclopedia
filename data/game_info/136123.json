Your technological empire must stand!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Expanded instructions: You can charge the target (the HQ your minions are trying to attack) and switch a tile with another one right next to it to create a path. Your minions are kinda dumb, don't expect much from them. Escape resets the game.</em></p>\n<p>Fun fact: We made two one-day-jams in a single weekend.</p>\n<p>art &amp; design: Isabel Tallos</p>\n<p>code &amp; design:\u00a0Ludipe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ee/3ee3330efb03825bb984e7ae7e2bde19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
