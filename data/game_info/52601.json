It is the first Star Wars video game to feature lightsaber action. The goal of the game, based on one scene in the original Star Wars film, is to take out the opponent with the Seeker ball while defending oneself from incoming laser blasts using one's lightsaber.</p>\n<p>Following the impressive-enough sales of their first Star Wars game of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Parker Brothers went on to continue developing Star Wars titles, one of which is Star Wars: Jedi Arena, programmed by Rex Bradford. Although the game's reception was mixed at the time of release, with sound effects being praised and primarily the abstract combat being criticized, its legacy is largely negative, with several modern critics referring to the game as one of the worst Star Wars games of all time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-29T12:24:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3bbd7d9420a91ea5cbd7be3343f14f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 55, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Parker Brothers"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Parker Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
