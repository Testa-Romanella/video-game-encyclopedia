And is beset on all sides by its humble inhabitants, the Skelis.</p>\n<p><strong>Skelis</strong></p>\n<p>These adorable abominations don't seem to want to leave you alone. Did you say something mean? Lucky for you they aren't too fast and they're a bit floppy. But they have numbers on their side.</p>\n<p><strong>Physics Nonsense</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Skelis don't have much holding them together (except for their unified hatred of you). They go all ragdoll-y if you get a couple clean shots off. Be sure to not trip over their bodies as you run from their still\u00a0<em>un</em>dead compatriots.</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The haughty interloper, disturbing the peace of this once quiet town. Run for your life with\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong> and <strong>Shift.\u00a0</strong>Jump out of reach with\u00a0<strong>Space</strong>. Fire and aim with the\u00a0<strong>Mouse</strong>, and change weapons with\u00a0<strong>1</strong>,<strong> 2</strong>, and<strong> 3</strong>.\u00a0Ammo is limited, and appears less and less over time, so be careful with your shots. Oh, and do your best not to get cornered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to Raphael Gon\u00e7alves da Silva, Quaternius, and Arludus\u00a0for the readily-available models here on itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T09:39:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/079/0798c4d141e2f1660b64c488261b05bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sgtbrainiac"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
