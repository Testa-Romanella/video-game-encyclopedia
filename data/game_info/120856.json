The game is based on 'The President's Dog', episode 1 of 'Something True' podcast on the Idle Thumbs network. I was trying to make something similar to the 'Rhythm Heaven' series of games.</p>\n<p>Play as president Warren G. Harding's dog, Laddie Boy, and compose one of the letters he wrote to magazines and newspapers at the time of Harding's presidency.</p>\n<p>The game is only available for windows. It is controlled using two different inputs, as explained in the application itself. You can use either mouse or keyboard to play.<br/></p><p>Update (08-18-2017): In response to feedback from players I have added a timing indicator to make the input timing clearer. My thanks to everyone who played the game so far!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/943/943d86812773cdb6a2f1701794bf3696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teljoor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
