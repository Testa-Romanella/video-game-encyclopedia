Whether that means a lived-in kitchen space filled with sweets, or a tech-laden game room, the combinations are waiting to be explored. Dive into a world of boundless imagination and creativity with a treasure trove of thousands of items, each brimming with endless possibilities. Equipped with your very own room, this whimsical isometric room design game invites you to unleash your inner interior decorator.<h3>What Is It?</h3>Cozy Room Decorator is a casual room decorating game that offers players an opportunity to unleash their creativity. Gameplay is as simple as drag and drop what you want into the space. Players are given a room template that has a fixed isometric view, so two walls and a floor are the \u201cshell\u201d of the room. At game start up, players are given a catalog full of items to use in their rooms. There will be a variety of items to choose from so the player can decide what style of room they want. Some examples of items are bedroom furniture, kitchen appliances, and bathroom items. We\u2019ve also done away with item collision restrictions, so players can merge items together to create \u201cnew items\u201d. There is no overarching plot to the game, nor are there any side quests or prerequisites that may hinder one from decorating within gameplay. There is no in-game currency system that forces a player to \u201cbuy\u201d furniture for their rooms. The objective of Cozy Room Decorator is simply to decorate. This game is especially for those that want to put together an aesthetic room, but perhaps don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle and headache of learning a 3D modeling program. The integrated online community gallery will also help lend a hand in offering inspiration as players will be able to upload their rooms for others to view as well as download rooms for their own uses.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Cozy Features:</h3><ul><li>Decorate your room to show your unique style.<br/></li><li>Choose from thousands of items!<br/></li><li>Decorate Inside and Outside.<br/></li><li>Change the walls, floors or background of your room.<br/></li><li>Select from different lighting options, time of day or weather patterns.<br/></li><li>Pick different art options for different photo frames that you decorate with.<br/></li><li>Change the ambient noise sound effects to set the mood of your environment.<br/></li><li>Change the location of your room for a change of scenery!<br/></li><li>Upload Rooms to Community Gallery.<br/></li><li>Browse other player's rooms online to gain Inspiration.<br/></li><li>Backup and restore rooms from our online platform.<br/></li><li>Future versions of the game will have cross save enabled. <br/></li><li>Collision is disabled to allow merging items so players can be very creative!<br/></li><li>A sandbox game.
