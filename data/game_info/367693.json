You play as the hero pigeon protagonist and your goal is to find the bird house (hint: the platforms make a kind of pathway through the level).</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: left/right arrow keys to move, space to flap (hold to glide). You can also use a gamepad. Careful, your wings are only little so you get tired easy! I'm sure you'll recover pretty quickly, though, spritely young thing.</p>\n<p>Windows only for now :'(\u00a0The browser build is quite broken for no reason at all and I'm also having\u00a0difficulty in building for Mac, so\u00a0I think I'm going to abandon GameMaker and learn how to use Unity by remaking this game. So stay tuned, this will become playable on more platforms\u00a0eventually\u00a0but it might take me a while!</p>\n<p>Happy flapping.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a031b60c42c9c12aaffa40fe28c130a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jckcrll"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
