{"id": 106413, "slug": "hexaria", "name": "Hexaria", "name_original": "Hexaria", "description": "<p>Sink yourself in the world of Hexaria- an ambient puzzle game by the creator of Picross Pushers, inspired by Bejeweld and classic Japanese puzzle games as Panel de Pon and Meteos, as well as mobile indie game Sumico.</p><p>In Hexaria, you remove the gems from the field by including them into patterns, where the same order of gems appears multiple times in the same sequence. </p><p>Race against time in the Normal, Hard and Expert difficulties, prevent an ever-growing tower from reaching too high in Arise, be limited in your movements and plan in advance in Tunnel, or fight against a rain of meteors stacking to the top in Downpour. Not feeling like a challenge? In the Zen mode, you can make patterns on your own pace, while gaining self respect with over thirty mantras.</p><p>The game gains its ambient atmosphere with relaxing music, stunning backgrounds and minimal distractions. The game uses the GameJolt API to support online leaderboards for each mode, and gather interesting statistics. If you have a GameJolt account, you can log in to obtain trophies. Also included is a feature that makes the game playable for colorblind people. Hexaria currently supports the English and Dutch language.</p><p>Hexaria is open for improvements- clone and fork my code via GitHub or translate the game in your own language. You can reach me at @AmazingcookieNL or at amcookie.weebly.com. This Trello board contains the patch notes, as well as a press kit and other info about the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ce/5ce9de066794763b257440104611cdf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
