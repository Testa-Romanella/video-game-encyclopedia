You'll figure it out. The tutorial in level 1 should explain everything pretty well.\u00a0</p>\r\nJam Notes\r\n<p>You only miss good early 1900s jazz when it's gone...</p>\n<p>I was \"jazzed\" (lol can't fight the dad jokes) when I found out the theme for B&amp;W Jam is \"You only realize the value of something once it's gone.\" I had been chewing on ideas in the back of my head in relation to Jazz, so the theme got me thinking about historical Jazz. 1920s stuff.\u00a0A lot of the original Jazz artists have since passed away, and I hope that this game can inspire us to appreciate this wonderful genre of music and those who pioneered it, even if they're\u00a0gone.</p>\n<p>I'm submitting this game under\u00a0option A for the Jam\u00a0where I only use the actual colors black and white (no grays). Now for the sake of being honest, I made the artwork in Adobe Illustrator as vector images using exclusively the colors #000000 and #FFFFFF, but in order to export them as raster images\u00a0for use in my preferred game engine (Game Maker Studio 2) I\u00a0used hinted anti-aliasing to achieve smoother lines to look like the original true B&amp;W vector art (no jaggies!). The player will only see the two colors black and white, and based on what I've read in\u00a0the community threads, I believe this still works in the spirit of the Jam.</p>\n<p>Anyway, If you've read this far, thanks for sticking with me. I hope you enjoy the game!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game development, design, artwork: Jordan Ottesen (Me)</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: https://www.kenney.nl/,\u00a0https://tabletopaudio.com/, https://freesound.org/<br/></p>\n<p>Tools: GameMaker Studio 2, Adobe Illustrator, Reaper</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<strong>Level</strong><strong>Song</strong>1\"La Vei En Rose\" - Louis Armstrong (1901 - 1971)2\"It's Wonderful\" - Ella Fitzegerald (1917 - 1996)\u00a03\"Me, Myself, and I\" - Billy Holiday (1915 - 1956)<br/>4\"Sing Sing Sing\" - Benny Goodman (1909 - 1986)5\"Sugar Foot Stomp\" - Fletcher Henderson (1898 - 1952)<br/>6\"Dizzy Atmosphere\" - Dizzy Gillespie (1917 - 1993)7\"Topsy\" - Count Basie (1904 - 1984)8\"Little Willie Leaps\" - Miles Davis (1926 - 1991)9\"Salt Peanuts\" - Dizzy Gillespie (1917 - 1993)10\"Take Five\" - Dave Brubeck (1920 - 2012)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T12:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/937afd4a32ca9e3869733d21a9bb4beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jordan Ottesen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
