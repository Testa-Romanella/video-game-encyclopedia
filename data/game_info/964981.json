Controller distils the complexity of the role of a Tower Controller into an accessible light Simulation game. You\u2019ll make use of a simplified instruction system to quickly manage movements of planes around an Airfield. <br/><br/><br/>We'll start you off working a simple bush strip in the Australian outback. Despite the local farm animals getting the way you can quickly get promoted up to larger and busier Airports. Before long you'll find yourself handling aircraft in vast international airports from the UK to Japan.<br/><br/><br/>Clear runways for landing planes, hold for the 18:45 railway service that's cutting across your taxi-way, and keep out the of the way of a bad tempered Reindeer. Controller features 15 challenging and diverse levels that will put your planning skills to the test.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T03:36:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58f96e38bc84d7ac9cf1d2dfa4c212da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Crafts Bits"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Alex Crafts Bits"], "esrb_rating": null}
