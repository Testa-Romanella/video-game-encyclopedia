Through careful distance and precision timing, you can toast them to a golden brown perfection. Or just let them light, wave the sticks around and watch the world burn. Dual wield sticks for extra mallowness.</p><p>You can pick up the sticks with the trigger, and poke the marshmallow bag to get a new marshmallow. If you fling the stick quickly, the marshmallow will fly off.</p><p>Hold the marshmallow near the fire to roast it, bring the stick to your mouth to eat it and see how well roasted it is.</p><p>This is just a little test app to learn the basics of Unity with VR. It's pretty flakey, if the stick doesn't work, try the other controller or restart it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89cfbd8d4c7ead43803aea7b2d00d53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joeld42"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
