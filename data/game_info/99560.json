Or is it the same one?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA short 2P collaborative puzzle novel about interdependence where Side A player sees, Side B player listens, both players talk to solve riddles together. And no connection is required except for human verbal communication.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPrototyped with Ren'Py in &lt;48h for Global Game Jam 2015 (Milan, January 23-25) by We Are M\u00fcesli (Claudia Molinari &amp; Matteo Pozzi).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAdditional original music by Alessandro Coronas.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHOW TO PLAY | The game consists of two separate Ren'Py executables, \"Side A\" and \"Side B\", to be installed on two different laptops. Players are required to sit on opposite sides of a table, or not to see what's going on on the other screen anyway (so in principle it's ok to play it on opposite ends of a phone too).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t\"We'll Meet Again\" is played by staying in constant communication with the other player in front of you: Side A player is supposed to explain to the other one what (s)he's seeing on screen, Side B player is supposed to talk about what (s)he's listening in her/his headphones as reproduced by the different \"vinyls\" (s)he can choose from. Puzzles are conceived as mutual and interdependent: Side A hints are crucial for Side B choices and vice versa, so that both players have to carefully evaluate their possible answers before proceeding to the following level (or \"aura\"). Only by solving all the 5 auras correctly, a \"good ending\" will conclude this prototype version of the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb68dfe37dce02b0c062bdc5e5dadd0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["We Are M\u00fcesli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
