It's not a full game yet, but I plan on recreating it in Unity. I figured I'd upload the game here to get input from players in regards to how they like it, what they'd like to see, and how I can improve.<br/></p>\n<p>Any input is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>I am one of the primary developers for The\u00a0Ordinary Odyssey and my twitter is\u00a0https://twitter.com/LegenDerry9</p>\n<p>Most of the art was created specifically for this game by my friend Siddney. You can find his twitter here\u00a0https://twitter.com/SquiddneyD</p>\n\n<p><strong>!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>A small warning before you embark on your quest to complete your chores. This game wasn't entirely completed so in the \"Credits Menu\" there is no \"Back\" button or anything to get you out of that screen. The best way to over come this, is to just not go there! If you must check out the \"Credits Menu\" then you can get out of the game by closing it with task manager or by pressing the windows key and closing the game from the task bar.\u00a0This will be an issue I plan to correct in the future if I continue this game!</p>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66e54dd1f21d9e40d081ea0d323acc64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LegenDerry9"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
