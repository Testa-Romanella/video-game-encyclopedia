I\u00a0designed the characters and levels basing on our real stories in daily life. Feel free to play and experience our stories in the last 365 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is created for the individual, so it might be hard for common players in certain puzzle levels. In level 2, you need to jump and make the \"CALIX\" into the green to unlock the hidden door (it's a restaurant name), apart from this one I believe you will have fun in the rest of my game!
