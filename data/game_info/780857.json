No time to do really any custom graphics or anything, so its just a rather linear simple RM2K game. Two possible endings, and there are a couple choices you can make that may affect the ending you get, as well as the difficulty of the game. Be sure to examine things if you want to go for both endings.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T14:19:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/061/0612f84aa4480b612e41ec09633f191e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaptainJanitor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
