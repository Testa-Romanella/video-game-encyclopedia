Pair up with a friend, and help them make it across each challenge! Each mini-game has its modes, letting the duo pick what they are up against. We want people to get talking, with a fun challenge. The value behind our game is to get people to interact with each other. Other than that, we want people to see other perspectives. With the glasses, each player sees everything differently. The alternative value of the game is to have people see others' issues can be hidden behind different lenses.\u00a0</p><p>The game requires 3D Glasses to play. I recommend these ones.\u00a0https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XOPZ2RO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?i...\u00a0Buy two and pop out the lenses so you have one blue pair and one red pair.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T12:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d918d7cad20ddcdc6882241893bb50f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OIympus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
