Develop your strategy and take full control of Faction Island.Features<br/><br/><strong>Destructive Gameplay.</strong><br/><br/>Using the power of physics, every level features destructible scenery and buildings.  Set areas on fire, call in air-strikes and generally having fun blowing stuff up - but don't forget there are some real mission objectives to achieve, maybe stealth is the best option from time to time...<br/><br/><br/><strong>Combo System.</strong><br/><br/>Your combo resets to 1 every time you fire.  Take out as many baddies with a single shot to score the most points, taking advantage of the combo multiplier.  Use the destructible environments to your advantage and get the biggest combo you can.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Inter-faction Fighting.</strong><br/><br/>You have two enemy factions to contend with, the Natives and the Poachers.  Land a shot near an enemy and they will often blame the other faction and start fighting each other.  Incite the baddies to fight each other and save yourself the effort, as well as scoring more points and it all counts towards your combo.<br/><br/><br/><strong>8 Units to buy and upgrade to build a complete army.</strong><br/><br/><br/>Rifleman<br/><br/>The basic unit you start off with.  His slow shooting auto-rifle holds 5 bullets before needing to be reloaded.  Good movement ability and, as with all foot soldiers, can swing on vines.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Molotov Guy<br/><br/>Highly explosive and damaging, the Molotov Guy is a danger to everybody on the battlefield - use with caution, will set fire to pretty much everything.  On the plus side he does come equipped with fire-retardant armour.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sentry<br/><br/>Heavily armoured, but slow.  Carries a devastating Chain-gun that will make short work of basically anything, although it's accuracy is kinda poor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Spy<br/><br/>The ultimate in stealth.  This unit blends in until she gets too close to the enemy or gets seen attacking.  Really useful on rescue missions.  Her Ninja stars are great for attacking baddies from behind and destroying certain structures, however, they just bounce off barrels so don't expect explosive combos with this one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Flame Tank<br/><br/>Kinda rickety and easily damaged, but it's Flamethrower makes short work of most buildings and bad guys.  Set the world on fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tank<br/><br/>The toughest thing out there, although mobility is a little limited.  Also comes with a big, devastating gun firing big, explosive shells for maximum damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Helicopter<br/><br/>The ultimate in mobility, equipped with a devastating heavy machine gun.  Group a few of these up for unrivalled power on the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hovercraft<br/><br/>Glide over swamps, lava and water.  Armed with devastating rockets, but a narrow range of attack.<br/><br/><br/><strong>8 varying location of Faction Island, each with 3 missions to master</strong><br/><br/>Mercenary Camp<br/><br/>Your part of the island.  Protect it from the enemy!<br/><br/><br/>Oil Beach<br/><br/>Sums up why you are here - it's the natural resources!  You're drilling on Oil Beach and have a nice pipeline set up.  Defend the area from the Natives (who for some reason are not keen on our presence) and the Poachers.<br/><br/><br/>No Mans River<br/><br/>Fight along the river, just watch out for those cunning baddies hiding under water.<br/><br/><br/>Stompin' Swamp<br/><br/>That swamp isn't pleasant to be in, making everything except the Hovercraft slow to move.  Luckily there are lots of vines to swing on and get out of it.<br/><br/><br/>Sacred Volcano<br/><br/>This area is sacred to the Natives, they come here to worship their Idols, which of course, must be destroyed.<br/><br/><br/>Poacher's Camp<br/><br/>This is where the Poachers have set up camp.  Drive them out and we can make use of the new space.<br/><br/><br/>Native's Camp<br/><br/>These Natives are savage and in need of \"educating\".<br/><br/><br/>Coastline<br/><br/>We need to secure the coast if we are going to completely control the Island and you will need Helicopters and Hovercrafts to do it.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Varying Mission Types</strong><br/><br/>Secure the Area<br/><br/>Pretty straight-forward.  Just go in and destroy everything!<br/><br/><br/>Defend<br/><br/>You'll need to defend your base and oil wells.<br/><br/><br/>Destroy Objectives<br/><br/>Destroy the enemy Idols and Cages.<br/><br/><br/>Rescue Mission<br/><br/>The Natives and Poachers have kidnapped our Scientists and we need them alive!<br/><br/><br/>Solo Missions<br/><br/>Take in a single foot soldier - you might need to rescue some scientists or defend a drill.<br/><br/><br/>Sea Battles<br/><br/>Hovercraft or Helicopter only naval battle to secure the coast.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Replayability and Tactics</strong><br/><br/>Struggling with a mission?  You maybe just need the right troop or tactics.  Replay earlier missions and earn cash to expand your forces, giving you more options.<br/><br/>Often a tactical approach to a mission is required.  Select the correct units, scroll around and have a good look at the mission before you start.  And move slowly, thinking ahead.  This is all of course balanced with total destruction missions!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Steam Features</strong><br/><br/>High Scores and Best Times a for every mission.  As long as you don't die during the mission you will register a score and time - so on some missions the best tactic for a top score or time is to ignore the mission and just destroy everything as quickly as possible!<br/><br/>Achievements.  Can you unlock all the steam achievements?  Getting 3 stars on every level requires some genuine skill!<br/><br/>Cloud Saves.
