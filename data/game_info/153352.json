You play the role of a \r\ndisgruntled office worker. Years and years in the same boring office, \r\nwith the same boring jokes and the same paperwork. You feel your mind \r\nslowly dying. What are you doing it all for? Is this all there is to \r\nlife?</p><p>And suddenly you snap. This is not how it's going to end.</p><p>And that's how it starts...</p><p>Let loose, you try to escape from the office, using whatever weapons you\r\n find - which means constructing Molotov cocktails from whiskey bottles \r\nand robbing the art department of their spray cans for some \r\nredecorating. Along the way you'll get confronted by police, bankers, \r\nand finally maybe even save the world - or fail miserably?<br/><br/>You can even take a break from the action to watch the people in the world talk or think, and read a few books.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fcef6df8a5d4c1694bb801f477b21a98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elvirais"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
