When the trainee come back, he will learn a random battle skill.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    During the first time of game, Player can only choose Zhao Yun as protagonist. But when you pass the game and restart a new trip, you can use the item \"Reward Of Finding Officer\" to choose a random officer among more than three hundred officers in Sanguo's history. There are 38 cities(such as Xu Chang) and more than fifty villages(such as Chang Shan) which you can explorer. You can reinforce your troop by attacking bandits and adventure in Sanguo's world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    There are hundreds of events for the players to enjoy. For instance, if you get a ancient treasure map, you can use compass to guide you to the location of treasures, and use shovel to dig. The Adventures in the world are limited by Food of your troop. If all the Food are consumed, then game over. So the player must pay attention to the Food of Troop from time to time. Moreover, the Food price are different from time to time, you can use this to make money. The expedition could also decrease the MP(morale) of the troop, which will effect the battle process.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    When the player's troop are strong enough, attacking cities should be considered. Which city to conquer first? If the player attack the capital of Wei dynasty at the very beginning, the game will be over soon.

The larger the city scale is, the more harvest you can obtain.<br/>\r\nIf a lord has many cities(such as Cao Cao), you must conquer all his cities before recruiting his officers. For instance, Lord Yuan Shao has two cities, Ping Yuan and Nan Pi. You can only recruit Yuan Shao's officers when you conquer all these two cities.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    The three properties, Kindheartedness, Wisdom and Courage, are very important when you recruit officers.

Some officer with great ability values but without a good ultimate skill, you can use Skill Scroll to let him learn new skills, then he will be powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    Except some top Weapons and Armors are unbreakable, all other equips have durability value, and the equip will be broken  when its durability decrease to 0 during battle. You can use Colored Stone to fix it, which is sold in Item Store.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n   The Type of corps is also very important for battle. If a general equip a well known Units such as \"Tiger Fighters\" or \"Wu Dang Armored Vehicle\", then he <br/>\r\nwill have a huge advantage compared with other generals with ordinary Units during battle. Attack bandits in the big map will have chance to capture their special Units.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n    You are not recommended to explore the suburb of villages or cities, enemies there are too strong. But if you are determined to do it, you can get Skill Scrolls or Equips, and other pleasant surprise.
