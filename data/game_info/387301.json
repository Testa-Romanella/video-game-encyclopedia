You play as Vuinten, a hero who's been thrown into the games because he murdered a religious leader. As you fight your way through the games, trying to defend yourself and expose the evil Alt religion for what it is, you'll be able to unlock numerous armors, bullets, aimers, and slashes. <br/><strong>What will be Free and what will be Premium?</strong><br/><br/>The entire game is free to play. The only thing that costs any real money are items in the store marked as premium. However, there are loads of items that can be unlocked using in game points. And when new updates are released, including more levels, bosses, armors, etc, the game itself will still be free to play. You won't have to pay to unlock the extra stages, just the premium items. <br/><br/><strong>Will there ever be multiplayer?</strong><br/><br/>While we'd love to incorporate a variety of multiplayer options, we can't say for certain when, or if, it'll be released. <br/><strong>Why did you pick a stupid name like Vuinten for the main character?</strong><br/><br/>Why does it matter? We chose it because we liked it. <br/><br/><strong>I don't. </strong><br/><br/>Okay...next question?<br/><br/><strong>Are you ever going to apologize for how bad Volkstein was?</strong><br/><br/>No. Next question. <br/><br/><strong>Why are there pigs and other weird things in the audience seats?</strong><br/><br/>Because it's on a different planet. <br/><br/><strong>A planet with pigs? That's realistic.</strong><br/><br/>It's a video game. It's very nature is to not be realistic. <br/><br/><strong>Well, yeah, with these graphics. </strong><br/><br/>I'm done with this interview. And when the hell did this turn into an interview?<br/><br/><strong>Around your 4th cup of wine.</strong><br/><br/>Oh.
