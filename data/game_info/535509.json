This is a new experience that is educational that helps you learn about STEM and working different challenges to solve puzzles. When completing levels, it fills you with satisfaction and joy that you solved a tough problem, like in an escape room. The thing about escape rooms is that it is fun to problem solve through. With current Covid-19 restrictions, it is hard or near impossible to go to an escape room to have some fun with your brain, now this brings the experience to your home! Also, our game does not require extensive outside knowledge, and any troubles can be discussed with your parents or family members. This game is a good starting launchpad for people interested in STEM.
