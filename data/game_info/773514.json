I have made the music, the assets, all the scripts etc. by myself. The map will get bigger, there will be new puzzles, and overall more stuff in later updates! \u00a0Quick note\u00a0if u press R in the game, it respawns you in the respawn point, and will reset the place of boxes, and exiting game in the middle through gameplay can be done by pressing esc. I would be really thankful to receive feedback, so I could work more efficiently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12caad8b878cdf26d9f90a07911e571b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dev0Berg"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
