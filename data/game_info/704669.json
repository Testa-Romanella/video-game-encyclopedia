The game is over when your trust points drop to zero, so audit your prescriptions carefully and quickly!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-09T21:23:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfc/bfc25e9de461901a25dbebe6e0e75445.jpg", "website": "https://www.medicanblog.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u85ac\u5b66\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u85ac\u5b66\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8"], "esrb_rating": null}
