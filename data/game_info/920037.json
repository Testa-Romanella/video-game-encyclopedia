The theme is \"roots\", and our game is based on a root event in which the protagonist goes under a series of misfortunate events based on one little silly occurence. The game follows a short story, and each level is a minigame you have to complete to progress. Everytime a minigame starts, you are presented with a instruction on what you're supposed to do. The gameplay is very inspired by the WarioWare series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:29:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10efeb1542ec78483e55d596aceeb19e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RodrigoZea"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
