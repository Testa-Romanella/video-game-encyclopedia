The students first learned about the format of interactive fiction, then they worked in small groups to write possible endings to the provided \"Crash &amp; Code\" prequel story (both are found here). Finally, they learned introductory skills for coding paths and passages in Twine to create their own stories.\u00a0 Here are their stories!</p><p>Click below to download the individual stories, and then double click on the files to play them in your browser. Please be sure to come back and read through all the stories, and be sure to \"follow\" us to see what new interactive fiction is created at our library!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c6a8a541c61ace197627f487c65c7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Macedon Public Library"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
