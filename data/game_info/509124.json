(check out my website, there's a list of planned features there https://www.crazy-dog.fi/en/pelit/)<br/><br/>This game isn't supposed to be any kind of so-called \"disclosure\" project, that's why there are humoristic elements in the game, it's an ongoing art project designed to arouse curiosity in people.<br/><br/><strong>Main features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Get a job in Area 15</li><li>Rob a pharmacy and sell drugs to aliens</li><li>Fly a flying saucer</li><li>Buy a car</li><li>Unlock new features and proceed in the story by shooting baskets at Area 15</li></ul>\n<p>The aim is to release an update with new features to gameplay every 2 months, bug fixes and small detail updates may occur more often.<br/>All the main systems have been integrated, so I can now focus on building the story and sometimes make the game mechanics a little better.<br/><br/>Before this game comes out of Early Access the buildings and overall world design will be more detailed, the game mechanics will be fine-tuned and any known bugs will be fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d5b62a61017f76dd6db50f151f5063f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazy Dog Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
