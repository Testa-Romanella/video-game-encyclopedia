You have been warned. I want to work on the accessibility but don't have time in the jam sorry :[. However, if you're up for a challenge, stick around!</p>\n<p>Install and starting play: Download the zip file, unzip it somewhere and you're all good to start playing. MazeLock.txt is your helper file, and you don't need to reload the game every time you make an edit. Just make sure you save. There will be a copy just in case you mess up as the file is EXTREMELY sensitive to new lines being added/deleted and the game will be unplayable. Any other edits (you will need to edit) will be fine. Just avoid the enter key for now :P\u00a0. Should you mess up, copy the contents of the copy into MazeLock.txt.</p>\n\n<p>There is a CheatSheet. There is a disclaimer at the top of the file, but I'll put one here too. It is for the sole purpose of cheating. If you are really REALLY stuck, use the cheat sheet.</p>\n<p>WASD to move around and a keyboard to edit MazeLock.txt. And that's it!</p>\n<p>GLHF!</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>When you go to a new room, you can very easily go back into the room before and possibly get stuck. When you walk through a door, commit all the way to avoid this.
