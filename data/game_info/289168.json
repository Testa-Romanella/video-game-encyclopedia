When a player hits a ball, they gain control of it, and that ball can only hurt their opponent. If a single player gains control of all 3 balls, they enter BLACKOUT and their opponent can't defend themselves for a few seconds. When BLACKOUT ends, control of the balls reset. The round continues until one player gets hit by an opponent's ball 5 times.</p>\n<p>Note: This requires 2 local players, and each player must have a controller. It uses Rewired for Unity, which supports most controllers.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (XBOX 360):</strong><br/>Move and Aim: Left Stick<br/>Jump and Double Jump: A<br/>Attack: X / B</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd180d20ce83c061bb8636f0c657814d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ironpencil"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
