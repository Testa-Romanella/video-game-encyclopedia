This is the reason that humans and animals play, to practice critical life\r\nskills in a safe environment. If the definition of intelligence is the ability to get what one wants, few skills make one\r\nmore intelligent than that of strategic thinking. As a conduit to developing a keen mind for strategy chess has existed\r\nas a fundamental form of play for hundreds of years.\r\n</p>\n<p>Opening theory is the name given to the traditional sequences of starting moves that define all chess games at the\r\nhigher levels of play. This field of study has advanced to the point where master players commit entire trees of\r\ncontingencies to memory before the start of a game, with the title going to the one more willing to cram their mind full\r\nof minutia. Rote memorization is arguably the least useful skill one might acquire, in an age when any fact can be\r\nlooked up almost instantly online.\r\n</p>\n<p>Chess died when it transitioned from imparting life\u2019s most useful skill to its least useful one.\r\n</p>\n<p>Enthusiasts of the game will resonate with this dismal state of affairs, but fortunately for them we have good news.\r\nThe developers at Bahlsenwitz LLC have Lazarus-like breathed new life into the empty husk of this once proud game,\r\ntheir creation is called <em>tschess</em> and is available now in the App Store and Play Store alike.\r\n</p>\n<p>Aware of the deficiencies of traditional chess Bobby Fischer the American grandmaster and 1972 World Champion\r\nbegan working on a means of salvaging the most compelling elements of the game. Known as Fischer random\r\nchess, or Chess960, this game uses the same board and pieces as traditional chess, however the initial configuration\r\nof the pieces on the players' own back rank is randomized. While the random setups eliminate the ploy of advantage\r\ngained through rote memorization, it is at odds with the notion that human action is consequential.\r\n</p>\n<p>The creators of tschess adhere to the Thielian concept that \u201c<em>you are not a lottery ticket</em>\u201d, that randomness is not the\r\ndefining characteristic of life. In tschess, rather than beginning the game with an assortment of random pieces the\r\nplayers can premeditate the disposition of pieces on the back two ranks. Taking pawns to be worth one point, bishops\r\nand knights to be worth three, rooks to be worth five, and queens to be worth nine, a standard board has a total value\r\nof 39. With that as an upper bound, tschess players can organize their back two ranks however they see fit, this could\r\nmean for instance, four queens and one knight, or all bishops (leaving two of the squares empty), or anything in\r\nbetween!\r\n</p>\n<p>The resulting game is faster paced, having dispensed with the courtship seque of well known openings, we can get\r\nimmediately to the action, as both players begin by seeking to execute their premeditated plan, while coping with the\r\nsurprising new disposition of their opponent.\r\n</p>\n<p>As humans we\u2019re resistant to change, we hold an undue reverence for the things of the past. The original creators of\r\nchess weren\u2019t gods, they were human like you and I, while it\u2019s true that they had many admirable traits they were\r\nlikewise subject to the same foibles that we experience in our daily lives. To refrain from adapting their creation to\r\nbetter suit the circumstances of today is a disgrace to their legacy and the spirit out of which chess was born. Chess\r\nis dead. Long live tschess.\r\n</p>\n<p>That said, we encourage you not to take our word for it. Try it out for yourself! Available on Android and iOS.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T03:34:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8fece90078d4712ff5d5b3808610b4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bahlsenwitz"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
