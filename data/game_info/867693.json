TGSET 1 IS AVAILABLE ON ITCH.IO ONLY SINCE ITS LIKELY NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ACCEPTED HERE.</p>\n<p>WARNING 3, THERE ARE FLASHING LIGHTS IN PARTS OF THIS GAME, THERES ALSO ALOT OF VULGAR LANGUAGE AND LOUD DUMB NOISES SOMETIMES.)</p>\n<p>SUMMARY:</p>\n<p>TGSET 2 is a slightly more Grezzo 2/Postal 2 inspired sequel to an RPGMXP Game made by some jackass with too much free time on the summer and a trial of RPGMXP. TGSET 1 was a bit lacking and this sequel aims to keep and ramp up the stupidity of its predecessor while also bringing an assload of more stuff.</p>\n<p>The Guy is back again to deliver an ass kicking of astronomical proportions!</p>\n<p>After going through hell, heaven and back in TGSET 1 he got jailed for something he did.</p>\n<p>Now everyone loves cereal, especially The Guy so he decides to escape prison and get some cereal to go along with his milk.</p>\n<p>With a new prisoner friend by his side, The Guy will have to fight his way through the bullshit of the town i couldnt be bothered with naming.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<p>- A variety of music and asstets stolen from different sources</p>\n<p>- Stupidly overpowered weapons at parts</p>\n<p>- 2 Paths filled with the most unexpectedably (or however you spell it) dumb shit you can imagine</p>\n<p>- Plenty of various enemies</p>\n<p>- The ability to piss in battle and outside of battle. this is my favorite feature.</p>\n<p>- Possibly some \"so bad its good\" value.</p>\n<p>If you like total stupidity and crudely vulgar \"humor\" with a little bit of hell and abstractness (is that even a word? not sure), this game is for you. if not, you should probably still play it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A DLC is planned for the game (dont worry, it will be free) to expand on the strange world of the town with no name, so look out for that.</p>\n<p>!!!IF\u00a0 YOU PLAYED THIS, PLEASE LEAVE FEEDBACK! I LOVE SEEING FEEDBACK WHETEVER POSITIVE OR NOT :)!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:26:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b8c6cbe64be6f833026bd8508675b80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vetticon"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
