Pull switches, collect flashlights and run from demons in an unsettling world that exists between reality, your nightmares and your OS.<br/><br/><strong>So, you want to escape from the control of your keepers?</strong> Maybe the inspections have been getting a little \"too much\" for you, or you wonder if you'll ever stop scratching the day counts into the wall/wrist? It ain't so simple, I'm afraid, since you are unable to function in the \"real world\" and you've been sedated for so long it is impossible to tell what is real and what is fantasy.<br/><br/><strong>Well, let's break it down:</strong> when you are scratched, the scratch doesn't hurt, but you interpret it as pain, yes? So is this world, reality on the outside but the horrors of the world on the inside... or is it? Maybe all of those sedatives actually made you pass into the \"other world\" where there really isn't any escape?<br/><br/><strong>Fortunately for you, the player can always reset the game</strong>, and maybe you'll be safe... or be trapped forever until the next update?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T06:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85dbb0c10288eeb9359c5d42bc7ee6c8.jpg", "website": "http://www.spyonthewall.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spy On The Wall"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spy On The Wall"], "esrb_rating": null}
