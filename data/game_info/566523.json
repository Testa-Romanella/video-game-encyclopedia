Danger, intrigue and cosmic adventure await you- but first you'll need to pass your basic piloting exam.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUntil they can trust you with their multi-trillion credit spacecraft, you'll need to prove yourself in this T71 Kestral, a rather care-worn training craft whose only weapon shoots ping pong balls. Yes, it's a tad under-powered but the T71 more than makes up for this with rustic charm. You'll love it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter the \"incident\" during an earlier attempt, Squadron officials have set up a series of driving test courses in a seemingly harmless derelict space freighter. What could go wrong? Naturally, it would be decidedly non-ideal for you to run into hostile life forms. We ran a scan and are 90% sure-ish that you won't see any. If you do, maybe you can find a way to dispatch them passively. You'll figure it out- or maybe you won't. How exciting!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nZip around through fifteen exciting levels over 5 separate environoments in your quest for the Star Squadron Pilot's License.<br/>\r\nFind the hidden tokens in each stage to open up later courses. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne request: please do try not to die. It results in a lot of cumbersome admin and could result in damage to the T71. Also, your demise would go down on your permanent record, so yeah, try to avoid dying.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T03:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08c/08cca116590695e47a70affaee0d25bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mark Arenz"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mark Arenz"], "esrb_rating": null}
