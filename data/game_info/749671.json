Match three or more blocks of the same color horizontally and/or vertically to score a combo. Score large combos to attack enemies with elemental damage based on the color of the first combo scored that turn. You have a limited amount of time to make as many swaps as wanted.</p>\n<p>The \"Push\" command will push up new blocks onto the playing field from the bottom of the screen. Blocks can be pushed safely outside of the playing field without risking defeat. More blocks mean more chances for bigger combos and longer chains.</p>\n<p>The player will be defeated if blocks are stacked outside of the playing field at the end of a turn when using the \"Swap\" battle command. Metal junk blocks cannot be matched but will automatically disappear if adjacent to a color combo when scored.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Contributors<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Slyonics</li><li>Noyemi K</li><li>Mox-e</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Assets By<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Personified UX Regular</em><strong> </strong>font by pluffaduff</li><li><em>Silkscreen Extended</em> font by Jason Kottke</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:05:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd7e3ff77c7cf3a0d378025bdb85715d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noyemi K", "Slyonics", "Mox-e"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
