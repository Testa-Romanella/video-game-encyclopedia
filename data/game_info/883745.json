It turns out that it's quite hard to concentrate on two characters at once (WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN?! :), and as such I had to limit myself at what I throw at the player, as it would have been too frustrating otherwise.</p>\n<p>Another problem was that one simply does not have three hands, so aiming is basically out of the question. But you had to shoot something, somehow... So I came up with the idea that the two characters control a beam together, which is <em>steered</em> by moving either of the player. As such, it is relatively responsive, and one still has to concentrate on both players. <br/></p>\n<p>Another interesting aspect would be to play the game with two players. This would shift the entire difficulty, as now the controls are quite easy, but there are a lot of annoyances when trying to aim the laser correctly. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T10:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e66014308aa3810f9f98a6c74527b26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wolffrog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
