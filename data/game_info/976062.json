Think on your feet while you follow your leads : ask questions to witnesses, detect their lies, hypothesize why and finally confront the silent ones running from their past.<h3>A strange request</h3>You are entrusted with the peculiar case of Victor Dousvalon. This old history professor is known for shrouding his past life in secrecy for everyone around, including his own daughter Catherine. But an apparently harmless accident decides him to hire you to help Catherine trace back the steps of his life.<br/><br/>Why does he not simply tell himself his own story\u00a0?<br/><br/>Why does Catherine, who has been so distant with her father these past years, suddenly wants to know\u00a0about him? <br/><br/>Your first case will decidedly be a delicate one...<h3>Anything goes to break the silence!</h3>Get engrossed in the handy work of a detective : search through family papers, ask personal questions, call at inopportune times and be generally nosy.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Head First Investigation</h3>No watching characters think for you, this is your time to prove your deductive powers. Choose leads, follow them to the end or stop when you think you\u2019ve got the right idea. But you'll need to be convincing to push the silent ones to talk!<br/><br/><br/><h3>People\u2019s History</h3>Piece together the lives, the choices and the tragedies people are running from and walk a mile in their shoes.<br/>Discover History, not from a bird\u2019s eye view, but from the ground, where folk have to continue living and coping, each in their own unique way.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:50:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16f/16f4eed87d243131ffb5dd1de7b19b67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pierre Feuille Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pierre Feuille Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
