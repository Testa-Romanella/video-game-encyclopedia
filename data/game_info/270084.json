Click and drag Squidude through obstacles and randomly triggered events to hit cool energy points and save the world.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype for a randomly generated point and drag adventure game. There are several ideas not utilized in this limited engine and time. Although this is a PC game, it was built with mobile apps in mind. In the future, I'd like to use touch controls for the mouse. Better story, graphics, custom characters, and a much more diverse set of enemies/levels are in mind for a future project.<br/></p>\n<p>Some sound effects from\u00a0Juhani Junkala are utilized with permission.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83d/83dcdfdca509a6e8f8e4c51be889d671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RAMADORG"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
