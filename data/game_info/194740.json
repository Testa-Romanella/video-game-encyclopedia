The game is simple.  Use the mouse (or your finger, if using a mobile device to play) to guide a colored circle around the screen.  Collect like colored shapes as they fall, but be sure to avoid different colored shapes!</p><p>The game was made using Libgdx and Box2d.  I had some issues with Box2d and Sunday afternoon I had to pivot my plans a bit in order to finish something for the jam!  Unfortunately I was unable to create any sound for this game this time around.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab6cb821bbe609828a3ecb5fc754aea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lonewookie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
