But be warned - the fupacabra is hungry.\u00a0Every time you pick up an ingredient the fupacabra will <strong><em>sense your location</em></strong>. Sometimes as you wonder the forest, you may experience a \"fupaflash\" - meaning that the beast has also sensed your location.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If she sees you, she'll chase you - but don't fret, sprint away and after a while, the fupacabra will lose interest.\u00a0Get too close however... <strong><em>and you'll be eating fupa for a week</em></strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So tread carefully, and most importantly - feed the fupacabra!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Controls : WASD and shift to sprint.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T14:08:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b66e9175cd06fa096e97f7d2b8efd35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KJ Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
