Experiment E.C.H.O has escaped and is running loose. The lab has gone into shutdown mode, and <em>it's dark...</em></p>\n<p>It's Dark is a 4-player horror game with a 3-Scientist vs 1-Monster mechanic. Players join a room with 3 other players, stating their player character preferences. When the game starts, all players are transported into a procedurally generated map (different each game) where the goal is to kill or be killed!</p>\n<p>Scientists must find items around the map (guns, first aid kits, and keycards) while the monster lurks around, hunting them. Scientists can activate the gas nexus terminals with the keycards to prevent the monster's health regeneration, allowing easier ability to kill them. However, they must be careful not to shoot their friends at the same time.<br/>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>This game was made by a team of 5.
