Watch it here, and drop me a subscribe, since this is my first video!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>----------------------------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trust no one.</strong></p>\n<p>Play as the leader of a shadowy witch clan, and hunt out dark elements that are arising in the coven using your special light powers. In this game, you can't trust any witch but yourself... and maybe not even that.</p>\n<p>This game was solo-developed in 72 hours for the BenBonk Game Jam 2020. This was my first game jam! I may make a \"making of\" video, stay posted for that.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Illumination: Right Click</p>\n<p>Magic Missiles: Left Click</p>\n<p>Restart Level: R</p>\n<p>Restart Game: Q</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to the following creators for their assets.
