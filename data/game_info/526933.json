{"id": 526933, "slug": "soar-comicsansdan", "name": "Soar (comicsansdan)", "name_original": "Soar (comicsansdan)", "description": "<p>Soar is a platforming/adventure game where the main goal is to get out of a pit you\u2019re stuck in. At the start of the game, the player will be faced with platforming challenges to get out of the pit. Luckily, the player is equipped with abilities that will help get passed the obstacles (i.e. dash). As the player gets more skilled with the abilities, the challenges will become more difficult and certain obstacles can only be completed with the help of certain abilities. Note that this is a prototype of the concept and you can reset back to the title at anytime by pressing [R].</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c87/c87d06d7de7a51c7aa129a042c8ccc81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["comicsansdan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
