Unbeknownst to most people on Business Planet, the beginning of the end has arrived. Those of whom who had prepared for this day were also those who caused it. At the center of it all is one, recently fired, CEO. The CEO of the terminated Suits City. When a city is recycled it is meant to be placed under total quarantine, fumigation and extermination. The Shareholders of Business Planet, framers of the Declaration of Businependence, outlined this process in Addendum One: Redaction. However, in the world of business, employees are only as reliable as they are built to be, and the CEO is now a wanted fugitive. His crime, survival. The Shareholders aren't happy and they plan on finishing the job themselves. Your only hope for survival is to befriend the enemy of thine enemy and prepare the offensive. Take them out before they come for you, and stop the Shareholders from obtaining Absolute Power, lest they destroy anything and everything you've ever known. Or, perhaps, you will fall to the poisonous temptations of corruption before you have the opportunity to exact your vengeance on the world that created you and the world that seeks to destroy you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Suits: Absolute Power uses a Popsicle-Puppet, Sketch-Art style turn-based combat system. With features such as, party members, special attacks, enchanted relics, consumable stimulants, uniform-style armor system and a wide array of \"Strictly-Professional\" briefcases wielding immense power. Introducing a new \"Corruption-Mode\" mechanic, with unique character transformations that change your set of attacks to deal immense damage at the low, low price of your eternal and immortal soul :)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T04:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/19879c993e0856c49701f9a9d8567df9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 26}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 52, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Technomancy Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Technomancy Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
