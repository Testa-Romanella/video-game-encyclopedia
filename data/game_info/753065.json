You must find the Orb and bring it back to the entrance with your sanity intact. You may want to pick up some extra gems along the way.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, the Temple is full of Slithering Things. Seeing them too closely will damage your sanity, but silhouettes are ok. They can also see you and your silhouette, and can hear noises like running, doors creaking, and gunshots. (Three are three kinds of Things, and three description sets which are assigned at random for each game.)<br/><br/>This is a short single level game, and probably very unbalanced.</p>\n<p>Field of view is shown with a grey background, and is sensitive to light levels. In a dark room you may be able to see the area around a lamp on the far wall, but not the floor between you and the lamp. A stronger grey background on a monster indicates that you are seeing it in silhouette.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:54:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9004d2fee5b3c60ffff368fe2be820.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["theq629"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
