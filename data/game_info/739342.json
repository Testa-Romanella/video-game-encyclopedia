This game is somewhere between prototype and alpha in terms of development. Most of the art is placeholder, some of it created by me, some of it found on the Internet. There is currently no sound. The rewind mechanic is in active development and is subject to change. There are only 3 levels with the first two introducing how to play and the third just a left over from earlier development. The menu is jank but I needed something. There is a bug in the menu after using the fullscreen button that requires clicking buttons twice afterward to activate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>space - jump</p>\n<p>left-shift - use power (limited by \"mana\")</p>\n<p>y - rewind (press and hold)</p>\n<p>r - restart level</p>\n<p>esc - return to menu</p>\n\n<p>I'd really love your feedback about the game but please try to keep it constructive. I know it has a long way to go. Some things I'm still figuring out: rewind and how it will be used, size - currently everything feels too small, different or additional powers.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time!</p>\n<p>Stephan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T09:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6e94d5c8e7e21cd7c9c2fbc29686ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["srcleaves"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
