This game is our first completed project, but we think it came out pretty well. Help VI (Six) escape the casino as poker chips and evil dice (VIVIVI/SixSixSix) stand in your way. Be quick or the casino will catch up to you. One hit and you're dead, so be careful as you plan your next move. A couple of small changes were made after the gamejam just to make it more presentable (maybe 5 hours of work).</p>\n<p>Some notes (Important):\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Womp chips (the big ones) will telegraph when they plan on collapsing. Make sure to be out of the way!\r\n</li><li>You can step on a tile\u00a0where a coin is about to leave\u00a0to avoid being hit by them.\r\n</li><li>Abilities are selected by using the J, K, L, and ; keys. After selecting an ability J, K, L, and ; are used to select the dice you would like to use for that ability. Also, once an ability is selected W, A, S, and D can be used to choose a direction. Escape/Backspace (Escape will exit fullscreen mode) will cancel dice choices and ability selections. Once you are confident in your selection press enter to use the ability.\r\n</li><li>Some abilities will only accept certain dice combinations or will result in different effects depending on your choice of dice.\r\n</li><li>Selecting an ability causes a tooltip to show up at the top of the screen providing more information on its functionality.\r\n</li><li>Since the theme is Roll of the Dice, if you move while already having 4 dice you run the risk of losing a die you would have rather kept.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917cb4e9b98d38bc82b2f48ef4bd7776.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Michael.Feist"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
