Includes 3 mini-games featuring \"sound\" focused gameplay!</strong><br/><br/>This party game is designed with visual impairments in mind as it relies strongly on sound. <br/>There are three mini-games, each focusing on a different challenge. <br/>You will need a set of external speakers to play.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is available in English, Japanese and Chinese.<br/><br/><h3>Three mini-games</h3><h3>GIRIGIRI HARVEST: Pay close attention to each sound as you compete for the highest score!</h3>Pulling turnips from the field will earn you points, however some of the turnips are actually Screaming Mandrakes. <br/>Different Mandrakes have different sounds. <br/>If you hear the same Mandrake scream three times, you will score zero points for the round. <br/>Players should listen closely to each other and keep moving forward until the very last minute to collect more points! <br/>It's a simple but surprisingly exciting game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>BURUBURU SHELL: Work together to choose the same themed sound!</h3>According to the question, choose a sound that you think is easy to convey, such \u201csounds like\u2026\u201d, or \u201cfeels like\u2026\u201d. <br/>If the other player can then guess the same sound, the stage is cleared! <br/>Work together to get all the questions right!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>DOKIDOKI SUBMARINE: Avoid obstacles, find enemies, fire torpedoes! </h3>Players are divided into two roles: A \"Sonar player\" who uses sound to search for enemies and obstacles, and a \"Pilot player\" who steers the submarine and fires/detonates torpedoes. <br/>Work together to clear the stage. <br/>The Sonar player puts a speaker to his or her ear and tells the pilot the location of an enemy or obstacle. <br/>Using information from the Sonar player, the Pilot fires a torpedo and detonates it directly over the enemy!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T02:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/4120580713d50d4c3e143655dae77b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GIFT TEN INDUSTRY K.K."], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["GIFT TEN INDUSTRY K.K."], "esrb_rating": null}
