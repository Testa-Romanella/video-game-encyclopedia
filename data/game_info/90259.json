And boy are you ready to meet their demands.\u00a0<br/><br/>With a single pull of a lever you can supply more than enough pieces of metal, rubber and explosives to satisfy their heart's desires and more. It's so simple! Listen closely to every little masked guy and put out the goods they order. Just don't take too long or they will get grumpy.<br/><br/>PS. The Resupply Machine seems to arm some of the explosives immediately after dispensing, so you'll have to figure something out. Try selling them quick maybe? Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/6294857bdfb68d814d17c6da31829845.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["auxiliaryCarry", "Tommy", "chrissx2", "Veka"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
