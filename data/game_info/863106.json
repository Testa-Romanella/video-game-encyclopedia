Like... We made it weird <em>ON PURPOSE</em>. Why? ...Why not! It's a game made for the Ludum Dare 51. No justification needed.</p>\r\nEPIC MANAGEMENT\r\n<p>You are <strong>managing a segway racing competition</strong> <em>(yeah yeah we know, once again a game about segways)</em>. However, <strong>every 10 seconds</strong> something <strong>really bad</strong> <em>(well it's subjective)</em> happens. It ranges from boredom to any kind of simplified apocalypse. And you have to <strong>take decisions</strong> before it happens <strong>to survive</strong>. Of course, these decisions are often absurd and weird. Good luck.</p>\n<p>How does it work? You have 5 gauges : <strong>Unfairness</strong>, <strong>Audience</strong>, <strong>Obedience</strong>, <strong>???</strong>, <strong>Profit</strong>. If any gauge is empty right after a cataclysm... It's a gameover. That's it.</p>\r\nQUICK DECISION MAKING\r\n<p>Okay so basically this is a game about making <strong>quick decisions</strong> and <strong>living with the consequences</strong>. Oh the game won't always tell you the consequences. At least... not explicitely. Be fast, be lucky, and everything should be alright. Or take your time.\u00a0It may be the key to surviving. Who knows?<br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS: CLICK\r\n<p>Click on things to do things. That's it.</p>\r\nI DUNNO WHAT TO SAY\r\n<p>The game is weird, absurd and that's it.\u00a0We had a lot of fun making it. Oh my... It was so fun!</p>\r\nWHATEVER\r\n<p>See ya!</p>\n\r\nUAO?P UAO?P UAO?P UAO?P UAO?P\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>UI DESIGN / AUDIO / VFX\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Thomas Lebrun</em>\u00a0(Raivk)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Anatole Chaumont\u00a0</em>(CharlieTU)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER</strong>\u00a0:\u00a0<em>Jean-Christophe Joubier</em>\u00a0(eFrag)</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER</strong>\u00a0: <em>Julia Marinelli</em>\u00a0(Donhadryel)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>3D ART\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0<em>Lea Pequignot</em>\u00a0(Silveria)</p>\n\n<p><strong>I'M A USELESS PIECE OF TEXT!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3957a8a24de61847e81b545c230a7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Teagher Studio", "eFrag", "Raivk", "CharlieTU", "JuliaMarinelli"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
