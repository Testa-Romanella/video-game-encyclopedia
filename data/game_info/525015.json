You fly thru space and escape enemy spaceships that are attacking you. The only thing that you can do is shoot them with your onboard laser and fly forward, but they are coming fast. Test your skills and aim in Spectre. Press W to fly forward, and use the left mouse button to fire your laser. You can also click the space bar to fly forward instantly, at the cost of 5 score points. If you think that your player is looking around too fast or slow, you can adjust the slider under sensitivity in the Settings menu, which can be accessed via the Main Menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2ce4a696b999b97bd5a9a4fb398ffde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Et-17"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
