It features turn-based movement, a simple attacking and combat system, procedurally generated levels and a host of items to find. Despite it's traditional roots, RogueBlood attempts to modernize many things about traditional roguelikes. Inventory management is done through an interface of item slots which can be easily manipulated, and in general the need for memorization of hotkeys has been purposely reduced (although some hotkeys are still present).</p>\n<p>Basic Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Enter to progress through text</p>\n<p>Move into chests and doors\u00a0to open them</p>\n<p>Move into enemies to attack with the currently equipped weapon</p>\n<p>Click on enemies with a ranged weapon to attack</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Pixel Fonts:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/pixel-fonts-megapack-65958</p>\n<p>Artist:\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/eldigart</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T07:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a56/a560bc33c52301da001b53cd2a8212b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hamlord404"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
