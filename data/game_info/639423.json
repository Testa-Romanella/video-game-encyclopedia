There are plenty of things that I want to add and improve. The first coming update will include a ton of levels. After that I want to include some cosmetic stuff. With each update I will also sprinkle in bug fixes as needed\u00a0(like how you can currently accidentally walk of the stage when resetting will be fixed in the next update).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse for looking &amp; aiming</li><li>Left Mouse Button for firing</li><li>WASD for movement</li><li>SPACE BAR for a tiny little baby jump</li><li>Hold TAB at the end of a stage to go to the next one</li><li>Hold ESCAPE while in a level to exit to main menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>As of v0.3b there are</strong></p>\n<ul><li>9 Distinct Levels</li><li>27 Medals to collect</li><li>Testing Trophy Room</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Recently Added in v0.3b</strong></p>\n<ul><li>3 New Levels</li><li>Reworked Settings Menu</li><li>Tons of Bug Fixes!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T07:34:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69b33197c4dd6a484313c418e499a911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tylur14"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
