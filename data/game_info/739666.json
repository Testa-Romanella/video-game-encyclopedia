It takes just under 2 minutes at max speed to get from the start to the end when using the treadmill- how fast can you make it through? Many objects are interactable within the space, and there are a couple of Easter eggs here and there. Designed for first time walkers, there are no jumpscares or things chasing you- the nuances of the experiences are up to you. Will you clear the maze as fast as possible? Or perhaps stroll through at your own pace?<br/><br/>This maze was built using free assets from the Unity Store, including the SteamVR Unity Plugin, so it seemed right that this project be distributed for free as well.<br/><br/>Useful desktop keybinds:<br/>Spacebar: Stop Treadmill<br/>RightShift: Start Treadmill<br/>Keypad0: Start/Stop Treadmill<br/>Keypad9: Boot/Shutdown/Reboot Infinadeck Plugin<br/><br/>LeftShift: Reset Level<br/>Escape: Quit Game<br/><br/>Keypad1: Toggle Deck Ring<br/>Keypad2: Toggle Deck Edge<br/>Keypad3: Toggle Deck Center<br/>Keypad4: Toggle Reference Panel<br/>Keypad5: Toggle In-Engine Deck<br/>Keypad6: Toggle Heading<br/>Keypad7: Toggle Colorblind<br/>Keypad8: Cycle Panel Theme<br/>KeypadPeriod: Import Preferences<br/>KeypadEnter: Reset Preferences<br/><br/>Alpha1: Set Timer to 1 Minute<br/>Alpha2: Set Timer to 2 Minutes<br/>Alpha3: Set Timer to 3 Minutes<br/>Alpha4: Set Timer to 4 Minutes<br/>Alpha5: Set Timer to 5 Minutes<br/>Alpha6: Set Timer to 6 Minutes<br/>Alpha7: Set Timer to 7 Minutes<br/>Alpha8: Set Timer to 8 Minutes<br/>Alpha9: Set Timer to 9 Minutes<br/>Alpha0: Set Timer to 10 Minutes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T03:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/58108ad39fc26b14e8b269386572956c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infinadeck"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Infinadeck"], "esrb_rating": null}
