In addition to interpreting a few of our favorite samples from Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s animal studies, the mausoleum playfully blends elements of shadow play, 19th century magic lantern shows, and early film set design.

Unlike the still photography that came before it, Muybridge's sequenced images could give viewers an eerily authentic impression of a body laboring through space. Not only was this a boon for scientific observation, it ultimately helped us realize that our senses could accept an artificial impression of life as a substitute for the real thing. Perfecting this substitution has been avidly pursued ever since. The rise of film, TV, and video games is a testament to our collective interest in experiencing a simulated presentation of the world. So it seemed fitting to create a space in virtual reality that acknowledges the new medium's lineage by calling back to Muybridge's early experiments.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca644ed0644370fa7e36c6f6d7afacb8.jpg", "website": "http://www.mostancient.com/projects/the-muybridge-mausoleum", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 102}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Most Ancient"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Most Ancient"], "esrb_rating": null}
