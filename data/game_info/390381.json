If not,\u00a0it's game over.</p>\n<p>Align three tiles with the same symbols to make a combo and\u00a0generate more tiles. The more\u00a0\u00a0combos you clear at the same time, the more tiles you will get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make points by clearing the symbol shown in the mission in the left corner. Each mission cleared makes the current level go up. Level 1 gives 1 point, level 2 gives 2 points and so on. Each time you pass a level, a new symbol is unlocked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time a tile goes overboard, it's a skip. You can only skip 9 times per level or else you will go down one level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Touch or Mouse:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Swipe to the left anywhere\u00a0:\u00a0Move tiles on the center bar to the left</li><li>Press on a tile and swip : Move this tile</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Y/Z: Move tiles on the center bar to the left</li><li>Directional arrows: Move cursor</li><li>Directional arrows (When a tile is selected): Move selected tile</li><li>X (pressing): Select a tile where the cursor is</li><li>Q: Restart a game</li><li>Backspace: Cancel last move (if possible)</li><li>P: Open menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T04:16:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a16562c9ca0499acd288e7c6c98bbaca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LeSam"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
