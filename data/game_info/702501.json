The tests have\u00a0gone quite successful\u00a0and\u00a0haven't\u00a0negatively affected you in any way. Suddenly, random insect-like aliens\u00a0have made it onto the planet. There's no\u00a0doubt that their intentions are to\u00a0overrun you. You attempt to escape\u00a0using the portals, but no matter what\u00a0you remain stuck on the planet. You\u00a0must travel through each portal\u00a0and find the source keeping the\u00a0portals from taking you home. Do you\u00a0have what it takes? Let's find out.</p>\n<p>As far as the modifications go for this, I wasn't able to perform a majority of them. I wanted to try and grenades for the player to use, a force field barrier to protect them, some different designs, hazards, etc. I'd say one of the most difficult parts was making the grenade using blender. The model that I made was simple, but it was a matter of trying to understand it as a whole. Not only that, but trying to get it so that the player could throw it was difficult as well. I tried looking through many different tutorials but they couldn't truly help me in the end. This is the same for the force field barrier as well.\u00a0For the hazards, it was difficult trying to think of any. Not only that, but it would require me to use blender. To which I'm still a novice at. I'm pretty sure developing a code would be easy to handle, it's the modeling that would be an issue.\u00a0</p><p>What I did do was recreate levels one and two. I also made an extra level that counts as the boss battle. I also managed to include a mini map for the player to get a different view to what they see as they progress through the levels. That's about it really. If I had more experience with coding and using blender, I'm positive I would have had the ability to follow through with my modifications. I also edited the 'Big Rock A' to make it so that the player can destroy it to get through and progress.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions:<br/></p><p>1.) Move mouse to look around.</p><p>2.) Use 'A' and 'D' to move left and right.</p><p>3.) Use 'S' and 'W' to move backwards and forwards.</p><p>4.) Use 'Spacebar' to jump; double tap it to perform a double jump.</p><p>5.) Use 1 and 2 to switch between guns.</p><p>6.) Use left mouse button in order to shoot projectiles.</p><p>7.) Use 'Esc' to pause or un-pause.</p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Creator: Devin Alexander Powell</p>\n<p>Game Engine Used: Unity</p>\n<p>Other Software Used: Blender</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/004/0046d7f00c00bcf0fd94c22db2d019f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web", "PC"], "developers": ["KingDp_217"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
