This is the Mini-Tarot-Workshop, this is for situations where you have a reading you have done for yourself and you need extra help, or another perspective, to really sink into what the cards are trying to tell you.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Please send along in your intro email a picture (or explanation) of the cards you have drawn for your reading, and a description of what you think is going on in the cards and what you need help with. Please keep it within 2 pages in length.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special note that I usually work within 5 card readings that folks send me, and send back a few notes to try and give some inspiration. It is your reading, so you have to come to your final conclusions on your own! This is just for some feedback. If you send longer readings to me, I will concentrate less on each card. Repeat customers may request feedback on longer readings at a raised price.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0It usually only takes a day or two to deliver readings, but please allow for up to a week for it to arrive depending on how popular these become.</p>\n<p>For a more standard reading please check out my\u00a0TAROT\u00a0or\u00a0RUNE\u00a0readings!\r\n</p>\n<p>For free divination, please check out\u00a0ORBITALS MAGAZINE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T06:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d4a582eada1ff7c3bbf70174457b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ruune"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
