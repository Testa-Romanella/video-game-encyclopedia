Then I saw the theme, \"Rewind\", I quickly adapted my draft to the theme and wrote the story, or I'd better say \"stories\", for the game.</p>\n<p>You're being tormented by nostalgia and sadness, so you decide to watch an old tape you recorded while walking at night in your city. The magic happens when you discover that watching and rewinding the tape you're able to revive that night through your soul. Now you have to move your soul around the city to find what's left of many events that happened that night: different stories interlaced, preserved in 8 tapes scattered around the city. But not all tapes are in the city at the same time, you may have to wait for a certain time of the night to see a tape appear, many other tapes will only appear after you've watched an other tape. You'll have to watch a tape and then rewind the main one, living again that night, to find the next tape. Each tape will tell a part of a story, slowly building a puzzle, but depending on the order you start discovering tapes the ending of the story will change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T05:25:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19bf97a0ed142fe590529f4c85500c7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TommyMP16"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
