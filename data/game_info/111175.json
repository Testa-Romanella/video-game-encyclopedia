At the museum, you are curiously drawn to the dusty remains of a skeletal hand, tucked safely behind a glass case, that legend tells once belonged to a powerful wizard. You instinctively put it on, ignoring the sign, \"DO NOT TOUCH\" -- and the world changes. As you walk through the museum, the artifacts come to life, some carrying spirits with timeless grudges against the wizard, who's hand now has become yours. </p><p>Wizard's Hand is created using Arcadia, an experimental framework consisting of Clojure and Unity, the core of which is being developed by Ramsey Nasser and Tims Gardner. The game also uses a custom glove controller embedded with a LEAP, made of EVA foam and 3D printed parts which light up using LEDs controlled by the FLORA. The glove is created by Kaho Abe who's work currently explores costumes as game controllers. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f0288854cb0ae77a8b9bb505dc95c90c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["agoodplace"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
