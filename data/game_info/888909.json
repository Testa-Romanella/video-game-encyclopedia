He is a completely new character complete with custom models, sounds, and\u00a0animations!</p>\r\nMoomoo is different to Mario and Luigi\r\n<p>Moomoo is heavier than Mario and Luigi and this comes with pros and cons. He can jump much\u00a0faster than the two plumbers, but he falls like a brick and can't wall-jump to save his life.
