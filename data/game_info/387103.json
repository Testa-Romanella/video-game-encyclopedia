Upon finding a text, they can collect it and read the part of the poem it refers to. Once all texts are gathered, the level is complete.</p>\n\n<p>The game is divided into 4 levels and each of them is referring to one of the Odyssey\u2019s thematic sections, namely:</p>\n<ul><li>the <strong>Telemachy </strong>(4 rhapsodies, from \u03b1 to \u03b4)</li><li>the <strong>Phaeacis </strong>(4 rhapsodies, from \u03b5 to \u03b8)</li><li>the <strong>Apologoi </strong>(4 rhapsodies, from mid \u03b9 to \u03bc)</li><li>the <strong>Mnesterophonia </strong>(12 rhapsodies, from \u03bd to \u03c9)</li></ul>\n<p>* * *<br/></p>\n<p>If we try to imagine the archetypal bard (in our case, the Homeric aoidos), we could see him in a banquet taking people\u2019s song requests and performing with his lyre. In a video game context, we can draw parallels between the actants of the above process and their game equivalents:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>The audience is the player</strong>. They are in control. Whatever they hear, it derives from their own agency, much like how someone uses a jukebox.</li><li><strong>The bard is the game</strong>. He mediates between the song and the audience and whenever asked, he starts but also stops performing.</li><li><strong>The song is the content</strong>, or, what the game is about.</li></ul>\n<p>Therefore, in this game the player experiences the <em>Odyssey\u2019s</em> story while assuming the role of the Homeric audience.</p>\n<p>The text used in the game comes from Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey. <br/></p>\n<p>-This game was part of my MA thesis-<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T05:17:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a0fe6a7d8b43ea295a875605c277fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thanos Makris"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
