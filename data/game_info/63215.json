At your disposal are several types of cannons, for which a number of forts are assigned.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAt the beginning of the battle you have a small stock of ammunition and can not equip all forts on the map with cannon. Therefore, place the guns in the most suitable forts, so as not to miss any enemy. With each destroyed ship, you can leave a stockpile of ammunition, with which you can increase the number of Coast Guard. On each map the location of the forts changes. Thoroughly consider the strategy of placing weapons at the beginning of each level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2605 achievements;<br/>\r\n\u2605 Pleasant graphics;<br/>\r\n\u2605 simple operation;<br/>\r\n\u2605 Interesting gameplay;<br/>\r\n\u2605 Easy music;<br/>\r\n\u2605 unforgettable adventures;<br/>\r\n\u2605 availability in 2 languages;<br/>\r\n\u2605 Two game modes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87e26b404e9bbd2620b55c70b3f6d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GiBar"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ILLUMICORP"], "esrb_rating": null}
