Combine wizards into towers, choosing their traits and attack styles for the best defence you can mount.</p>\n<p>Between battles spend your gems to improve the wizards of your Order and recruit new ones.\u00a0Follow the antics of the archmaster and her apprentice through a campaign of scenarios, and last as long as you can on challenging endless modes.</p>\r\nRelease Status\r\n<p>I've done all I plan to on the game and it should be reliably playable, but the current release is called 'beta' in case there is anything left to fix.</p>\r\nRequirements etc.\r\n<p>Should run on a fairly modest (modern) Windows machine. Requires mouse or other pointing device.</p>\n<p>Might run on OSX &amp; Linux, but I haven't tested that. I may add those labels if anyone tells me they work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f2688915e9f75926fd145fb1e4507e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Somewhat Unlikely"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
