But can you protect them from the elements long enough to claim the high score?<br/></p>\n<p>Your aim is to keep\u00a0the city alive as long as possible, but the problem is you can only make the world around the city\u00a0hotter or colder... Too hot and the landscape around the city burns up into a desert wasteland, and too cold and the land freezes into a permanent glacier.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>See if you can unlock the secrets of each biome (crops, forest, mountain, ocean)\u00a0and keep the city alive longer than any other streamer!\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS AND SCORING:</p>\n<p>You can hover on the Temp Up or Temp Down Buttons (bottom right corner)\u00a0to see a rough impact on the amount of temperature change to each tile (temp is in bottom left of each tile).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every turn, you choose whether to\u00a0move the temperature of the world up or down, bank the resulting biome resources (Materials, Food, Energy)\u00a0in the city (Center Tile), and add the City's population to your score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you bank enough resources to meet the city's requirement for expansion, your city will expand, you'll score some bonus points, and the resources you expend will be removed from your city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But BEWARE! With more population comes more pollution and wider more chaotic shifts in temperature from tile to tile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is over once the 8 tiles surrounding the city collapse into unusable deserts and glaciers.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T11:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e77/e77238f43a3aa10e4b9ae40732193274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Citrustux"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
