Help Pablo work through platforming challenges, but beware: His brains can only take limited amount of commands before he explodes into a million bits. He should probably get that looked at. I mean I wouldn't want to explode from thinking too much. Well that's probably why I don't in the first place. Like, if Pablo was controlling me, would my head explode too if I can't take a break? That's a thing. We gave Pablo this handy meter you can look at and see where his breaking point is though. We don't want him to explode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also we wanted to teach Pablo to dance, but we didn't have time. So that's sad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T11:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/8296545bfc8821c2d9d285189ae18ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ForkyM8", "Toxiii"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
