Since everything\u00a0was\u00a0character based smooth movement wasn't an option, and so a fast\u00a0shoot-em'up was born to make the most of the engine. The\u00a0graphics are\u00a0large and colourful, and are a nod to the later games by Don Priestly\u00a0who, starting with \"Trap Door\", produced a number of games with big,\u00a0bright graphics which were instantly endearing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> - \"<em>It's a\u00a0</em><em>no-excuses, colourful and fast-paced,\u00a0full-fat, caffeine-driven psychedelic shoot-'em up oozing class,\u00a0</em><em>originality, playability and addictiveness like no other</em>\" -\u00a09/10</p>\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0\"<em>splATTR's graphics take 'chunky' to a whole new\u00a0</em><em>level, but are colourful, detailed, and pretty smooth moving with\u00a0it...All of them are the sort of thing that presumably plague Matthew\u00a0Smith's nightmares. ...with three levels of difficulty and 32\u00a0unique\u00a0stages each with playing tips makes splATTR more strategic that it\u00a0</em><em>first appears and a solid, enjoyable challenge</em>\" - 91%</p>\n<p><strong>RGCD</strong>\u00a0- \"<em>It has to be said that this game just oozes polish - from the great\u00a0</em><em>music/sfx throughout and choice of difficulty levels, to the\u00a0re-definable keys and presentation options of radar type and\u00a0animated/static backgrounds.
