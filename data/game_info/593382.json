Stand up and hold the phone in front of you. Stay in the same spot, but point the top of your iPhone all around you and listen as the soundscape changes. Touch the screen and search all around you for other types\u00a0of sounds - these sounds represent the directions you can move in\u00a0from your present position. Aim the top of your phone at one of these sounds. Stand still and move the phone quickly\u00a0in a forwards-and-back motion to \"move\" to another spot in the virtual room.<br/><br/>Visit\u00a0tokeodin.dk/roomtone\u00a0for more info<br/><br/>Game Design and Sound Design by Toke Brorson Odin<br/>Programming by Tobias Due Munk<br/>Art by Barbara Amalie Skovmand Thomsen<br/>With special thanks to Nikolaj Kynde and Vinh Prag", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T04:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a58db92b8919c532889b8e69944158e0.jpg", "website": "http://tokeodin.dk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Toke Brorson Odin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Toke Brorson Odin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
