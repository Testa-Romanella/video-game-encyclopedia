{"id": 366284, "slug": "rainbow-sokoban", "name": "Rainbow Sokoban", "name_original": "Rainbow Sokoban", "description": "<p>\"Rainbow Sokoban\"\u00a0is a retro-style project I'm working on. It's currently in development still. I've finished the alpha and am working on the beta. I'll add more to this description as time goes by. Windows only.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys or WASD to move</p>\n<p>Enter: confirm menu selection</p>\n<p>Escape:\u00a0bring up menu or cancel</p>\n\n<p>There is also a way to skip levels, but I will leave that for you to find. It involves holding two keys and then pressing either the left or right arrow key.</p>\n<p>Notice - even though the current available levels do not use the full functionality of the three colors, this game is very much based on the interaction of them. Not only is the retro graphic difficult to work around, but there is a sort of color math going on that will make late puzzles in the game impossible to represent any other way.\u00a0There is no feasible way for me to make a special variation for color-blindness. I'm sorry. I\u00a0would never make a full-scale, saleable product in this way - but for my own purposes here I've kept things simpler for myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6e820ea63ef0d095d1fbcaa4f21529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keyofw"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
