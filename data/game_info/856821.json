It has to be comfortable and not awkward. A slingshot hand position fits comfortably with the hand and camera foaming a line of trajectory allowing me to play a game of slingshot comfortably.</p>\n<p>As for the theme, I was inspired by the recent wave of negative news coming from the east. I witnessed horrifying building explosions and thought to myself -\u00a0The only explosions people should ever love are firework explosions. By combining these 2 elements together led to this app development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T08:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/919/9190703238acbbbc216e0ea5d6946e86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Virtical"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
