States descended into chaos and their remains are ran by the corporations and private armies controller by warlords. The world has become a hunting ground where only one rule applies - survival of the fittest. But there is still hope, legendary City of the lights. Legend says, it\u2019s hard to reach the city and the journey requires many sacrifices. But legendary neon tank warriors are not scared of sacrifice and to reach the end of their journey they are able to sacrifice even components from their tanks.</p>\n<p><strong>You are one of the legendary neon tank warriors</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And this is your journey</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br />\n<strong>WASD / Arrow Keys</strong> Move tank around</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong> Aim</p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong> Primary Weapon</p>\n<p><strong>Right Mouse Button</strong> Secondary Weapon</p>\n<p><strong>CTRL / CMD + Q</strong> Quit game any time</p>\n<p><strong>Team:</strong><br />\nMartin Nov\u00e1k - Coding, 2D Graphics, Bitching Around<br />\nOnd\u0159ej Dovec - 3D Models, Enemy Design, Food Delivery<br />\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 T\u016fma - Level Design, Drinking Coffee<br />\nAdam Lys\u00e1k - Coding<br />\nWolar Games (Our company) - Web | Twitter | Facebook</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br />\nUnity, Photoshop, Blender, Audacity, DoTween (Unity Plugin)</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br />\nThis time we worked for around 24 hours in total (12 hours per day, 2 days)</p>\n<p>There is a known bug in the game that causes \u201cgive up\u201d text to disappear on the button. If this happens, the red button means -&gt; Double Click to Give Up. Another know bug is that under some circumstances some enemies might be able to push you out of level. We also had some performance problems with runtime nav mesh regeneration but that is hopefully fixed / improved.</p>\n<p>Source code is stripped of all the paid Unity plugins (editor extensions) and pro version of DoTween was replaced with free version. But the game is still fully functional. Requires Unity 2018.3.x (uses nested prefabs)</p>\n<p>We did not create all the Audio (we have downloaded music and some sound effects) so we opt-out Audio category.
