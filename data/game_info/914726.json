I spent many hours editing and sharing these games, and I would really appreciate the support.</p>\n<p>RULES: Click or space to move the knight up and down. Slay the slimes to earn gold. You can only slay a slime who's level is lower or equal to yours. If it's level is equal to yours, then there's only a 50% of you slaying it, but you will get 15 times more gold than the slimes level. Earn coins and level up! The slimes will also level up along with you. Every time you slay a slime, there is a 5% chance it will drop a golden blade, which you can use to slay any slime for 10 seconds. That's it! Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T15:46:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/877/877070ed7fdf0cc4ca3fa914e1191841.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hexlord"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
