The theme was \"GENRE but you can't MECHANIC.\"</p>\n<p>I went with\u00a0 \"A shooter where you can't reload\",\u00a0 the idea being that you have to constantly loot new guns off your enemies\u00a0as you only get a few bullets in each before running dry. You can also throw your empty guns at enemies, which ended up being quite overpowered.</p>\n<p>Had some trouble getting the hang of the game engine I decided to try, but I did at least manage to get the full gameplay loop and a basic implementation of all the mechanics in. I would have liked to put in a larger variety of guns, as well as injected a bit more juice.</p><p>Engine library used:\u00a0https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce389c62a70ab74fef2c4d0496151931.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["narfolomew"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
