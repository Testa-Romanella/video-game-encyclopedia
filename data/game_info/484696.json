A deep single-player campaign takes you through historic events on land, air, and sea, sabotaging Nazi bases, subverting enemy plans, aiding the French Resistance, and much, much more. With the Oculus Rift, we\u2019re bringing players into the Medal of Honor series in an entirely new way, with an experience that transports you back to Europe in the 1940s. It\u2019s the closest thing to a time machine you\u2019ll ever see.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T00:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ecd/ecda8b3b27cc70ff22a372b7854988e6.jpg", "website": "https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/3002462869834439/", "rating": 2.73, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 34, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 29, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Respawn Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Oculus Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
