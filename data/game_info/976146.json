Including character attributes, props, number of people, and so on. However, it does not reduce the operational requirements of the game, but rather allows players to make more choices with simpler operations. For example, players can summon and control enemy units to participate in battles. These units have abilities similar to player units. Players do not need to carry a large number of props, but can directly implement the same functions as props in map commands.<h3> Prequel works </h3>I was originally creating a reset version for my first game, but due to the focus being on a more concise war chess game, I lacked experience and made this game to understand the situation. The characters on the cover are actually the ones that will appear in the remake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T08:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a0/5a077b2eeec4dddb8ba7885e03798a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YScare"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YScare"], "esrb_rating": null}
