You can import and listen to the music you want.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>It is very easy to use Musicoota.</p>\n<ul><li>LEFT - RIGHT\u00a0to move between groups</li><li>UP - DOWN to move between songs</li><li>A to end a song or start a new one</li><li>B to resume or pause a song</li></ul>\n<p>It is very intuitive to use!</p>\n<p>You can find the progress of the song in the line above the title as you can see here</p>\n\r\nHOW TO ADD MUSIC\r\n<p>Once downloaded, open the pdx like a normal folder (if you have Mac you can right click and click 'open package contents') you will find a folder called 'music', within it you can create as many folders as you like with the name of the bands or albums you want, those folders will appear in the list on the left and will contain all the MP3 files. Once you have created the folders, you can place your MP3s inside them and they will appear in the list on the right.</p>\n\n<p>For easier understanding, I already left a \"No copyright music\" group with a song called \"Bali.mp3\" as a template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have some issues with empty folders that still appear even after deleting the group folder, go to your SDK folder, then go to DISK, and instead going to\u00a0GAMES\u00a0(where your games are), go to DATA and delete the folder \"com.tauchme.musicoota\". To avoid this, don't create any empty group folder.</p>\n\n<p>Icons designd by my close friend\u00a0<strong>B0redCuerv0</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>I DON'T OWN A PLAYDATE PHYSICAL CONSOLE YET AND THIS GAME HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED ON IT</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T12:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/82600f1a71d066e5d1e425a9efa037d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TauchMe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
