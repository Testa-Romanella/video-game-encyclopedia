This evolutionary tree led to Gunstorm and Gunstorm II, 3D versions which use a similar game metric. Outliner (on Amiga and PC) also use this metric, and the control system used in Flatspace was directly inspired by it.</p>\n<p>Roton was my first full-screen PC game, written\u00a0in 1999 and originally bundled with Trax and Martian Rover Patrol on CD-ROM. Updated in 2023\u00a0for modern computers.

Money from sales and donations here helps fund this goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T21:41:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b7dc841d74687554eedcc1eaea9732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
