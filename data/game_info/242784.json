{"id": 242784, "slug": "speed-of-light-sol", "name": "Speed of Light (SoL)", "name_original": "Speed of Light (SoL)", "description": "<p>Speed of Light is a semi-realistic space strategy game for Windows that obeys\u00a0the universal speed limit. You take the role of both deep space radar operator and fleet commander. Command your ships to investigate unidentified objects and protect your base, but be warned - it takes longer for signals to reach your ships the farther they stray, and if you stretch your forces too thin you may be caught defenseless!</p>\n<p>The game is played entirely through a radar viewscreen, using minimalist 2D graphics.</p>\n<p>Please note that the game is in a fairly\u00a0early state, with numerous features yet to be added. It is however in a fully playable state, and each release is designed to be a complete experience (no half-broken menus or unfinished mechanics). Bugs are of course to be expected, and the game is still very unbalanced.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b1153f1ad305144bd39812fefbff72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polyester Frogs"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
