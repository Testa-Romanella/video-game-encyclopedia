Grow. Evolve.</strong>\n<p>In Polygrowth, the player begins as a prokaryote, represented by a triangle. As mutations fly toward the player, some manage to stick in the population; others don\u2019t. Once enough mutations have been collected, the player evolves into a more complex creature, and the polygon gains an additional side. How far can you evolve?</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>In Polygrowth, players strive to collect \u201cmutations\u201d which drive their \u201cevolution\u201d - becoming more complex and \u201csurvival\u201d becoming more difficult along the way. \u201cEvolution\u201d of this sort is fairly common in\u00a0video games, but in real life, evolution is less about \u201cLeveling Up\u201d than it is simply about change and survival. Biological evolution is defined as any change in the genetic inheritance of an interbreeding group of living things over several generations. Changes that improve a living thing\u2019s ability to survive (i.e. make it more competitive) that can be passed on will spread through interbreeding groups over time as the survivors breed. As generations pass, those\u00a0changes can add up\u00a0- and\u00a0new species can form.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>Evolution will be the central story the ROM plans to highlight in its upcoming\u00a0Dawn of Life Gallery. Still in the planning stages, this gallery is being spearheaded by\u00a0Dr. Jean-Bernard Caron, the ROM\u2019s\u00a0Curator of Invertebrate Palaeontology\u00a0and a world-leading expert on the the\u00a0Burgess Shale\u00a0- a fossil locality of global importance found in the Rocky Mountains of\u00a0Yoho National Park, British Columbia. The\u00a0extraordinary fossils\u00a0of the Burgess Shale studied at the ROM inform our understanding of the early evolution of\u00a0many\u00a0different\u00a0animal\u00a0groups.\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28a2a7a985e2bc04a9466dc84d60e65c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
