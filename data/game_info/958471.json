Your job is simple: Watch the cameras and keep the crew safe. There are five cameras installed on this spacecraft. You can switch between them by pressing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\r\n</p>\n<p>Intruders are unlikely, but anything could happen this far out in space. If you notice anything strange in any of the cameras (object disappearance/movement, an extra object, etc.), we encourage you to release our newly developed Organism Disintegration Gas (O.D.G.) by pressing the space bar. Due to the limited supply of O.D.G., you will only be able to release the gas in one room at a time.\r\n</p>\n<p>All of your crewmates should currently be in cryogenic sleep, so there is no need to worry about the O.D.G. affecting them. Your shift lasts from 12 am until 6 am. After that, you may return to cryosleep.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck.\r\n</p>\n<p>END OF MISSION BRIEF</p>\n<p>The game was mainly inspired by I'm on Observation Duty and partially inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's.</p>\n<p>Comments are always appreciated.</p>\n<p>Sound effects and music obtained from www.zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T18:01:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba328aaaf03f504d67958ce26a8874dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RandomTreeGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
