This is that wave's story.</p><p>Initially developed for Global Game Jam 2017 by a team of five, this game lets you control the direction of a crowd wave. Click on the screen and drag, avoiding grumps who will break the wave and end the game. Be sure to keep track of your \"shot\" meter--once it's full, unclicking the screen will send forth a fast crowd wave across the screen, which will make even the grumpiest grumps join in on the fun!</p><p>This game is an early, pre-alpha prototype that is currently under development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/308bb1329443cc5c218632cf514775a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PosthumanWizard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
