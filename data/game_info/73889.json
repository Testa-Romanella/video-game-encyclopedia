The finest assets used in the critically acclaimed Arma\u2122 series on PC now come to life on the mobile platforms, in one of the best looking mobile games to date.<br/><br/>Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where the player takes control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it\u2018s up to the player to decide how he will play through  both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.<br/><br/>With highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and whole campaigns to be regularly added, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.<br/><br/>* Having problems?
