The game is pretty short mostly due to the limits of the Pico-8 map editor. I can't use unity since I don't have access to my PC and my laptop can't use it. For the time being Pico-8 is a decent replacement. In a few days I can get back to my PC again and use unity. Also I'm going into 9th grade in month so I'll be pretty busy. Thanks for playing and comment what you think I should make next.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T05:50:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c3ddc50658aed55e098cf79324503f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tweedie2014"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
