The first and the last time I had used GameMaker.</p><p>The gameplay lasts 1-2 minutes. It's not explained, but the game ends after the second conversation with professor. Space acts as A button, I opens and closes inventory, you move around using arrow buttons.</p><p>\"We need to go back to the nineties!\" - these are the last words you heard before you went back in time to 1995 - a year, which - this time - you surely won't forget!</p><p>Tileset made by Muziak, taken from http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/71895.htm.
