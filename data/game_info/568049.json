But there's a twist: Wherever the ground is marked, you may switch the layer you're walking on - between foreground and background - for an extra dimension of puzzle-solving. <br/><br/>Experience a visual narrative telling the story of two companions that traverse an abandoned world. Of a  place that has been deserted long ago, and protagonists freeing the spirits that have been left behind. Discover unique abilities and use them to unveil mysteries; alone or together with a friend. <br/><br/>Oh, and there are fragments of spirits hidden in all nooks and crannies. Can you find them all? <br/><br/>Forgotten Spirits' audio design has been awarded and contributes to the games' distinct atmosphere. Its original soundtrack has been composed by Sam Shandley, and the game itself was built from the bottom up by a small team of students in Norway. Thank you all for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T02:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/230bdbd2aca760e3d2f6d944b860929c.jpg", "website": "https://studiofrostbit.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Frostbit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Studio Frostbit"], "esrb_rating": null}
