This is quite a bummer for me and the rest of the team, but we have worked to provide a new and better version, outside the scope of the Extra Jam. The downloadable package you find on this page is still bugged and won't changed before the end of the jam.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>If anyone wants to try the real challenges the game offers outside the scope of the Extra Jam, please feel free to download the updated version from this link:<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Maus 0.2<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Our brave Maus is finally old enough to face his first adventures but...Grandpa is visibly worried. He cannot follow his grandson in this adventure and take care of him.</p>\n<p>Armed with wisdom and experience, he does what he know best: give <strong>Suggestions</strong>!</p>\n\n<ul><li>Each suggestion is made of a <strong>Condition </strong>and an <strong>Action</strong>, that Maus will perform once the Condition is present</li><li>Maus can act when he <em>faces an enemy</em>, or <em>the road is blocked</em>, or even if he still <em>has space in his inventory</em></li><li>If triggered, Maus can <strong>use the first item</strong> at hand, <strong>interact </strong>with his surroundings or simply <strong>ignore the danger</strong> and walk on!</li><em> </em> <li>Grandpa can give up to <strong>three suggestions</strong> to Maus, and their <strong>order matters</strong>! Maus will try to remind them in order when facing a danger!</li></ul>\n<p>Danger? No one told me there were dangers!</p>\n<ul><li>The forest is full of dangers, but Maus is ready to face them!</li><li>During his travels, he could face enemies, like the terrible <strong>Crowguard </strong>or the insidious <strong>Knighttens</strong>, or maybe bump into <strong>Pits </strong>and <strong>Ponds</strong>! Check the Encyclopedia to find out their behavior and weaknesses. Don't ignore enemies, <strong>use</strong> the right tools against them!</li><li>Bumping into roadblocks or <strong>interacting </strong>with enemies will result in Maus <strong>fleeing back</strong> home...sometimes, this can be used at your advantage, to pass again on Treasures you ignored the first time...</li></ul>\n\n<p>Delving into interactions:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ignoring </strong>Crowguards and Knighttens will result in a Game Over for our brave Maus, but don't worry! You can always try a different strategy!</li><li><strong>Ignoring </strong>Ponds and Pits will make Maus change his direction to find things he ignored the first time (like Treasures or Locked Chests, for example...)</li><li>Likewise, <strong>Interacting </strong>with enemies will change your direction!</li><li><strong>Ignoring </strong>Treasure and Locked Chests will simply skip the chest, that will remain active on the trail!</li><li><strong>Using the right item</strong> on Crowguards or Knightten will defeat them, and possibly give you a Key for a Locked Chest on the trail. <strong>Use the wrong item</strong>, and the foes will attack you!</li><li><strong>Using the right item</strong> on a Pit or Pond will allow you to continue on your journey, but failing to choose the correct one yields no major consequences...just some confusion!</li><li>Remember! To <strong>unlock a Treasure Chest</strong> you need to <strong>Interact</strong> with it, but to <strong>open a Locked Chest</strong> you have to <strong>Use a Key</strong> from your first item slot!</li></ul>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Eleonora Santucci (Artstation Link):</em> sprites for Maus, Grandpa, Knightten and Crowguard, Treasure chests</li><li><em>Francesco Abbonizio:</em> UI and Level Design</li><li><em>Gabriele D'Amen:</em> programming</li><li>External: Autumn Parallax Forest by <em>TvdM1986 </em>(Unity Store), Fantasy Wooden GUI Free (Unity Store), Music Loops Mini Set by <em>Andrey Sitkov</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T06:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/88676ace6a77e5ac2b12077e26bb91df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthair"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
