From simple follow scripts during the 8-bit era, to full on machine learning so that they improve their skills just from watching your own playstyles, artificial intelligence is becoming more and more human every day.<br/></p>\n<p>I can say without a doubt that the A.I. in this game is unlike any you have seen before, and one that is impossible to win in a duel against. The reason why is a secret which we best leave close to our chest, lest the bigwigs at AAA studios try to steal it. Try our game for yourselves, and see if you can win :)</p>\n<p>(Sponsored by Fromjaf A.I.
