Sure, slaying monsters is fun, but the pay is GARBAGE! If only there was a way to take greater risks on your adventures so you could score more loot...\"</p>\n<p>That's what the Hero thought until two magicians showed up claiming to have the secret to earning a fortune through questing! Sure, their prophecies are inconsistent at best, but hey--he'll take all the help he can get. And with their support, he's sure to earn a FORTUNE!</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>-RIGHT: Sword attack. Lose HP (the red bar) equal to a monster's power. When there's no encounter on the screen, press RIGHT to go to the next encounter.</p>\n<p>-UP: Fireball. Instantly defeats monsters. Costs 3 MP.\u00a0 (the blue bar)</p>\n<p>-LEFT: Go to the next day. Your HP and MP are fully restored.</p>\n<p>-DOWN: Reroll the next few enemies so that they're different than what the magicians say.\u00a0 Costs 1 MP, and can only be done when not in an encounter.</p>\n\n<p>Made in 3 days for the Fantasy Game Jam hosted by Tadeas Salvatore Jun.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Setteduetto:\u00a0 Lead Designer, Programmer, Pixel Artist, Sound</p>\n<p>Jennifer Kalkhoven: Lead Artist, Designer</p>\n<p>Glitched.Galaxy: Portrait Artist, Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:10:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a7/3a7e835a30d93c756944cbae13ff7281.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["setteduetto"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
