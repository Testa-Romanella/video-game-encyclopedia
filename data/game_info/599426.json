This is N4TH nice to meet you.</p>\n<p>Wow! how can you get here? this is amazing, oh yeah details of the game.</p>\n<p>This is the game I made with gdevelop, It's a simple adventure game about a hero that fight enemy. Yeah simple, but it's hard!!! I challange you guys to beat this game, It's really fun. Share to your friend and compete who win first is a good idea! This is also free, I just wanna share my game to the world! I beat this game once with super effort. And I hope you guys can also beat this game. How to play? SIMPLE:</p>\n<p>Jump=SPACE<br/></p>\n<p>Attack=X</p>\n<p>Move Right=Right arrow</p>\n<p>Move left=Left arrow</p>\n<p>I gave you guys 2 option of downloading, you can download a pdf that contain a link, copy it and paste in google to play it. And the other is the ZIP file, dowload it, compress it, search the JSON file, and BOOM done. But to use ZIP option you need the gdevelop app or you must save and compress the file at google drive then you need to search gdevelop in google than click open a project option and choose the from google drive. It's up to you :D. I hope you guys enjoy, this is fre, I don't really make this for money making at all, just for fun! Bur there is 1 thing you MUST do! Leave a comment ofcourseeeee, Let me know your tought of my game! Give me advice since I am an ameteur. Oh yeah,\u00a0 I know this game is hard (In my opinion) but THIS IS 100% POSSIBLE! So don't give up! Here I'll give you some advice, tips, and trick:</p>\n<p>1. Fight the enemy with the hero character facing right screen</p>\n<p>(Hero)-&gt;(Enemy) correct\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Enemy)&lt;-(Hero) wrong, you can use this for kill the slug enemy, but for slime, bat, and especially Ghost, don't you ever do this cause it can make no kill.</p>\n<p>but I design this game to be hard, so for the level 4 you'll face this situation against bat. How to kill it? Search for a right moment, press space and x and hold it, I usually do that. If not just run away (ghost situation) or avoid the area (search other path) or try to make the facing direction become the right one which is Hero facing right!</p>\n<p>2. Ghost, ghost is hard to kill, the collision box was pretty little. So to kill it you must be facing the right direction and hold space and x. You also need the right moment, so come to the ghost and let it become near to you, then start to press space and x.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. NEVER GIVE UP! You will become used to the game, You'll know when you need to becarefull and elses, so just give it a try until succeed ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Last word I want to Thanks Wishforge Games because he is my inspiration at making this game, and also I use his downloadable assets. You know Wishforge, don't you? Well if you dont know then.... SEARCH AT YOUTUBE NOW! he is really good at telling how to make the game, don't forget to subs him. He also have an itch.io account, go see him.</p>\n<p>Thankyou very much guys!!!
