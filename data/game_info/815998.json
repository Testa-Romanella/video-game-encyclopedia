It's not very original, visually pleasing nor well made. It's a dumpster, but its my dumpster. Hope you find some amusement in it. (You can also make speedruns of it easily).<br/></p>\n<p>P.D.: Do not try to close the game (big 'X' in the corner) it will simply freeze the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036306cd07ee32837cf3bc95d936e57a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Desk-24"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
