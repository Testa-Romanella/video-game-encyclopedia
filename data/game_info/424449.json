You play as the operator of the autonomous combat agent Aramis and support their efforts in battle by managing several decks of cards through slot machines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It's a fairly small game, it wasn't greatly playtested and it mostly serves to display and test what I think are interesting ideas about realtime deck builders and single player auto-battlers. Hopefully the game managed to explain itself in the tutorials. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>this game is available in english and portuguese</p>\n<p>este jogo est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel em ingl\u00eas e portugu\u00eas brasileiro</p>\n\n<p>this game was made by:</p>\n<p>Nat\u00e1lia Amorim</p>\n<p>Ra Irigaray<br/></p>\n<p>as umunum</p>\n\n<p>with:</p>\n<p>fonts by Eeve Somepx and DuffsDevice</p>\n<p>palette AA-64 by Adigun Polack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73f/73f4798230260224078a05ba064c1074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["umunum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
