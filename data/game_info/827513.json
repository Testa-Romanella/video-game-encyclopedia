To do so I started making \"Junkworld\", a 3d action platformer. Since I started development, Junkworld went through a few major changes and in it's current state, I would describe it as a \"3d Bullet Hell Action Platformer\". <br/></p>\n<p>In a way I am making this game for myself; to learn how to program and make games by myself. But I would be lying if I said I wouldn't want Junkworld to be played, loved and enjoyed by as much players as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>That is where this demo comes in. Junkworld, and this demo, in it's current state are far, far, far, far from finished. But this demo should give a <strong>pretty good impression</strong> of the main game loop.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>I would love for you to play this demo and let me know what you think.

This has always been a working title, and it seems a hand full of other games are also named \"Junkworld\". However I still refer to is as such in my devlogs, for recognition sake. However I have been playing around with some new names, and as this day forward the new working title will be \"Wrenched\".<br/></p>\n\n<strong>Want to know more about the Development?</strong>\n<p>If you want to know more about the development of the project I have been recording devlogs and documenting every step.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T11:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3dad3b88cfd991b1017e36c8c9c8cd8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cherry Nugget Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
