Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation. While she\u2019s home, she\u2019s making some extra money as a photographer for the Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!<br />\nThimbleweed Park hasn\u2019t changed at all in the year since Delores has been away\u2026 or has it?<br />\n\u2026Since when is the S&amp;D Diner a five-star establishment?<br />\n\u2026When did the PillowBear\u2122 become all the rage?<br />\n\u2026Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards?<br />\n\u2026How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the bridge a year ago?<br />\n\u2026Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.<br />\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least of your problems...<br />\nDelores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure started out as a prototype for Ron Gilbert\u2019s new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.<br />\nThis was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively \u201cfound art\u201d from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we couldn\u2019t go outside IRL.<br />\nAs a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can have fun with in these odd times. You don\u2019t have to have played Thimbleweed Park to enjoy this mini-adventure. (But if you do enjoy it, why not check out Thimbleweed Park, hmm?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T20:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/764/7640e2f467e9c14e095492aa76b72c31.jpg", "website": "https://thimbleweedpark.com/", "rating": 2.48, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 157, "owned": 1285, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 13, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 47, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 48, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Terrible Toybox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Terrible Toybox"], "esrb_rating": null}
