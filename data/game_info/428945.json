Element takes BR to the next level with realistically balanced controls and mechanics. With rising walls that will kill anyone behind them this prevents camping and forces all players to the center of the map, creating an absolute blood bath at the end. Guns and ammo are scarce, allowing for more close combat situations with melee. The water outside of the map is toxic and will kill you in seconds if you dare go in. In overall the goal is to survival and thrive against others, and to be the last man standing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:16:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4b8c0645577bdd35e5a392ee64e8de5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YoAvrageStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YoAvrageStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
