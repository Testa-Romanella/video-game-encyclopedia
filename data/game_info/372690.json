It seems that your life is about to change, but... you can not even imagine how much. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a comic adventure with harem elements, where you can meet and improve relationships with four girls - the residents of the bunker. They are surprisingly very pleased with their new guest. Perhaps this is because they\u2019ve never seen anyone from the \"surface\"?
