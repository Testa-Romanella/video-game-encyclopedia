With it, you will help your Mandaread to grow, your hopeful companion on the path to becoming fluent in the chinese official language.<br/><br/>The ideograms were taken from a list of simplified characters of the HSK exam, which is an official test of proficiency in mandarin, involving six levels of certification.<br/><br/>In this first version, the app has over 500 hanzi (characters) for you to pactice your reading skills, ranging from HSK1 to HSK3. They were separated in 25 levels, ordered by the most frequent character, meaning the most used and easy to identify, to the least frequent.<br/><br/>After each group of 5 levels, your Mandaread will grow and develop new forms, setting a landmark to celebrate the improvement in your studies.<br/><br/>To answer the characters shown to you and complete the levels, you\u2019ll need to type the respective Pinyin, which means you\u2019ll need to know how you pronounce the character, including the correct tones.<br/><br/>As a student of chinese, you know that it\u2019s a tonal language, and we use Pinyin as a romanization of chinese characters, and tones must be used to make it possible to distinguish the meanings between words.<br/><br/>In order to further help you with your learning, as a bonus, each time you check your answer, the character\u2019s translation to English will be shown (and also, if you\u2019re interested, in Portuguese) and, in case you get it wrong or just don\u2019t know it, you\u2019ll also be able to see the correct answer. With it, you will be able to view your stats and try again, to keep improving your skills.<br/><br/>MandaRead is a great way to train and keep your knowledge of chinese characters in check, acting as an awesome tool to help you practice the language and reach your goals.<br/><br/>Again, this is a very simplistic and totally gratuitous educational app made entirely to help students better retain the learning of chinese characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b512f439458bd1a71e20999b49d4f033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoaksStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
