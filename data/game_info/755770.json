Until now, the\u00a0forest was thought to be a place of legend. Few humans have\u00a0ever stepped foot in that primeval wood. The trees\u00a0themselves resist the intrusion of outsiders. But it is not\u00a0things of wood and leaf that represent the greatest dangers.</p>\n<p>Fey creatures such as the willawen, skak, gallybeggar, and\u00a0korrigan might steal or slay on whim. In the darkest glades,\u00a0Elk Witches summon creatures of moss and lichen to\u00a0perform their baneful bidding.\u00a0The dangers are manifold but the legends speak of a cairn at\u00a0the center of the forest. It is said to hold great power. It is\u00a0said to restore life to the dead. Thus party after party, greed\u00a0outweighing\u00a0caution, have entered the forest. Thus far, none\u00a0have returned. Who can say what they found or whether they\u00a0still live?</p><p>This pamphlet adventure may be printed and used at your table for <em>Cairn </em>or similar rules-light games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:34:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f6ea66ad349f9418272f4c034369d24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KNIGHTOWLPUB"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
