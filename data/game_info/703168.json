We had a blast coming up with big ideas for the story we wanted to tell. \u00a0It was fun creating a little world and trying new things. \u00a0We all tried something new during this development and are proud of what we made. There's still a lot of things we wish we could have added but there's only so many hours in a day. If you're wanting more, let us know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2ff9d4507c2cceb187fb580d8dd6f58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Little Big Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
