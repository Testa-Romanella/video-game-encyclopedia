Players start as The Summoner, a cultist in training. Step one: get to know the townsfolk! Learn their names, relationship dynamics, and interests\u2026 and then exploit them for your personal gain. Step two: Use the information you have gathered to efficiently convert new members. Be warned, civilians may go insane, so it\u2019s best to be strategic in your advances. Once a new member is recruited, they become a controllable character. This allows for several unique interactions and paths to victory(hint: some paths are better than others). Have fun, but remember: Teieghged is always watching. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey Features<br/>\r\n-Interactive puzzles<br/>\r\n-Unique dialogue options for every character<br/>\r\n-Ability to control any character<br/>\r\n-Lovecraftian elements", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T05:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff15852350f077035fbba1f3f9641dea.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/theendofitall", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattRX", "deathonabun15", "TheFrostSpartan", "ahockenberry", "Metal1081", "CabbagePantz", "TheOneder", "Ross Box", "STOREBRAND CORP", "vixenPi", "KasiLaxman", "Tentacult Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tentacult Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
