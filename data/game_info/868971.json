Upon finding an animal, it is rated out of 3 stars in each category (Cuteness, Chunkiness, Smartness). A full 9 stars is not something to snuff at! Especially because for select animals, you can uncover Easter Eggs by naming them specific things. Can you find all 35 animals? How many 9 stars will you find? Can you figure out 1 of the 12 Easter Eggs? Find out in Habitation!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T12:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f1e7eede4c2d3b318a8b3715230d2b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BernieTheChicken"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
