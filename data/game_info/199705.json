Using quick timing and careful placement you will move the bricks into complete rows to remove them before they become too high. As you clear more and more the challenge will only become harder as the bricks fall faster and appear more rapidly. How long will you last?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de72977032f221e1aedca8ed43bad637.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew1232333"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
