Help a gorilla get clean or rescue a sick puppy.  Collect coins along the way to unlock items, animals and other islands.</p><p>With over 25 animals, 8 environments and 2 islands, there's lots to enjoy in this FREE game!</p><p>I created Vet Island for my daughter - Ellie. Out of the blue one day she asked \"Dad, could you make me an animal doctor game?\". So, after 10 months of hard work (mostly during nap, nights and weekends) I'm happy to share Vet Island with the world. Ellie is very happy with the game and I hope your little one is too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/163/163e220bf2b961ec8144f597b992365b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erik Bye"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
