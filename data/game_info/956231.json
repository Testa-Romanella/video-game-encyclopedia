We used Unity to build the project. The project features a fox character as the central focus. Users can control the fox using a hardware component, which utilizes an Arduino gyroscope and a custom-made fox-shaped glove for gesture-based controls. The experience is designed to take players on a journey across a vibrant island environment, where they will encounter various interactive elements that lead to the fox's evolution. The project incorporates traditional Chinese elements such as the Kirin, the Pakua (Eight Trigrams) , and the use of Kongming lanterns to create a unique and culturally rich experience. The game is both engaging and educational, with a focus on displaying the beauty of Chinese culture.<br/></p>\n\n<p>*This is the Keyboard version.
