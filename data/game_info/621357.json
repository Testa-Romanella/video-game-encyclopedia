Use your magic stinger to defeat her and free the insects of Russia!</p>\n<p>This game is a submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2021.\u00a0The theme is joined together.\u00a0I interpreted the theme as having the bee and the stinger joining together. When you have the stinger, you can shoot, but when it disconnects, you can use bombs.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It's technically a roguelike, but it doesn't really feel like one.\u00a0If I had more time, I would have added more items and bosses to give it more of a roguelike feel.</p>\n<p>I created all art, music, and sound effects myself. Most of it was created before the jam, because I had the idea for this game a while ago.</p>\n<p>If there's problems with the browser version, you can download the game for windows and mac.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/527497d200b604f867a696834d67f646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["polka dot"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
