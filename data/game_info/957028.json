Check his video!]</em></p>\n<p>Do you know <strong><em>you are the best cook</em></strong> but your friends keep laughing at your meals? Are you willing to learn new recipes to <strong><em>impress your secret crush</em></strong>? Or maybe you wish to get a first cook experience in a restaurant to <strong><em>show on your resume</em></strong>? You are at the right place!</p>\n<p>In this game, you will try to deliver as many orders as possible and maximize your restaurant income. You want to show of your skills to your folks? Invite them to play with you!\u00a0What are you waiting for? Go\u00a0get\u00a0these burgers hot and ready!</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;Development Note&gt;</strong></p>\n<p>This game replicates CodeMonkey's original tutorial game with some new features. I am getting back to develoment seriously and starting from this tutorial helped get some development\u00a0habits and confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the new features I implemented:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>local multiplayer up to 3 players (WASD, keyboard arrows and gamepad controls)</strong></li><li><strong>lobby menu with full controller navigation support which required creating a custom navigation script</strong></li><li><strong>detection of disconnected devices in the lobby and in game, making some control options unavailable for selection or pausing the game and showing a new UI</strong></li><li><strong>changed the game design by adding a value to each recipe and displaying the total amount in the end</strong></li></ul>\n<p>All the code is available here:\u00a0https://github.com/BnLds/ExpandingCodeMonkeysTutorialGame</p>\n<p>While I do have other ideas I would like to implement, I think it would be more beneficial for me to pause this project and start building games from scratch. My ultimate goal is to build a portfolio which could get me a job as game dev and I believe personal projects would just shine more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e85/e852dc70870ed6f78d88fd520a8bb44a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Benjamin Landes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
