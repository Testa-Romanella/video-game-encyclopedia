The theme was\u00a0<strong>Blocked</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>You are a construction worker at an advanced AI-run construction site. A zombie outbreak has been unleashed and you decide to hunker down as waves of zombies come stampeding towards you. Block their way with objects constructed by the AI's fabricators.</p>\n<p>You have a choice of placing: make shift obstacles, wooden crates, concrete bollards and shipping containers. <br/></p>\n<p>You also have a moveable turret that respawns ammo over time.</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can, there are too many, the end is inevitable. Try to take out as many of them on your way out as you.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W/S - Move Gun Turret up/down</p>\n<p>Left Click - Select/Place Obstacles</p>\n<p>Right Click - Shoot/Cancel Placement<br/></p>\r\nBugs\r\n<p>Sometimes a zombie might get stuck in an obstacle, this usually resolves itself.    </p>\n<p>It can be a little fiddly selecting/placing obstacles.</p><p>\u00a0Sometimes the Shipping Container generation will just go nuts. <br/></p><p>Not really a bug but it was intended that the obstacles would be placed exactly on the paths. You can cheat a little by spamming placement but I suspect that will likely cause issues when you're trying to shoot.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\nGame Design/Programming\r\n<p>Derwent Ready\r\n</p>\r\nArt\r\n<p>Zombie - Kenney (modified by Derwent Ready)</p>\n<p>Shipping Container - Kenney (modified by Derwent Ready)<br/></p>\n<p>Kenney - CC0<br/></p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/sewer-nightclub - CC0<br/></p>\r\nAudio\r\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/zombies-sound-pack - Zombie Vocal SFX - CC0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T18:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cf/1cf86b1f89e5842e2137a21a57bb85cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Drentsoft Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
