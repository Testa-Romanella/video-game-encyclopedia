So just keep in mind that the game might not run perfectly.</p>\n<p>Discord server: https://discord.gg/jKXvXyTzYn\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/379/379e4142b4105125d24d1effa032eff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["V0LT"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
