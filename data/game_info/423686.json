Unfortunately, she's about to find out that her small town is at the epicenter of something a bit more dastardly...and she might not like who's been the brains behind it the whole time.</p>\n<p>This micro-narrative was crafted over a week's time, 24 collective hours of development, as a type of Game\u00a0Jam challenge to make as complete a narrative as possible within the RPG Maker MV engine using as little extra resources as possible. It should take no longer than an hour to complete the narrative.</p><p>This game is free to download, but if you wish to donate to help me develop other games in the future, it would be greatly appreciated. Also, feel free to hit me up on Twitter or\u00a0Instagram using the hashtags #CornettCatalyst or #TheCornettMultiverse to discuss the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f77847d77e1f3dbc6c0e0fbf399ae4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thejamesmcornett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
