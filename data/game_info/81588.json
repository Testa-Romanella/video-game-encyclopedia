Except that this game has a big twist. It allows you to draw a second time! Place your wager, 1 to 5 credits per hand.  Then tap \"Deal\". Select the cards you want to keep and tap \"Draw\" and as expected, you'll draw new cards. Now, here's the twist. If you want, you can draw the cards again! You'll have to pay the same amount as your original wager and you'll have to give up whatever winnings you won on the first draw. But, any winnings from the second draw you keep! So, if you have 4 cards to a Royal Flush, you can draw again to try to get it! How fun is that?!? <br/><br/>Another unique feature are the \"Gold Cards\". You collect Gold Cards by playing the game or purchasing them. After you have drawn your cards (possibly twice), you can use a Gold Card to replace a single card with ANY card you want! <br/><br/>Double Draw Video Poker Five Play contains these Video Poker favorites: <br/>\u2022 Jacks or Better <br/>\u2022 Bonus Poker <br/>\u2022 Double Bonus Poker <br/>\u2022 Double Double Bonus Poker <br/>\u2022 Triple Double Bonus Poker <br/>\u2022 Deuces Wild <br/><br/>Double Draw Video Poker Five Play doesn't ask you to purchase more credits from the app store.
