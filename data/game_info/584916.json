Your goal is to build a sandcastle, find treasures, and decorate the castle. Explore and solve puzzles to find five treasures, then drop them onto your sandcastle and admire your work. <br/><br/><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br/>This game includes a tutorial to help players learn to play classic \"text adventure\" style games, and the game is suitable for children. This is my entry for the Text Adventure Literacy Jam. It is the first game I released! =)<br/></p>\n<p>I was inspired by visiting Grand Beach, Manitoba when I was a kid. The locations are based on this, particularly the sand hills and frog pond</p>\n<p>Art is in the \"textmode\" style. It was created using lvllvl.com using the \"Atari 2600 NTSC\" colour palette and \"c64_real_shifted\" tileset. The font used for the text in-game is \"plotter bold extended\" by Damien Guard.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/>Basically type one or two words and press Enter!<br/>If you're new to the game, be sure to choose the tutorial option in startup!<br/>The tutorial can be turned on or off with \"tutorial on\" or \"tutorial off\".<br/><br/>Here is a list of some basic commands:</p>\n<ul><li>Travel: North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W)</li><li>Actions: Use two word verb noun combinations... e.g. \"take bucket\", \"drop seashell\", \"give glasses\"...</li><li>Other useful commands: \"I\" (inventory), \"R\" (clear/refresh the screen), \"quit\" to restart, and \"hint\" to get some help depending on where you're at in the game.</li></ul>\n<p>If you encounter any unusual bug(s), like suddenly not being able to type, try refreshing the screen with F5. You will be able to pick up the game from where you left off. Saving shouldn't be necessary as the game automatically saves in-browser as you play. But if you're switching browsers or using incognito mode, you can save by typing \"SaveF\". The game will create a txt save file for you, which you can upload with \"LoadF\".<br/><br/>Stuck? Try \"hint\". Really stuck?
