You play as Ardra, she is adorable and has learning  disabilities, so play nice, don\u2019t mock her name for being weird. Say  that it is cool that her name is the same backwards and forwards. I also  probably should say that this game is a tiny bit disturbing and  violent\u2026 and weird. Don\u2019t play this if you are a child. <br/></p>\n<p>Some pause menus in games can be really great, <strong>if you are going to quit the game make sure you use Esc</strong>, do not press alt-F4, or close in any other way.<br/></p>\n<em>Ludum Dare Page</em>\n<p>Music by ZapsPlat and InspectorJ </p>\n<p>Sounds by ZapsPlat\r\n<em><em>\n</em></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T07:36:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/849/849ce9781a7f0cc729d7a3fb3f07df13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["She Wrote"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
