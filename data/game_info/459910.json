While this jam was 48 hours long, I unfortunately would not have time on the second day, so I had to make it all in barely a day (Rest In Peace sleep schedule).</p>\n<p>This was also the first ever game jam I participated in, and the second thing that I finished that can be considered a playable game (the first being a meh Pong clone). I'm kind of a noob if that isn't obvious.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall, it was a fun experience, even if pretty tiring.</p>\n<p><strong>Note<br/></strong></p>\n<p>In hindsight, I kind of stretched the theme pretty hard, as very little is \"two\" other than the two circles and two explosions caused by them... I thought the polygons all having odd amounts of sides would \u00a0make it interesting. I hope it still fits the theme!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tools<br/></strong></p>\n<p>For reference, this game was made using Godot 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 (update released while I was making this haha). All the art assets were made by me, except for the fonts. The only audio effect was made using Bfxr. Images were a mix of Inkscape, Krita, GIMP and even MSPaint.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Combo font</li><li>Everything else</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this game you control two circles that try to spin around the mouse cursor, following it. You can presss LMB, Space or Enter for them to cause small explosions, RMB or S to slow their spinning speed for a bit and MMB or A to become a giant and just enjoy destroying everything for a bit.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the enemies stop spawning (this only seems to happen on the Web build so I'm not sure what the problem is), so R may be pressed to spawn 100 more. It's rarely needed, fortunately (stops being fun by using it...).</p>\n<p>Each explosion damages the polygons by 1 vertex, and every few odd numbers they'll become \"weaker\" by turning into a polygon with less sides. Not that special. When enemies are destroyed, they also cause an explosion depending on the remaining vertices.<br/></p>\n<p>If you let the space between the spinning circles briefly hit a polygon, without letting the balls actually touch it (one way to do this is by going over them) an explosion will be caused in that location and again, it kind of scales with the number of vertices. This is made easier with the slow-mo ability.</p>\n<p>The mega ability is simply a fun thing. Makes the circles immune to damage (caused when they touch a polygon) and scales the circles up, applying what I explained in the last paragraph almost everywhere.</p>\n<p><em>This is unnecessarily long. The game is really simple, however I'm bad with wording. You should figure it out in a few seconds.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Bugs<br/></strong></p>\n<p>It was made in a hurry, so there are some things here and there. Very rarely, the game may freeze after losing, for some reason. There is also a small margin between the UI and the right side of the window... The others are pretty small, shouldn't affect gameplay that much.</p>\n<p>I swear the first two only started happening while I was preparing to export.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mandatory please don't mind any possible typos as my native language isn't English.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:35:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e94b58a15218425703dcda9c0a4fe7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rodrigo Gameiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
