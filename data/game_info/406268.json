My approach here was to try out a few techniques that I've recently learned, in a simple game setting. It was quite an enjoyable process, one that I'll likely do again - albeit with more advanced features!</p>\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n<p>- Windows, 64bit</p>\n<p>- 1080p screen</p>\n<p>- OpenGL-capable GFX card\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:53:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc36abe9da92fd4c90e5e1836f6ecf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s0lly"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
