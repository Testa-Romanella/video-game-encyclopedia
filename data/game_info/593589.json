Thermals are also moving with the wind and have a lifecycle before they burst and a new one spawn somewhere else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition if there is a wind, ridges also produce lift if you fly close enough.</p>\n<p>Race \"start\" spawns at certain time and players have an opportunity to\u00a0 fly trough a set of waypoints, competing with each other (or for personal best).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also customize glider to find optimal configuration for you play style. Make it faster or turn tighter to utilize more lift.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>How it works<br/></p>\n<p>Game implements socket.io and communicate to a node.js server hosted on a Heroku platform\u00a0\u00a0server. Server handles communication between clients and share position, customization data and messages.\u00a0\u00a0There is no limit implemented on amount of players that can be connected, however I have put a\u00a0minor limit in frequency data is send by each client to prevent flooding the server, after all its a free account that hosts a server. \u00a0This was a first time I tried to implement such thing (and to make a multiplayer\u00a0game in general)\u00a0so things will probably\u00a0be polished later on for the next jam.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>If server is inactive for a longer time, it takes few sec to boot it up on first connection. Simply refresh browser if you see the offline message.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So far what has been done\u00a0</p>\n<p>26/04/21 Multiplayer works\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>simple flight physics</li><li>glider configuration\u00a0</li><li>wing flex in thermals\u00a0</li><li>landing\u00a0</li><li>thermals synced in multiplayer\u00a0</li><li>glider config synced in multiplayer</li></ul>\n<p>29/04/21 I have opened a server for testing, a demo race is created to test basic functionality, wind that moves clouds need to be corrected for network sync</p>\n<ul><li>Basic race and notifications</li><li>Moving icons on the screen</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Final phase will be to draw more flight area and to create a correct\u00a0\u00a0mesh colliders for mountains.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>will see how far can I make it till jam deadline as am doing all this alone, all assets have been created in Blender, icons in Xara</p>\n<p>Audio effects are royalty free sounds\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d4af60e92b36b47703f028e9b16cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bpremus"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
