The map is inspired from Shellbrook and based on DEM map.</p>\n<p>The map is anhydrous ready, western canada wheather and equiped with several industries to explore FS22 new features. Hotspots were conserved to keep the map userfriendly.</p>\n<p>Two grain farms and one dairy. Two sell points, one in town the second one in a private farm.</p>\n<p>You start the game owning the main farm and two fields. No machinery but your grand'pa has given you a valuable gift. If you sell it you should be able to buy some equipment to start your career.</p>\n\n<p>Some credits to Elk Mountain Modding , TPF, Crooked Creek Modding for the mods used and Forward Agricultural team for testing.</p>\n<p>Pictures show:</p>\n<p>Farm 01</p>\n<p>Farm 02</p>\n<p>Dairy</p>\n<p>Sell points in town</p>\n<p>Grain sell point and more on farm</p>\n<p>Livestock</p>\n\n<p>Please keep the download link in the group page.
