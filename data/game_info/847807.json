I know what you're thinking. ''Ghost's don't exist.'' hmm? Well you just never saw one because I'm so damn good at my job. You're welcome! Wait....what...who is that???? Muhahaha it's me Jerry. And today I will catch you Dustin. Your stupid dust wont help you now......Muhahahaha In Sweet Dreams two players face off against each other inside a kids dream world. In this cat-and-mouse style game, one player takes the role of Dustin and the other the role of the ghost Jerry. Jerry tries to catch Dustin while Dustin can shoot ghost killing dust that kills Jerry when he walks into it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make the hunt more interesting there are two Power-ups that can be found in the map. 1. A spinning top that reverses the movement of the oponent 2. A lollipop that gives a speedboost when cosumed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now, best of luck and may the better player win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T17:47:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28a/28aa3d90b17b7bec9b09f323120fae9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SenorSmeaguel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
