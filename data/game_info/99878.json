All art and lettering was hand-drawn (or smooched), music played on my ukulele, and the sound effects were recorded quite uncomfortably in my closet. </p><p><em>HOW TO PLAY: Click inside the game's frame so that it responds to input, then hold down each player's pink \"Kiss\" button simultaneously to start the game. Move left and right and kiss to try to hit the other player with as many airborne smooches as possible.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38c/38cc1cb65453baf6681a620402a085ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["carolmertz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
