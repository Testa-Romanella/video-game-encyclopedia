Travel through space as an astronaut and collect the space crystals! Hop from planet to planet to collect all of the crystals. Each Planet has its own environments and challenges to get the crystals and back to the spaceship. Use the space bar to jump. The player character moves on its own but the player controls the jumps.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I started off creating the game by white boxing each level. It allowed me to have an idea of where everything would be and how the level would work overall. I then began to add assets and waypoints for the player to follow. The assets prove to be difficult due to the differences of shape between a plain white cube and a rock. After I added the assets, I needed to adjust the level to work with the assets and to balance the difficulty. I then continued to test it until the levels were complete\u00a0</p>\n<p>Assets credited to original artists from the Unity Asset Store\u00a0<br/>All art was not made by me, all the art came from the Unity Asset Store<br/></p><p>Assets by @Moonflower Carnivore (Unity Asset Store),\u00a0Thomas Mathieson, @</p><p>Mitchell(Youtube), Harry Edwards, @Sons of Earth Games, Pawel Margacz, @lowpolly (facebook), Ebal Studios, Night Sound Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T05:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/881873a300d15f82c64e4b58253403f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["wilhite stephanie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
