It is a game created with simple shapes and colors where you play as a Square in an enclosed arena and you have to use the zero gravity physics around you to hit spawning enemy shapes and try to eliminate them by crashing them against the arena walls! When an enemy hits the arena wall it dies and you get a score with a small increase of time which makes your Square bigger before you eventually die. Get the highest possible score without dying!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca0e3e48db6915247eb7fbc1dbbbedda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DarkroomLab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
