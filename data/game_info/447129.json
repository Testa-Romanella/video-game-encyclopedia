I'm happy with the test and it is something I would like to eventually come back too.</p>\n<p>While how it currently looks isn't representative of the narrative I wanted, I did want to base the narrative around the Rudston Monolith in North Yorkshire, England which is the tallest Megalith in the UK. It is thought that the stone has to be at least\u00a0as deep in the ground as it is tall, and I like the idea that this Megalith extends down infinity and has a whole network of caves and subterranean areas that have their own environments all with their own strange goings on.</p>\n<p>The prototype has the typical FPS controlls of:</p>\n<p>WASD - To move</p>\n<p>Mouse - To look</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>There isn't currently no way to quit the game from with in it, so to quite you'll either have to use ALT+F4 to force quit\u00a0or ALT+TAB then manually close it by right clicking in the toolbar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T02:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bd/5bdbad600ebefa1867257d8dced4ea86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blackhyphen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
