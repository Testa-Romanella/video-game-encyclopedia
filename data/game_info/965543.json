{"id": 965543, "slug": "4-the-elements", "name": "4 The Elements", "name_original": "4 The Elements", "description": "   4 The Elements is a 2D Action Platformer inspired by the best games of this genre from the 90s. Switch in real time between the four elements of nature to overcome challenges, acquire new abilities and defeat powerful bosses in beautifully crafted thematic stages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   You control each of the four elements of nature, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water, that for some mysterious reason find themselves trapped inside a magic crystal and forced to share the same body. By switching between the characters on the fly, you will be able to use their different attacks, movement and abilities to face enemies, solve puzzles and unveil the truth behind their mutual predicament as they fight to escape from their imprisonment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Walk beautifully crafted environments that were formed by the elemental chaos raging within the crystal, each created from the clash of two of the primary elements. Traverse through Ice, Magma, Mud and Smoke as you face the challenges each of these stages present.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The 4 elements have much of their power sealed away and scattered across these hostile domains. Look for the runes that contain their essences to empower the elements with new abilities. They will be essential to conquer the obstacles that stand in your way, both environmental and foes alike.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   Speaking of foes, at the end of each stage, a massive creature awaits. They serve as guardians to the 4 crystal keys the elements need in order to release themselves from their prison.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the places they inhabit, these mighty beasts too were birthed from the coalescence of elemental forces and wield that power with unbridled fury. As such, each will present challenges that match and make use of their domains. Combine your skills with the knowledge and abilities acquired on the path to their lair to fell these giants and claim their keys.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T04:01:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/788e9ddff5a7354844e40a0cc43d295d.jpg", "website": "https://www.mitogames.com.br/en/4-the-elements-en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mito Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Mito Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
