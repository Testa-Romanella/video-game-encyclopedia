If you receive an item it will yield no bonus until you rest and identify the item.</p>\n<p>As you delve deeper and deeper you will encounter more difficult challenges. <strong>Your Age, Total Bonus, and Fatigue Status determine your chance of success in all encounters.\u00a0</strong>Occasionally you will find higher or lower level encounters outside what you would normally see at your depth which can yield powerful items or massive amounts of experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Both \"Rest\"\u00a0and \"Delve\" will age your character one year</strong> as they traverse the undereath. <strong>At age 100 your character will automatically die of old age!\u00a0</strong>Spend your time wisely and see how far you can push into the earth.</p>\n<p>Happy travels.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Created in Unity</p>\n<p>Music created by myself using Bosca Ceoil:<br/>https://boscaceoil.net/<br/></p>\n<p>Sprites modified from open source Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup tilesets:<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles</p>\n<p>Background from Stealthix:<br/>https://stealthix.itch.io/various-backgrounds</p>\n<p>Font is Alagard modified with TextMeshPro package in Unity:<br/>https://www.dafont.com/alagard.font</p>\n<p>Sound effects are generated through sfxr:<br/>https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c70/c70eeb9c51ce9fe521a5319b30641ae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bjromano"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
