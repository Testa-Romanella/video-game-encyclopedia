{"id": 97921, "slug": "upon-a-darkening-flood", "name": "Upon A Darkening Flood", "name_original": "Upon A Darkening Flood", "description": "<p>\n<strong>A horror tale of the Revolution on culture, heritage,<br/>\r\n\tand the anxieties elicited by a strange library.\r\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey say that after the Revolution, some great aristocrats went awry,\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tand took part in depraved, occult rituals.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey don't understand why Lord D was among them.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tWasn't he an ardent defender of the Revolution?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere's talk of terrible events occurring in his personal library.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey say he didn't like it, never went anywhere near it.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey say \r\n\t<strong><em>he couldn't master it</em></strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a Lovecraftian horror tale set around a fictional revolutionary time.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThe story is around 12 000 words long.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt's partly a visual novel, partly Twine-like interactive fiction. Though there are visuals and sounds, there are no sprites, and the emphasis is on the text.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is probably not a very pleasant, well-written or constructed piece of fiction.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThe original idea dates from quite a while back, and it's been weird to commit to it after all this time. Hope it can still be enjoyed in some way!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNaNoRenO notice: this is an IntRenAiMo entry\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis story was submitted for NaNoRenO 2017, but it isn't a regular entry: \r\n\t<strong>it hasn't been fully made within March 2017</strong>. I have reused an old unfinished short story which was already ~6000 words long.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSince participants were encouraged to submit works merely \t\t\u201cfinished\u201d during March under \r\n\t<strong>the IntRenAiMo tag</strong>, I thought it'd finally be the occasion to try to turn this half-finished story into interactive fiction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nRelease history\r\n<p>\n<strong>May 4th, 2017</strong>: in the Post-NaNoRenO build, fixed typos, fixed the text position bugs during typographic effects, added a few words and precisions in the ending notes and credits menu. This is the final and definitive version (v1.3)<br/>\n<strong>April 13th, 2017</strong>: Made a few minor tweaks in the Post-NaNoRenO build (v1.2)<br/>\n<strong>April 12th, 2017</strong>: Uploaded an improved Post-NaNoRenO build (v1.1), with proper credits, ending notes, better editing, GUI, and the last scene rewritten!<br/>\n<strong>April 4th, 2017</strong>: Created the page, uploaded a rough NaNoRenO build (v0.99)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm no artist or musician, so creating this story wouldn't have been possible without the work of talented composers, photographers and sound enthusiasts who made their work freely available under Creative Commons licenses.\r\n\t<br/>\n<strong>Please refer to the Credits menu inside the game</strong> for detailed attribution resource by resource, with links and additional commentary!<br/>\r\n\tIn the meantime, please let me shortly thank\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026For the background pictures</em>:<br/>\r\n\tMarie D.
