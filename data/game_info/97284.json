It's CCG meets action RPG, combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.\r\n</p>\r\nA Real-Time Card Game\r\n<p><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.</p>\n<p>Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.</p>\n<p>Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.</p>\r\nA Character-Driven Story\r\n<p>A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge. <br/>The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin. Instead, they brought monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns. Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, <strong>The Land of Glass</strong> tells stories that are both personal and small\u2014it is a character study first and an epic fantasy second.</p>\n<p>Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.</p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<ul><li>Four campaigns with eight different characters</li><li>A unique take on deck-based card games</li><li>Character driven story</li><li>Nine different types of magic</li><li>Hundreds of cards to collect</li><li>In-depth crafting system</li><li>Stained glass art style</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70a6d7142b360caddbdb97c51750ab5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dual Wield Software"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
