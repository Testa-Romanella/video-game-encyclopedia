As more distant civilizations rally to the Final Star, it was only a matter of time before a hostile alien race would arrive to seize control. The Final Star Armada, tasked with protecting its people from invading forces - has failed. You're all that remains of the fleet, and only an alliance with the dangerous (and untrustworthy) mercenary guild can get you the upgrades needed to fight off the invading forces.\r\n\r\nFinal Star is a shooter from Dynamic Voltage Games. It features non-linear gameplay with dozens of missions, a deep story, and role-playing style upgrades. You'll travel the vast galaxy completing missions to power yourself up. The action is intense and you'll need to plot your mission course carefully to ensure that your ships are powerful enough to contend with the massive alien fleet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-24T21:11:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec9d754a89a71b5a0eb9206cd551a292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
