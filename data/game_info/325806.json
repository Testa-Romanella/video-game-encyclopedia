She despises \"the cool kids\".\u00a0Now that she has to spend some time with them, will she find it easy to connect with them?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The themes are friendship\u00a0(or a lack thereof), hate and misjudements.</p>\n<p>I made this game reflecting upon myself from when I was in middle school and I envied the kids who were happier than me. I was very hateful and unfairly judgemental of them. Little did I know, they actually weren't so bad.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING !</strong>\u00a0\u00a0This game contains:</p>\n<ul><li>Bullying</li><li>Strong Language</li><li>References to Drugs and Alcohol</li><li>Sexual Themes</li><li>Bright Colours</li><li>and lots of teen angst</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse: Left &amp; Right Button</li><li>Keyboard: Z/Space/Enter, X and Arrow Keys</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What changed in version 1.1?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Not much, a couple of bug fixes: one where pictures wouldn't load, making the game unplayable, and one where the wrong music played,\u00a0starting with the second half of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f5e296f4ab11723f7d599cd0069454.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Laureste"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
