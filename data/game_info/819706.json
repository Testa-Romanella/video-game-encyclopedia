I messed up the coding on the rudder/turnning. Will be disabling the ability to turn right until I fix it\u00a0:X prob after the Jam/event.</p>\n<p>Update 1: Game is buggy, careful when <strong>moving/turning at the same time</strong></p>\n<p>**How to play: **</p>\n\n<p>Drag dice onto the White Squares onto the Ship.</p>\n<p>Not all Squares need to be filled.</p>\n<p>Once you're satisfied, you can press GO on the cup on the left.</p>\n<p>It'l do each action one at a time and then pass turn to the Enemy AI.</p>\n<p>Goal of the game is to see how many levels can you pass while managing enemies and your Dice economy.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Thank you for visiting my Game Jam Game.
