Here at NOAS, we pride ourselves on providing customers with non-lethal produce at the market rate. And we've decided to hire none other than YOU to be our brand-new Picker!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, that's right, you are the bridge between our fruits and the bellies of the populace. We really liked your ability to integrate yourself vertically <em>and</em> horizontally in our gardens. It was just like our founder Chaff Beanzos when he was first starting NOAS. Asking bold questions like, \"Why can't I eat whatever I want, when I want?\" \"Who's stopping me from making a company?\" and \"Why don't plants eat people? It's only fair!\"</p>\n<p>So, as part of our Fifty-Second Bi-Annual Ludum Dare hiring push, we've decided to give you the chance to shine! Welcome, to our state of the art gardening facilities. We know you'll wear the title of NOAS Picker with pride.</p>\n<p>Happy picking! And remember, if you could pick, you'd still pick NOAS!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>All rights reserved. No, not your rights. Snickering at homophones for NOAS in the context of picking is strictly prohibited. All Pickers are responsible for own food, health, and funeral costs. NOAS bears no liability in case of bugs, crashes, or insects.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, E to harvest plants.</p>\n<p>Plants can only be harvested when ripe, or... a little overripe. Those ones might take a few tugs to get out of the ground. The flavor of lethal intent also tends to stick around, so just try to get 'em before then, OK? OK.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f82431d750e69805b6514dc3d2e6a1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Judissimo", "I.C.N."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
