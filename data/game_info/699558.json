It helps you calm down a bit with the satisfying particles. Click and hold the buttons to make the particles appear. Stop holding to make them disappear. I'm so sorry that there's no music. I will try to add some but other than that, the game is done. Enjoy :).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8a/e8af6fca711691ced5dbeccbf06a4e8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["HyStErIcAlJeDi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
