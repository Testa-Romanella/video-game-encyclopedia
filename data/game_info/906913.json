We found only their graves.</p>\n<p>Star after star, world after world, where there had once been thriving societies, only crumbling stone and skeletons remained. The pattern was clear: any species that becomes interstellar undergoes civilizational collapse and extinction soon after. If we cannot discover the cause and prevent it, we will surely be next.</p>\n<p>Thus began Project DARK COSMOS: a program to send robotic probes to as many alien ruins as possible and find a common factor in their demise. You are one of these probes. Once launched, you will receive no further communications from Project Command. You will drop drones to explore alien ruins, examine artifacts, and send your data back to Headquarters until you can no longer function. With luck, your data or another probe's will ensure that humanity does not become another headstone in the graveyard of the cosmos.</p>\n<p>We don't know how much time we have. It may already be too late. It will take you years to reach even our nearest neighbor, years more for your data to reach us. Perhaps by the time it does, we will already be gone. You carry out your mission nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use your limited supply of components to outfit drones and explore alien ruins.</li><li>Manage power and stun, avoid, or outmaneuver hostile wildlife to collect as many artifacts as you can.</li><li>Procedurally generated maps and artifact data give each alien ruin a unique layout and history.</li><li>Game automatically saves after every ruin exploration.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c31fdcf58b0a7c3ff549d90fea5cda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["BeamBrain"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
