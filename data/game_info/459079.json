Cave systems are generated and filled with enemies and loot for the player to explore. Inspired by\u00a0Spelunky by Derek Yu, the adventurer in Endless Grotto comes equipped with sticks of dynamite to help get out of tough situations. Also... Watch out for the mini-bosses that are lurking at the end of\u00a0<em>special</em>\u00a0levels!</p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to try to get the highest-score possible by collecting coins scattered around the grotto floor, or from killing the hostile creatures. Survival is key! You have 4 hit points to begin with and they can decrease quickly if you're not careful. If you die, the adventure ends and your points are reset. However, you can restore your health by defeating the mini-boss located at the end of every third level. Be smart, calculate the risk vs. reward, and good luck!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left &amp; Right Arrows: Move<br/>Z: Jump &amp; Double Jump<br/>X: Throw dynamite<br/>Down Arrow + Z: Drop down through platforms<br/>Up Arrow (Hold) + Z: Perform a super-jump</p>Links<p>@DavidF_Dev | Website | GitHub\u00a0| YouTube | LinkedIn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d6/8d60163b1eb56d9a2ab2549767eca094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David F Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
