Technicals deal bonus damage, but do not refresh the Rush<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Critical attacks can be landed at the -end- of a Rush, triggering another Rush)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(This is mean.)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Casie cannot be one-shotted in any situation: she now 'gates' especially powerful attacks, surviving at 0 health, as long as she had more than 0 to start with. Theoretically she can be one-cycled, but only theoretically<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Machine Guns now generally apply a status effect called \"Chasing\", temporarily lowering enemy accuracy. Attacking the same target with a machine gun multiple times increases the weapon's hit rate significantly<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Rust Worm now makes a noise when you meet him<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 The Field Guide has been buffed to give you even more information. You can now examine enemies directly, with Shift, during battle (as long as you have used the Field Guide on them at least once)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examining enemies also gives you information on their status effects<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Examining Casie also gives you information on the current state of her armor<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Examining Jack gives you a headache<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 The broken form of Jack's Support Weapons now can be scrapped directly into the Repair Kit<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In general, more enemies drop items that can be repaired into Jack's Support Weapons<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Zenny values in general make more sense<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Enemies are much more predictable and generally deal consistent damage, but also have larger 'movesets' and can do more things to impede you<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Lots of options to customize the amount of information the game gives you:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Complex Combat Readouts give you more information on hit rates<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dialogue Autoscroll<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Subtitles<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Controller support<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Multitap' support: all connected controllers affect the same cursor<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 No I'm not changing this, this really is intended behavior<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0People say 'its not a bug its a feature' all the time but no, I'm serious, this really is a feature<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Support Weapons can be used instantly, as long as Jack is ready, instead of having to wait to fill up the bar<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 A combat log is available on the Pause menu (P) at any time.

In the original prototype, when Casie used a weapon, she put it back at the very top of the feed, and in some circumstances this item would continuously be 'shunted' by new item spawns until it was unreachable. In the new version, items simply don't spawn if there are enough items in its way, giving items already in the feed priority.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2022 Some of the goofball shit from the original demo (ie. Grenades, Drill Arm, Grenades) are not integrated yet. They will return<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some of it has been replaced with other goofball shit, like Crates.
