Please provide your honest opinion, it really helps me know what I can improve. Who knows? Maybe I'll update it someday?</p>\n<p>The controls are easy, the main menu is controlled with arrows and enter, other menus with the mouse. The actual game just uses the arrows.</p>\n<p>I'd highly suggest checking the help page, and the person who helped me make the AI, he's basically made the game work lol.</p><p>Low Tier Game Jam #2:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/low-tier-jam-2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:51:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84a937fe1ac506fa98ee638702e4c9ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SeaFerret"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
