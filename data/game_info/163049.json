You then go on a quest to get revenge. I know there many bugs in my game but I don't know how to fix them and I'm not going to. I made this game for school. It is possible to complete. When you shoot, it may look like you are only shooting right but the actual laser goes in the way you are facing. You can walk through crates. I was going to make this so you can play it through the browser but it didn't work so yeah. It's only for windows. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd3/dd32b1db5b426ee928be39a7a36a988c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlyingTurtle"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
