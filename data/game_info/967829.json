You've set up camp and stayed there for a few days, but your food and water supply is diminishing rapidly. You must embark on a challenging adventure. You need to overcome your fear of the dark, forests, and, of course, taking another's life.<br/><br/>If you want to gather food, you'll have to search various houses all across the country. When entering a house, be cautious of other dangers. Pay close attention to what you eat and drink, as consuming tainted food can be fatal. Instances have occurred where people accidentally ingested ethyl alcohol, thinking it was water.<br/><br/>When you run out of food in regular conditions, you'll need to resort to hunting. I understand it's tough to pull the trigger in such a situation, but right now, it's the law of the jungle - either you hunt or be hunted.<br/><br/>If you're wondering what happened to people, they transformed into a different kind of creature long ago. These creatures have a strong desire to kill anything that lives. You must be cautious of them as they can swiftly end your life.<br/><br/>However, there are people who fled cities and villages. They armed themselves and established their camps and bases. As I've heard, they even took control of an entire village in the north of the country. You must watch out for them, as they possess a significant number of powerful firearms, in addition to melee weapons. A bullet from them can cause a wound that's difficult to heal, depending on its destructive power.<br/><br/>All in all, there seems to be no end in sight to this situation. Hence, you must heed some advice:<br/><br/><ul><li>Prioritize acquiring essential items: food, water, some form of weaponry, even an axe.<br/></li><li>If you manage to survive for an extended period, establish a secure base. Ensure it's sturdy because unwanted creatures entering your base can spell significant trouble.<br/></li><li>Gather everything you can lay your hands on, as you'll need it.<br/></li><li>Hunt only as much as needed for sustenance, not for pleasure.<br/></li><li>Ammunition is highly valuable; safeguard it. Producing ammunition is challenging, but it can be invaluable for escape or self-defense.<br/></li><li>When confronting bandits, always carry a bomb, just in case.<br/></li><li>Try to restore a semblance of normalcy to your life, even if only for yourself.</li></ul><br/>Stay cautious at night, as they are active both day and night, and they are consistently aggressive.<br/><br/>With that, I wish you the best of luck and welcome you to the Infection Crisis.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T04:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd578f85424b2d9491ef763bbf7c04c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 482, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Branko Stojisavljevi\u0107"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BJS Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
