{"id": 372110, "slug": "candice-the-anglerfish", "name": "Candice the Anglerfish", "name_original": "Candice the Anglerfish", "description": "<p>Candice the Anglerfish is an arcade-style shooting game where you play as a deep sea anglerfish named Candice. You shoot bubbles at enemies and at the fish you consume for food.Your main source of food is the Hatchetfish, a silvery fish that cannot harm you. You need to consume a certain number of these every level to maintain your health and advance to the next level. Swimming depletes your health. Shoot bubbles at the hatchetfish in order to consume them. They will also release a heart you can collect by colliding with it, which is worth even more health. Some enemies also release hearts.</p>\n<p>Most other creatures you encounter are enemies. The vampire squid and blobfish are able to shoot bubbles at you, so watch out for these or you will lose health. Colliding with enemies also reduces your health.</p>\n<p>Other friends include other types of anglerfish. They won\u2019t hurt you, and you can shoot bubbles at one in order to choose it as a mate later in the game.</p>\n<p>There are currently 30 levels and three endings, but more may be added later. Pause screens and loading screens have educational info about the deep sea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:11:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/547/547a8608ed05acfd5cf47e75226a35b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ExistentialTerror"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
