Together they have maintained balance since the dawn of creation on our beautiful planet. But the current industrialisation of our world, the pollution of our oceans, our soils and our skies are disrupting this fragile balance and causing chaos and imbalance in our world. The link thus broken, our 5 spirits have disappeared, imprisoned in all this pollution, plunging the colours of our world into darkness. You will play as Fuku, a young Kitsune messenger and you will help him in his journey.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credit (Team 18 - Godai Journey)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>GemeDesigner:\u00a0Yukihiro Kameda<br/>Programmer:\u00a0Shunsuke Tachi, Hasanpour Nariman<br/>Designer:\u00a0Sun Jinghan, Bajart Elodie, Berote jordane</p>\n<p>AudioManager: Copyright (c) 2019 Kan Kikuchi<br/>Released under the MIT license https://github.com/kankikuchi/AudioManager/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</p>\n<p>Match3:<br/>https://github.com/daltonbr/Match3</p>\n<p>BGM: Music Atelier Amacha<br/>https://amachamusic.chagasi.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T12:29:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b4/0b475a6bcef74d9a3ab43046f8c1ee18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rimuuuu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
