Intelligent Qhess encourages this notion.</p>\n<p>Intelligent Qhess is here to elevate the meaning of Chess. It is a new beginning in the world of intellectual thought.</p>\n<p>In Intelligent Qhess, you will have to reconsider all of your preconceived notions about Chess, Imagination, and Life.</p>\r\nGetting Started\r\n<p>To begin playing, download, unzip, and run Intelligent Qhess.exe. The menu and gameplay of IQ are controlled completely by the mouse. On the main menu, you will have two sets of options: player modes, and gameplay settings.</p>\n<p>Choose a suitable player mode: IQ can be played by 1, 2, or 0 people! If you are playing by yourself, I recommend having a match against CPU L2 to start with. But nothing will ever be more strategic then the wit of another human opponent... When you are ready, click on the \"BEGIN MATCH\" button!</p>\n<p>The game will begin immediately. On your turn, simply click on a piece to select it. Then click anywhere on the board to attempt a move. Further, more detailed instructions may be found in the README.</p>\r\nLinux Compatibility\r\n<p>You can play this game on Linux using WINE!</p>\n<p>If you are using 64-bit Linux, and the game starts without any sound, you might be missing 32-bit libraries for your default sound device. As a common example, if your setup is PulseAudio on 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu, you can install 32-bit libraries using the apt-get utility:\r\n<br/>apt-get install libpulse0:i386</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game design, music by Nikki Bee<br/>\r\nAnnouncement voiceover is by Decky Coss<br/>\r\nGraphics and sound effects by Clickteam<br/>\r\nTitle art ripped and edited from I.Q.: Intelligent Qube<br/>\r\nMade in Clickteam Fusion 2.5<br/>\r\nMore detailed credits are available in the README.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da336d98f93b9f802fa50573ef1fd5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nikki Bee"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
