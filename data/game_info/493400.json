If you enjoy the game, please consider purchasing the full game running on Windows.</p>\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>\n<p>Get Your Klix on Route 66 is a Qix inspired game that is themed around Route 66. You get to travel the 12 cities that you hear\u00a0in the famous jazz R&amp;B standard made popular by Nat King Cole.</p>\n<p>You take on the role of WIX who must gobble up as much real estate as possible in every level, so that the evil\u00a0KLIX is left with nowhere else to roam. Each city in the game\u00a0is inhabited by this unique \"Mother\" of a beast in the form of a Route 66 sign. Also, in the level are HAX - road signs that will deal you splitting headaches on your grueling journey, and BRIX - representations of officers out to give you a speeding ticket!</p>\n<p>Claim an area more than the stated threshold to advance to the next level. Next, there are no lives in this game... you start off with 10,000 points. Every death however deducts a certain amount of points, and more is deducted with every subsequent mistake you make. So don't die, too often!</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>To move WIX, use the arrow keys. Avoid KLIX, HAX, and BRIX on every step of your journey from Chicago to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Use CTRL-X to commit suicide in the game when you find yourself trapped by the blue-colored BRIX - these naughty fellas will erase the lines you draw. So, watch out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T16:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c499a693af3db77d6128a733324755.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gameswarp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
