The aim of the game is to rotate the cubes on the left and recreate the layout on the right. Think of it as a much easier version of the Rubik's cube :)</p>\n<p>Click the cubes to rotate them: Left mouse button to rotate on the Y axis - right mouse button - X axis, middle mouse button - Z\u00a0axis. Hold Shift while clicking to to invert the rotation's direction. Hold Ctrl and move the mouse to control the camera and view the layout from different sides. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Press Esc to return to main menu.</p>\n<p>In the options you can choose the number of rows and columns as well as change the cubes' texture.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T05:51:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5ae47f35168b772a8af840d3c335bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yatchan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
