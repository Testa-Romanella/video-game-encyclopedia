{"id": 391400, "slug": "drake-hollow", "name": "Drake Hollow", "name_original": "Drake Hollow", "description": "<p>Welcome to The Hollow, a blighted and dying place, and home to the Drakes.</p>\n<p>Drakes are the vegetable folk native to these parts, and they need your help. They\u2019re hungry, thirsty, and need a place to sleep. They can literally die of boredom. It\u2019s on you to save them. Build gardens to provide them with food, wells for water, and yoga balls and puppet shows to keep them entertained. Even treadmills and solar panels to generate power for Tesla coils and electric fences, as you will quickly see they need some protecting...</p>\n<p>The Drakes aren\u2019t the only residents of The Hollow - The Feral have overrun the land, looking to shred anything happy or good. Battle them one-on-one with a wide array of weapons ranging from tennis rackets to nail guns, bring your friends to lend a hand, and build your defenses so you can take them out without lifting a finger.</p>\n<p>Travel from region to region, season to season, taking the Drakes and their village with you. Each region is over a square mile of territory to explore, dynamically generated and populated with each passing season.</p>\n<p>You must balance your time carefully. What supplies are most crucial at any given moment? What does your village need? Metal from the supply caches to build your defenses, or crystals from the blighted regions to grow your Drakes? Prove that you\u2019ve got what it takes to help the Drakes and take back The Hollow.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T01:11:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/466/46610ce32e69a7b3711ee8717c6d17eb.jpg", "website": "https://www.drakehollow.com/", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 917, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 34, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["The Molasses Flood"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CD PROJEKT RED", "The Molasses Flood"], "esrb_rating": null}
