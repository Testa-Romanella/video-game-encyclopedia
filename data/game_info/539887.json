A harpoon. A world on the edge of sane numbers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Warning: Shaky effects can lead to discomfort, more than in a usual first person game].\u00a0</p>\n<p>Floating point precision errors are something that many game projects have to deal with. It usually starts as\u00a0a small jitter, a shaking animation, a foot not quite connecting to the ground. The further you move away from the game world's center, the more obvious it\u00a0becomes. Models can deform, physics simulation might suffer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've always seen a certain charm in these kinds of errors. So I made a short game about it. Here, I fake a world drifting away from the world origin the more the player damages it. As it turns out, causing FPE for real leads to\u00a0issues that I couldn't work around. Unity is also very good\u00a0at mitigating floating point errors, which limits their visibility.\u00a0 Therefore I exaggerated them beyond reasonable scale.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/floatingpointl1<br/></p>\n<p>To speed up development, I've made use of two store-bought assets.
