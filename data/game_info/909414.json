A mutual friend of theirs decides to help them test the game. There's optional dialogue in the game if you really want more context, but what more do you really need for a game like this? The game is 20 levels long in total, so it's a quick play if you want something short, sweet, and hopefully a little bit challenging!\r\n</p>\n<p>The game in basically its entirety has been sitting on my hard drive for nearly three years for some reason. I decided to spend a weekend sprucing it up a little with sound, music, story, and slightly updated visuals. What was initially supposed to be simplistic placeholder art three years ago struck me as charmingly minimalistic in the current year, so the art has remained extremely blocky and basic! This game has a much different feel than the other platformer I've worked on, so I'd be curious which of the two styles people prefer and why. If you happened to have played both or either of the aforementioned platformers, please leave a comment with your thoughts! Either way, as always, thank you for playing!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f0c36d451a0192ed771cab47ac8ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
