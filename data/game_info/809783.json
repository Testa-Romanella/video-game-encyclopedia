Like SFcave?\". I went home that afternoon from work at about 3pm, and this was the result by 2am the next morning. This could be the only game that I have ever completely finished.<br/>To run this on real hardware, unfortunately it will require a full 32k VZ300 due to me dumbly putting the screen buffer at $E000 for whatever silly reason. It wont run on a 24k VZ200. <br/><br/>&lt;0-5&gt; : Set game speed.<br/><s>\u00a0 : Start the game.<br/><q> : Up.<br/><br/>Written in C, compiles with the the-then current version of Z88DK in 2002, being v1.2.\u00a0\u00a0 Will not compile correctly with the current version due to VZ library changes over the years.<br/></q></s></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T11:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d736eb697f641f1568aaa13af5a081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bushy555"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
