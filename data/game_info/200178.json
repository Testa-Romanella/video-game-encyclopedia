{"id": 200178, "slug": "the-fallen-crown", "name": "The Fallen Crown", "name_original": "The Fallen Crown", "description": "<p>The town of Lorem was a peaceful place, a place where visitors from all over the kingdom of Zorn could gather to rest. Safeguarded by the royal family\u2019s sacred crown, the town had been protected for many generations. The king wore the crown with great honor, until one day a blanket of evil enveloped the kingdom. The evil sorcerer Viphus attacked the kingdom out of an uncontrollable lust for power. A great war ensued as a result, causing numerous battles to be fought, day in and day out, over the next decade. The soldiers of Lorem fell one by one against Viphus\u2019 evil mages, as her magical powers overpowered their feeble retaliation. The army slowly crumbled beneath Viphus\u2019 magical forces. As the war waned to an end, Viphus placed a dark curse upon Lorem as a last resort and disappeared from the battlegrounds. Only one soldier remained standing in the aftermath, the king's honorary knight and the town\u2019s last line of defense, Rythian. After barely securing a victory, the town of Lorem was ruined and left without their king, who had died trying to protect the sacred crown. While in hiding, Viphus sealed the crown away in the treacherous dungeons beneath Lorem.<br/></p>\n<p>Lorem remains vulnerable against the curse without their most valuable possession. Viphus now lies in wait for Rythian to rise once again, reclaim the fallen crown, and lift the curse from his hometown of Lorem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f112a52f269e4e7267518319384abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Couch Potato Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
