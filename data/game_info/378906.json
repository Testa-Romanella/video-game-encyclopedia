Although they're pretty high up, and it's difficult enough to reach the moon, so you probably won't have to worry about those.</p>\n<p>- The damn game changes it's behavior depending on what resolution and quality you're playing on. I built the game on 2560x1440 resolution (fullscreen &amp; ultra quality), so it probably works best with those settings. However, I've tested a few other resolution settings, and these are the ones that are still playable (meaning, it's still possible to beat the game, but it's a biiiiiiit harder because you're slower and your jump is weaker. For this reason, I added a cheat key, which increases your speed and your jump power if you press it! Key is indicated in the pause menu. ;3c)</p>\n<p>WORKING RESOLUTIONS (If you for whatever reason actually play my game \u00a0and you find other playable resolution settings, please list them in the comments! Or don't. I really don't care.)</p>\n<p>- 1920 x 1080, Medium Graphics, Fullscreen</p>\n<p>-1920x1080, High Graphics, Windowed</p>\n<p>- 1600x900, High Graphics, Windowed</p>\n<p>That's pretty much it, I guess.
