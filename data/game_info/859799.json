I want to keep working on this, but I didn't have time to implement the theme-relevant part, which was that every 10 seconds, a new criminal commits a crime and tries to escape the island. You have to catch them and send them to jail. The most fun part right now is driving around and hitting trees and street lights. Probably works better in the desktop build. Also, sometimes car does SPOOKY FLOAT on HALLOOOWWEEEEEEEN!\u00a0 OOO OoOoOOOOOOOoooooooOOoOOOOOOO.... Spooky! :fearful: Enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Spacebar is gas pedal</p>\n<p>A/D to steer</p>\n<p>S to brake</p>\n<p>CTRL+R to respawn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T07:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f5138980962113bb2b46d3e59bb6e4b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Helmersoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
