{"id": 4347, "slug": "dirt-showdown", "name": "DiRT Showdown", "name_original": "DiRT Showdown", "description": "<p>DiRT Showdown is not a traditional racing simulator of the DiRT series. The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don\u2019t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2012-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/23d/23d78acedbb5f40c9fb64e73af5af65d.jpg", "website": "http://www.codemasters.com/uk/dirtshowdown/", "rating": 3.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 218, "owned": 4027, "beaten": 151, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 199, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 148, "ratings_count": 426, "suggestions_count": 530, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 426, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
