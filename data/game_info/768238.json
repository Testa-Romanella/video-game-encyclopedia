The residents welcome furkin who have had trouble dealing with both furkin and human society. Most of the time they are counseled, patched up as needed, and sent on their way.\u00a0 Occasionally though, someone is dropped on their doorstep who is beyond the usual trouble. The latest stray is just that and threatens to break apart the close-knit family.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Production notes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is not your traditional visual novel with sprites and backgrounds.\u00a0 All the characters are embedded in the scenes, there are no sprites other than dialogue side images.\r\n</p>\n<p>Images created entirely in 3D\u00a0using Blender, Unity and Substance Painter.\r\n</p>\n<p>The furry characters were created from scratch in Blender by Shunaka.\u00a0 The backgrounds and sets are Unity assets.\r\n</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0 This release is safe for work though it does contain some strong language.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Update plans</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-Continue polishing the current build with a major emphasis on finishing this story.\r\n</p>\n<p>-Start image block out of the second story of the series.
