Rockets, Plasma gun and the Gravity Beam are also used in the same manor with left and right mouse button.<br/><br/>You start the game with 15 lives and each time a ball crashes ito the city one life is lost. Reaching zero balls will also reset any ball bonus and clear all bonuses currently on the screen.<h3>The Graphics</h3>The first time the game is run it will test how fast it can render the graphics and set a graphic setting. The graphic setting can also be changed in the option menu and lowered by the debug mode.<h3>The level Generator</h3>There are 12 different playfields with a maximum of 555 points grid. A filter are applied depending on how many levels you have finished in that game. Next the 145 different kinds of bricks are speard out over the grid and player may also stop the process by clicking with the left mouse button.<h3>The upgrades</h3>As you finish a level you will gain a skillpoint that can be used to unlock power ups and upgrades. Unlocking a different kind of ball will make it possible for that specific power up to spawn when a brick is destroyed. For each 10.000 points earned in a single level there will be a bonus skillpoint (Get the multi bonuses). Playing the game on a high difficulty will also add skillpoints before the first level.<br/><br/>With no upgrades the game works nearly as old classics but it can easily be changed by the player with the upgrades. This may change the game from casual to more of a action shooter.<h3>Cow progress</h3>Spinn the ball, collect multi bonuses and complete other tasks to unlock all 8 difficulty levels and secret option menus.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T04:21:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84b146aa6e3dfca4ea9f70f18f818d4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin eriksson"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Martin eriksson"], "esrb_rating": null}
