Highly recommended: https://exphrasis.com/</p>\n<p>Which Way consists of an interactive adaptation of the short story \"No Matter Which Way\u00a0We Turned\", from the collection Song for the Unraveling of the World by Brian Evenson\u00a0(2019). This short story describes the horror of a community confronted with a young girl\u00a0whose front half of the body is unobservable. If anyone attempts to position themselves\u00a0in front of her, she inevitably pivots. The story ends with the girl abandoned to herself,\u00a0barricaded in an abandoned house, while the protagonist constantly dreams of this\u00a0unseen face staring back at him from the sky.<br/></p>\n<p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Maheux and Gabriel Tremblay-Gaudette (re)present the horrific strangeness of\u00a0this story by making use of the affordances of the video game: the anxiety of the organic\u00a0glitch, the frustration of not having access to the face despite attempts to get closer, and\u00a0the renunciation to which this situation leads. The project thus takes the form of a three-dimensional game with a first-person perspective where the player tries in vain to position\u00a0themself in front of a 3D model of this impossible corporality.</p>\n<p>Design, coding and music : Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Maheux<br/>Adaptation and testing : Gabriel Tremblay-Gaudette<br/>And a huge thanks to Brian Evenson for his support.<br/>Light sound asset by\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Glaneur%20de%20sons/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T16:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a1/7a1d5c21d72d6200a728fd7664ef65dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Death Orgone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
