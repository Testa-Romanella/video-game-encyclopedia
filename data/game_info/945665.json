They rove their world in search of small treasure chests called geocaches.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But, not everything in Geoterra is as idyllic as it sounds. There have been weird reports of creepy monster-cats attacking the peaceful denizens. Do you have what it takes to join the Geocats and return peace to the lands?\r\n</p>\n<p>This demo version of Geocats is our showcase.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We have been working very diligently since 2020 to finally bring everyone sample of what we've been working on, and what to look forward to as we continue to build.\r\n</p>\n<p>We make all of our own art, music, and sound-effects. We've even made our own typeface! It's called Qix Mono, and is free for anyone to use in their own projects if they like. At Nonaco, we utilise and support as much non-proprietary software as possible. Geocats is created in Godot, the free, open-source engine, and all our assets are created with the help of programs like Krita and Gimp.\u00a0 We're also open source!\r\n</p>\n<p>Our goal is to create an entertaining game that makes our friends, families, and fans happy.<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to Geocats, enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T10:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/826e4db013a7092ed3e34394d683255b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Waotzi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
