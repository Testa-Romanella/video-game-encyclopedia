I claim no rights to the Xevious game or title, those rights belong to Bandai Namco. I think I'm in the clear on that, right?</p>\n<p>The game is definitely not finished, and neither is the title. The bomber crosshair currently does nothing, there are no ground enemies to shoot bombs at (or any other enemies other than the \"gunner\"). Please give me suggestions, I am open to any feedback or help!</p>\n<p>Made using Defold.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00b/00b15398dd1cb3fc2aa4a759f66cf77f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roly Yuva"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
