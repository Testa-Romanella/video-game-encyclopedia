{"id": 111157, "slug": "murdershifters", "name": "MURDERSHIFTERS", "name_original": "MURDERSHIFTERS", "description": "<p>\r\n\tIn the crowd, amongst the throng of citizens lie a killer who looks like any other... Your job is to track him down, and eliminate him.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> MURDERSHIFTERS takes place in a world where MURDERSHIFTERS roam the streets. These vile creatures kill their victims and then utilize their energies to shapeshift into them. <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> Every MURDERSHIFTER is affected differently by MURDERSHIFTING. It can range from becoming slow and fat to becoming red with power. Use these side-effects to differentiate MURDERSHIFTERS from the crowd, and take them out with as few innocents caught in the crossfire as possible! <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> It's Where's Waldo meets Hitman! Play now! <br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> P.S. If you have trouble in windowed mode on the Windows executable, try fullscreen mode, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tP.P.S. The Unity3D Web Player version above is the post-LD version, with minor bugfixes but no changes to gameplay. There is also a post-LD version available for download. I highly recommend that one over the normal one as it fixes a few annoying (but not gamebreaking) bugs. The source code is not post-LD; It still contains the bugs.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db031874e06033a59868c60948a4580f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Chaoclypse"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
