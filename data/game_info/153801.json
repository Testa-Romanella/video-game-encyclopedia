This is done by combining different abilities to create complex reactions. For example, one player can light an enemy on fire. While that enemy is burning, a second player hits the target with a gush of water. The combinations results in a cloud of steam that scalds the surrounding enemies.</p><p><strong>Developer Notes</strong><br/></p><p>Development on Aigilas is complete.
