The Object of the game is to fill the grid provided with a mixture of charged magnets (with positive/negative poles) and blank dominoes (green with two neutral poles). Be sure to satisfy all the clues around the grid, as these indicate the number of positive and negative poles contained in related rows and columns.<br/><br/>Of course two like poles can't occupy adjacent squares, as they would repel. But neutral poles don't repel; so they can be next to any other pole. Sounds simple. But it's still challenging enough to give your braincells a work out.<br/><br/>GE Magnets is available on all your iOS devices and features:<br/><br/>\u30fbSingle universal binary for iPhone/iPad<br/>\u30fbUnlimited puzzles, so you'll never need to buy another puzzle book (or make an in-app-purchase)<br/>\u30fbUnlimited undo/redo, for ease of backtracking<br/>\u30fbAutomatic error checking/highlighting<br/>\u30fb8 modes of play and GameCenter integration, so you can check how buffed your brain-cells are", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1c/d1c28ba260b6c1b9013907ef46e5edf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["thug-zh.com"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Mike Jones"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
