It's very famous for being one of the first video games ever made. I have remade Pong, but with better graphics, and with power ups! Power ups enable the user to totally destroy the computer the user is playing against! It's really fun, and could be played for hours. And the best part? It's totally free. Pay what you want for donations, but if you just want the game for no cost, you have that option! I hope you guys really enjoy it. This was also made in Ludum Dare 31 in 48 hours.</p><p>Source Code</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/dae364672d59ff9285907fca7becf5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gandalf1209"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
