I've wanted to switch to FOSS software to create my games for a while, so I took this opportunity to learn how to use Godot. And it's been also my first time doing a 3D game by myself, so I'm sorry if everything looks a bit shabby :S Anyways, it's been so much fun and I hope you enjoy it &lt;3<br/></p><p><em>**The game is not complete yet, e.g. you'll see there's no music or sounds. I'll update it in the upcoming days with more levels to play and stuff :3 I'll also add Windows and Linux versions and a link to the public repository so everyone can check the project.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d76edf2dbe606f79b2e2ad1ce2b38fbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nbmach1ne"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
