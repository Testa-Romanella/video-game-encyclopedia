This game intends to relate that theme to joining two characters with different limitations together. You play as Subject 7, a purple blob with the ability to split in two,\u00a0 with the unfortunate catch of not being able to fully control both parts when separated. There is a 5 level tutorial and a 10 level campaign, which takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:17:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c5/0c5d45cdb7e38604b0f34abaef6333fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jaydeDash"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
