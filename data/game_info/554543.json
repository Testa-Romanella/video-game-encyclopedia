You were on your way to the old high school in the posh HQ Residential end of town when your car broke down. Might as well look around while you're here...</p>\n<p>This was made with assets by the HQ Residential designer NotLonely. I'd planned to create the house using these HQ School assets, but ran out of time... Unfortunately it's missing a lot of proper notes, sounds, music and even enemies right now, but I'm working on it!\u00a0\u00a0This is my first game, please be kind! I also had to really rush this, 25min to deadline! The Caretaker\u00a0will be back in a more polished state!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de1/de1c06a0053378dd8734ca39292cef1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Judgeking"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
