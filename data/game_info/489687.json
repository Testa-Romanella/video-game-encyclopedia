I searched the internet and found that im using http address while this website is hosted on https server. I'm extremely sorry for the inconvenience as i cannot re-write the code due to lack of time. So I must remove the highscore system in the webgl game :(. however it is included in the standalone application :).</p>\n<p>BUT THIS WORKS FINE WITH THE STANDALONE GAME. I'VE INCLUDED THE FILE TOO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE FILE.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e4/5e43bb4d0fbed61655166a9affcfd6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Velkur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
