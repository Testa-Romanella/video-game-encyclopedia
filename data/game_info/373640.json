Just jump and dash and have fun.<br/>\r\nAzure is a game that I first developed as a regular assignment for Intro to Game Development class in the second semester of my freshman year, and I decided to continue working on it for my final project. <br/>\r\nInspired by Celeste and Hollow Knight, this game is a quite simple platformer. Players need to control the heroine named Azure to overcome obstacles in front of her.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Main features -<br/>\r\nClassical Platformer Mechanics: I implemented the double jump and dash mechanics into this game, and players basically just use them to solve problems.<br/>\r\nTraditional Eastern Aesthetics: Art is another main feature of this game. I tried to reach the level of Chinese ink paintings but failed a little bit, but still, I believe this game looks adorable.<br/>\r\nWell-made Level Design: I'm not boasting this. Both my professor and my peers praised it. \"It is difficult but you still have the motivation to continue playing.\" One of my classmates said.<br/>\r\n- Yeah, these are the reasons that you should download and try my game. It's free so why not -<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDon't ask me what's the background story because I don't even know. Just created an adorable character and let her jump around.<br/>\r\nProbably not adorable enough cuz my drawing skill isn't that good, but I did spend tons of time on art and programming. I believe the game is free of bugs after a couple of playtesting, but just let me know if it has.<br/>\r\nBy the way, the majority of this game was solely developed by myself within a month. Some other parts were done with the help of other people, and here are the credits:<br/>\r\nBackground music done by Snake<br/>\r\nLogo &amp; Capsule Image done by Danfeng Yang<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnyway, enjoy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T22:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fae/faeb0d24fac722d567c0bbe69b208de1.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/newstate3", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["New State", "Hongke Luo"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New State", "Hongke Luo"], "esrb_rating": null}
