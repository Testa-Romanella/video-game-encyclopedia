He was last seen by a woozy cow at his farm (located in the lovely place of Bummertown), raking dead rats on his porch.<br/><br/><br/>- The red circle marks the spot where Bedford was last seen. Ignore the upside-down bird, it\u2019s not a glitch, only a photographic illusion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is what the cow had to say:<br/>\"Yeah I saw him, standing there in front of his hut raking something. When all of a sudden the usual glitch* occurred that pushed Bedford's rake out of his hands and into the sky. All I remember after that was Bedford's red face, his barrage of curses, and him walking into the woods.\"<br/>*We, as the developers of the wonderful Bummertown, do not agree with said statement. There are no glitches in this town.<br/><br/><br/>- The cow that saw it all (not the glitches though, as there are none).<br/><br/><br/><br/>We are searching for brave souls who are willing to go head first into what maybe a dangerous* journey.**<br/>*In reality, it won\u2019t actually impose any danger to the player at all.<br/>**Technically, it\u2019s more of a task than a journey.<br/><br/>If you think you have what it takes to find Bedford, then it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll have to do the following:<br/><br/><ul><li>Collect items and use them as needed.<br/></li><li>Talk to imbecilic characters.<br/></li><li>T\u0336a\u0336l\u0336k\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336i\u0336n\u0336t\u0336e\u0336l\u0336l\u0336i\u0336g\u0336e\u0336n\u0336t\u0336 \u0336c\u0336h\u0336a\u0336r\u0336a\u0336c\u0336t\u0336e\u0336r\u0336s\u0336.\u0336<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles.<br/></li><li>Talk to animals.<br/></li><li>Start a bar fight.<br/></li><li>Search for treasure.<br/></li><li>Watch an old lady dance in a bikini.</li></ul><br/>As creators of Bummertown, we can confirm that it is a magnificent place, filled with joy and happy faces everywhere you look; it\u2019s a digital heaven.
