It doesn't take a long time to complete the game so that it doesn't get too boring and long. As it was made only in 3 days, it is not so developed, but I hope it will be fun to play anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:55:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/58710128e58f276559a40e69b5fa2aa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lukix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
