The embedded game does not work on ChromeOS, but HTML does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is not yet finished, but here's the premise so far:</p>\n<p>You wake up in a strange place with no memory of your past. Jump, shoot, and laser enemies on your way to find answers!</p>\n<p>Yes, I know that you can glitch inside the platform insanely easily. No, I do not care(I do, I just don't know how to fix it). If you find another glitch, please report it in the comments.<br/></p>\n<p>Watch me make this game via the devlogs at:\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\n<p>If you reach the boss area and then restart the game, the enemies will not have arms. You will need to restart the game again. No, it's not a glitch. It's a feature. Yeah. Definitely.</p>\n<p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move, space to sprint, and click to shoot. Use \"r\" to reload. Press 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to switch guns. Go left and right after killing all enemies to progress. Press \"g\" to open music volume settings</p>\n\n\n<p>(Spoiler: at the end it will say \"Insanetaco2000', but that's just my username on scratch)</p>\n<p>Description from the scratch project:</p>\n<p>I was sick and tired of all the platformer games on the featured page, all with the exact same character, and the same code, and all the descriptions stating\u00a0\"100% of code by me\" when it's obvious they stole the project from someone. So, I actually made a platformer with almost 100% of all code by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T11:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2edf467e1b83af3e3a4449da1bccab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["derpygamer2142"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
