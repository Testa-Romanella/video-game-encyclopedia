Andre and Liselot must combine their unique abilities to make it through each room together. Along the way they\u2019ll meet a cast of characters including the foreman, the chef, a food inspector and a general who wants the factory to supply drinks to the military, now engaged in a new war.<br />\nSINGLE-PLAYER CO-OPERATIVE PLAY Liselot can double jump, push small crates for Andre to climb on and talk to other characters.
