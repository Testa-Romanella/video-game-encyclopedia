No saves or stored data. Game is pretty short anyway\u00a0:)</p>\n<p><strong>Soundtrack EP album is\u00a0available for free</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>on my Bandcamp page</strong></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed it (or if you have any constructive criticism)\u00a0<em>please leave a comment below</em>.\u00a0That will definitely encourage me in creating more games!</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS ABOUT HOW TO PLAY:<br/></strong>Even though a bit more advanced than the average text-adventure, <em>the text parser is still quite limited</em>.\u00a0Try to use <strong>simple sentences and generic verbs</strong> like: <br/>\"use <object> with <object>\" or \"open door\" or \"go\u00a0door\".<br/>Also, the environment/setting is quite small and limited, so no need to write the usual \"north\" or \"east\" to move around\u00a0(you definitely won't have to create a map for this game!).\u00a0Just go with the generic: \"walk\" or \"go back\" or \"go <place>\".</place></object></object></p>\n<p>Special thanks as usual to my family for their amazing support.\u00a0<br/>Special thanks also to my awesome supporters on <strong>Patreon</strong> -\u00a0www.patreon.com/andreabaroni\u00a0<br/>In particular:\u00a0<br/>Lucian Hardy, Matthew Bucci, Inyang Akpan, Ryan Swaims, Maurizio Maltoni.<br/>Super special thanks in particular\u00a0to Fabio \"Scourger\" for the QA testing and text corrections!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T04:31:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc4498d31b8ac634d31ccb8887c70e82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Cyberleaf Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
