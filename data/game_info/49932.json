The song describes a young girl named Katyusha. Who is Katyusha? Let's meet her.<br/><br/>Born and raised in Smolensk, hometown of the song's writer Mikhail Isakovsky, young Katyusha becomes an adult by facing humanity's worst fear: World War II. In 1940, standing by the Dnieper river, Katyusha says goodbye to her boyfriend who is leaving to join the Russian army. Her boyfriend fights in Russian battles during World War II. They exchange letters together but haven't seen each other for one year.<br/><br/>In 1941 Germany invades Russia. Katyusha lives near the borders. Her boyfriend advises her to leave and save her life. Katyusha leaves but her feelings won't let her abandon her boyfriend. She wants to find him. So she decides to leave on the east and join the Russian army. That would be her only hope of finding him back one day.<br/><br/><strong>A Platform/RPG full of emotions</strong><br/>Katyusha is a fast-paced Platform/RPG which contains lots of emotional moments. Take control of Katyusha as she has to survive in Russia during World War II. The combat system includes melee combos and ranged weapons, among with stealth kills. Real World War II weapons will be used for this purpose.<br/><br/>A levelling system allows you to gain xp, level up and train Katyusha to learn new skills. Katyusha's skills include healing, movement skills and weapon skills. Checkpoints are symbolised by mailboxes as Katyusha sends letters to save her progress.<br/><br/>Katyusha can also use her grey steppe eagle to attack her enemies. Her relationship with the eagle depends on her actions. You can choose to feed your eagle or order him to attack. A bar under the health meter will show your relationship with the eagle, which will affect his response in battle. Also, the eagle can gain xp, level up and unlock new skills.<br/><br/>Both Katyusha and eagle can level up and unlock new skills to attack their enemies. Katyusha will also use vehicles (including the 3 famous Katyusha trucks which were used during the war) and meet famous iconic people from World War 2, which either lived or died during the war. They will train her to reach her ultimate goal. Survive the war and meet her beloved.<br/><br/>Many of Katyusha's skills will be revealed in the future.<br/><br/><strong>Real-life letters</strong><br/>When Katyusha's comrades are killed they drop letters. Katyusha will also find letters from German soldiers. All those letters are real-life experiences that soldiers wrote in paper and sent to their families during World War II. We also accept letters from any of you kept from your relatives. You send them via email and those will be posted, either with the original poster, or using alternate names. Photo of letters are required to prove the identification.<br/><br/><strong>Development</strong><br/>Katyusha's development started in September 2017.
