Here, many people work together \u2013 you'll make friends in no time.<br/><br/>In this game, you're tasked with finding humans whose hearts have been invaded by a parasite called \"Rubyuk.\" You'll be operating in the human residential area, searching for Rubyuk.<br/><br/>Your job is simply to locate who is hosting Rubyuk... of course, with the aid of a specialized sensor. No expertise needed. Just set it up and power it on.<br/><br/>Be warned, though, the sensor's signals are unique and might cause nausea or hallucinations in some. But don't worry, it's all safe. After all, every job has its hardships, right?<br/><br/>\"Days like a nightmare\"? Can you read that graffiti on the wall? Ah, Arabic, I see. I didn't even recognize it as writing. My mistake. Oh well, it's just graffiti, probably written out of boredom.<br/><br/>Get ready for a little mental challenge. Once you've placed the sensors and powered them, check their readings to deduce which person hosts Rubyuk. Be aware, there are unnecessary Rubyuk mutations that might also show up on the sensors.<br/><br/>\"Queen\"? Just a rumor, nothing to worry about. It's like a queen ant, nothing more. Besides, a Rubyuk queen wouldn't be in a place like this.<br/><br/>Now, to start. Please pull the three sensors into the investigation area...<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>This game is a logic-based challenge set in a small room where you must guess which person is infected with the parasite Rubyuk.<br/></li><li>The atmosphere is eerie, with a few jump scares.<br/></li><li>The game progresses from DAY1 to DAY7, with levels up to DAY4 serving as tutorials, and DAY7 featuring a special custom mode.<br/></li><li>The rules are simple, but the introduction of different Rubyuk variants complicates the deductions.<br/></li><li>While you can think at your own pace, there are some action elements when enduring the \"Nightmare\" attacks.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T05:35:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f53cef9fd2a56abea878966af1ec871e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["727 Not Hound"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["727 Not Hound"], "esrb_rating": null}
