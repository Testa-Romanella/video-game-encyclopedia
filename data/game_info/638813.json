This effect is cumulative, meaning that if one player plays a two and the second also do it, the third one will take 4 cards and so on.<br/>Four (4): The next player is skipped.<br/>Seven (7): The player has to play a second time.<br/>Sota (10): This card allows the player to change the suit on the play.<br/>King (12): Changes the direction of playing.<br/>Joker: Works similar to the two, but makes the next player to take 5 cards instead of 2.<br/><br/>When a player reach 200 points or more, he is eliminated from the game. The last player on the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The points to add at the end of each hand are obtained from the cards that the player has not discarded. For example, if at the end of the hand a player has a one and a nine, he adds 10 points to his total points.<br/><br/>The two adds 20 points and the joker 50.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T04:34:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abc71a83e9af93bfcdc9fbe71b484ad6_MFBlQFm.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Diego Lattanzio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Diego Lattanzio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
