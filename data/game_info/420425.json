Not all could go and not all wanted to go. Communities emerged from the people left behind, and each community found its own way to survive on Earth. In this story you play as a lead character in an already established\u00a0community who has difficult decisions to make in order to keep surviving on Earth.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I did not create the images or sounds</em><em> in the story</em>.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab71f5b42cbcd3a38843fb51ea6e44ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Christian Locantore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
