A game in which you use strange objects in your post-apocalyptic world to create even stranger potions, which you can then sell to the strangest of customers.</p>\n<p>BUT!!!!!!! Beware. If you mix a potion improperly, you'll need to add it to the Unstable Mixture barrel (where else would you put it? you're not a litterer, and garbage collection was suspended in the apocalypse). If you fill the barrel up, it's game over!</p>\n<p>You might want to get a pen and paper handy to write down clues that customers give you (they're usually standing there but they're not in a rush, so take your time). As you meet more and more people, you'll get more ingredients and be able to sell more potions. Thank you for giving this game a try!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e583213fbb0bd518bf1457012e90ef7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kristinamay"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
