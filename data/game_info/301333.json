Throughout the maze, you will find creatures that want to steal your wealth. Each creature is defeated by a specific action, walk into a creature when the correct item is selected to perform that action.</p>\n<p>Each level is made up of connected rooms, the doors of each room will open once the room has been cleared of items and creatures. Find the down stairs to proceed to the next level. When you enter a new level, you will find a new item to use. Each level will contain a new type of creature.</p>\n<p>The rooms are randomly generated, you can use the room structures to avoid creatures. Some creatures move at a different rate to you, meaning if you move one tile another creature might move two or three, so watch out.</p>\n<p>Artwork from Oryx Design Lab.</p>\n<p>Runs usually last around 10 minutes.
