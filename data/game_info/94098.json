{"id": 94098, "slug": "astromantica", "name": "Astromantica", "name_original": "Astromantica", "description": "<p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Astromantica</strong> is a hybrid visual novel space opera game about war, connections and making amends. You play as either enemy sides in a war and your goal is to end the war and reconcile with your former ally and friend.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis updated version is a demo made during Stugan. The original prototype with which I applied to Stugan was developed in the course of a month during <strong>NaNoReNo 2016</strong>. Not all core mechanics have been implemented yet, so this is still a bit far behind of what the actual game will be. </p><p>Right now the game is temporarily on hold as I can't afford to keep developing it for the time being. Please consider supporting me on <strong>Patreon</strong> if you'd like to see more of it! I would love to hear any feedback you might have for the game :)\r\n</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>- additional dialogue: Eileen Holowka (@elmahka)</p><p>- main song: Michael Kelly (@garoadmusic)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b090fb71389798b8b3688ec65cffa6c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bitmOO"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
