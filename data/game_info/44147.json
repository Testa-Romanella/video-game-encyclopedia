Dynamic change of day and night will enhance the sense of presence. The rustle of grass and dry leaves underfoot will completely immerse the player in this amazing world.<br/><br/>There are not so many animals in the game. Wolves - your main threat! They fast and dangerous animals, feel you for a mile! There are plans to add roe deer, deer, fox, wild boar, etc.<br/><br/>Well, if you are VERY lucky, you can find a bottle of foam drink in the small house on the lake!
