This game is about a race of Rat People from the Moon wanting to invade the Earth. You play as Donny, a cyborg built by the Earth People to defend their planet.</p><p>The game has 3 areas and each one adds new enemies to make things more challenging. The game has no failure state, it's pretty much about racking up as high a score as possible until the game ends. However, if you lose all your lives, you get a score penalty so you still have to watch out. </p><p>It also has 2 unlockable extras which I wont explain what they are here (you''ll just have to play the game for yourself to see them)</p><p>That's pretty much all you ned to know, the controls are explained in the game.</p><p>If any of you find any bugs or glitches, please contact me immediately so I can fix them. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/4098e7d78b34fbaa357f1907dab6bf39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eezy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
