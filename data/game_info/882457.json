This was the reason that Pluto got kicked from the planets clubs. Knowing that his gravitational field is not strong enough to clear his path of orbit, Pluto teams up with his largest moon, Charon, to hit off any object that decide to obscure his orbit!</p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>Charon has a fixed orbit around Pluto.<br/>So you can only use the A and S keys to move Charon Left and Right to block off any objects that might hit Pluto.<br/>If Pluto gets hit too many times it'll veer off its path of orbit and fail his mission!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T17:50:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd381d5d7aec067d142ec7a11373a56e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["amiya lamisha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
