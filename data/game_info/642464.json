It uses a block tower and a series of open-ended prompts and questions representing the difficulty of preserving a message of danger across tens of thousands of years of human history.</p>\n<p>A fair warning:\u00a0this is intended to be a difficult, stressful game, similar in design ethos (and mechanics) to the horror game\u00a0Dread.</p>\n<p>Another warning:\u00a0this game is about the symbols we use to represent the long-term danger of unearthing\u00a0nuclear waste in the future, not on whether it is reasonable for humans to use nuclear power\u00a0to generate electricity. For an even-handed assessment on the viability of nuclear energy as a long-term power source for humanity, you can read through the following report:\u00a0https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/22/6074/pdf\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T07:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8a3ce3d49fd11dc00ba5eb6e1d9f9b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["II!M"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
