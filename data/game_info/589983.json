The purpose of Project Madrigal is to\u00a0combine\u00a0raymarched and rasterized geometry at interactable framerates in the same scene. The downloadable game demo for the technology contains an experience where a player (represented by a rasterized penguin) can explore and interact with a fractal, raymarched world. If you would like to read more about the development of this project or its tech, check out montanamott.dev/project-madrigal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that it is highly recommended that you play the Project Madrigal demo\u00a0on a PC with a dedicated graphics card. While not required, the framerates will be drastically better with a dedicated GPU due to the nature of the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>If you are experiencing low framerates/lag, press\u00a0<strong>Escape\u00a0</strong>to open up the menu, where you can\u00a0<strong>disable SDF shadows\u00a0</strong>to make the game run faster, at the cost of visual quality.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T07:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/929f3b0e7e699d0ed00446d7b8771fb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["montanamott"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
