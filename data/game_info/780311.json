You may also drag and drop platforms using your mouse as you progress the game.</p>\n<p>This green circle is\u00a0your goal</p>\n\n<p>Avoid the red stuff if you don't want to go back a level</p>\n<p><strong>Overview</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Plat For Me, <em>Platform For me</em> or <em>Platform Me</em>,\u00a0was created for Assignment # 10 of my Game Programming Studio class. The goal for that assignment was to teach the various uses of Dont Destroy On Load. I applied what was taught in class to the extreme and created not just a singleton for a few of my scripts, but I also used it to create a short game.</p>\n<p>By taking it to the extreme, I was hoping to showcase that I understood how to properly use the declaration. For example, unlocked platforms, two exist currently,\u00a0are not tracked through any dynamic script but rather through a singleton. The object containing the updated platforms (or not updated platforms) compares itself to the current singleton and if it is a more advanced version it replaces this single instance. If not, as to stay true to the singleton name, the object is destroyed and the unchanged singleton remains as the sole object of its type in the scene.\u00a0Since the game doesn't need to save anything else,\u00a0progress is carried over.</p>\n<p>The main point of the game however is that the platforms remain. There is no fancy scripting pattern used here, they just have a platform script with don't destroy on load and thus get carried over throughout all the scenes.</p>\n<p>This lesson was very beneficial to me as I would have never before considered this game's concept otherwise. My use of singletons was also on the low side prior to this class but I have and will continue to add singletons into other projects for which they seem applicable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T10:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55ea94e3148954bb39805804fa8e5201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pwnzer21"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
