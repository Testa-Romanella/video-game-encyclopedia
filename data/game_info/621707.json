I thought I was the only one. But one thing I knew for sure: society didn't want \"espers\" like us. We were unnatural. Dangerous. This was the height of the \"Supernatural Scare\".\u00a0When the war broke out, I thought I could redeem\u00a0 myself by fighting for my country. I enlisted in the military. So did Charlie. We joined together.</p>\n<p>On one particularly dangerous mission, Charlie was wounded and left for dead. We all thought he was gone. But one night, I heard him in my head. I had to rescue him, alone. No one else knew he was alive.</p>\n<p>Following his voice in my mind lead me to a secret underground base. When I found Charlie, he was nearly dead. But he still had a chance, if I could get him back.\"</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD / left-stick\u00a0 --\u00a0 movement</p>\n<p>mouse / right-stick\u00a0 --\u00a0 look</p>\n<p>left-click / left trigger\u00a0 --\u00a0 shoot</p>\n<p>space / XBox A\u00a0 -- jump</p>\n<p>E / XBox B\u00a0 -- pick up or set down comrade</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>I haven't been able to test the Mac and Linux builds, so I don't know if they work correctly.
