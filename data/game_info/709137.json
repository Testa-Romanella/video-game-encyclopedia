Beat enemies, collect items, and survive to the end, or as long as possible...<h3>Here are some of the main features of this game:</h3><ul><li>A selection of <strong>characters</strong>, also known as 'subjects' to play with and get better with. If you don't like one, play another!<br/></li><li>The select few of <strong>stages </strong>are randomly chosen each time you start a run! With many styles ranging from a desolate deserts to a sentient forests.<br/></li><li>Randomly spawned <strong>enemies </strong>allow combat to never be the same, each stage has a set roster of enemies that the game randomly chooses from and spawns the enemies at random locations around the stage.<br/></li><li>All stages are ruled over by a much larger enemy; each <strong>boss </strong>enemy signifies the end of that stage and is a gatekeeper to the next stage, defeat each boss and their specially designed fight mechanics and intense boss themes!<br/></li><li>The assortment of <strong>over 50 items</strong> to find and collect are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies. Each item has a different rarity, and effect or function. Find out what all of them do!<br/></li><li>The <strong>permadeath </strong>feature ensures you are never playing the same life twice, that can get redundant, so when you die, you may restart as a new subject, or the same one then try again and hope for better luck!</li></ul><h3>Future ideas:</h3><ul><li>More subjects to play!<br/></li><li>More items to collect!<br/></li><li>More stages to explore!<br/></li><li>More enemies and bosses to fight!<br/></li><li>A set storyline!<br/></li><li>And more! Always more! ;)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T04:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d62e02f196aa3153a50f9f20ed3187f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dreamscape Mansion"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Dreamscape Mansion"], "esrb_rating": null}
