The game runs on Amstrad CPC, BBC model B, Commodore 64 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It is a typical text-based adventure of the mid-1980s.</p>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the 1983 award-winning children's novel of the same name by Terry Jones. A number of characters and items in the computer game are drawn from the novel, although the plot is completely different. Jones also directed a 1989 movie Erik the Viking, which was also completely different from the novel, featuring a third plot that was different from that of the videogame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Level 9 Computing"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Mosaic Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
