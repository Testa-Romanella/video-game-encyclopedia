{"id": 915866, "slug": "blu-trivia-game-engine", "name": "Blu Trivia Game Engine", "name_original": "Blu Trivia Game Engine", "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to create your own trivia game? No? Well too bad, because I have created this customisable engine for creating trivia games with -- the Blu Trivia Game Engine, or BTGE. Play with up to four players using controllers. Make your own questions, and play it with your friends or family! Or play by yourself and test your knowledge with the default 80 questions. It's up to you what you do with this engine.</p>\n<p>To modify the questions: open questions.csv with a spreadsheet editor. The first column is the question category; this shows up before each question. The second column is the question itself. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth columns hold all possible answers, and the seventh column holds the number of the correct answer (1~4.)</p>\n<p>To type a comma in-game, use \"[;]\" and to type a quotation mark in-game, use \"[~]\"</p>\n<p>To modify the settings: open settings.csv with a spreadsheet editor. \"Seconds\"\u00a0 are the amount of seconds per round. \"Rounds\" will be the number of rounds per game. \"Title\" will be the name of the game. \"BG Shape 1\" ~ \"BG Shape 3\" will change the background shapes that are drawn by the game. Possible values are \"square,\" \"triangle,\" \"hexagon\" and \"line.\" Anything else will be interpreted as \"none.\" The next four rows allow you to change the music in the game. Setting \"Preserve\" to TRUE will make it so that used questions won't re-appear in future games until the game runs out of questions to use. Set \"Use Xinput\" to FALSE if you don't plan on using Xbox controllers. Finally, you can change what colours the answers appear in based on what colours your controller's buttons are.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T12:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e3294a7e94e8a920e4695f9c5f85371c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tailfeather Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
