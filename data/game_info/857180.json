I found the bomb-est classical/ royalty free joints I could find. Information is credited in game. There is one titled \"She Rested\" that gives a nice Fall-Out vibe. <br/><br/>I plan on doing a series on this concept, so check back soon for new locations. Since the war and treat of nuclear catastrophe, I thought it would be nice to catalog beautiful areas. Maybe one day people will need them to remember how things were.<br/></p>\n<p>Please comment on what you think could be improved to make this a better meditative experience.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T10:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b61/b61466d9f2a603c05ff2c887957978f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DENKERj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
