SACRIFICE time. The Obojo tribe has their offering all together but they have learned from the past.</p>\n<p>Just because you throw the offering into the volcano doesn't mean it gets to the lava.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the KING of the tribe, you must ensure the offering makes it to the lava. If the LAVA does not get its offering, it begins to rise up, ready to explode. Make sure to get the offering into the lava before it is too late.</p>\n<p>You can not touch the offering without getting hurt by their spikes, so use your broom to hit them into slumber (retracting their spikes) then push them into the lava before they wake up.
