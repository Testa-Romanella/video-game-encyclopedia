I have included a walkthrough to help a bit with the contrivances of the systems )<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb311dc5260813e82d7860eab7ffebe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rabbitses"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
