It draws inspiration from western fairytales and modern indie games.</p>\n\n<p>The game deals with a girl named Dust as she is sent on a quest to bring bread and pie to a nearby village by the name of Woodpine.\u00a0 On the way she meets a charismatic young traveler who offers to aid her on her journey. \u00a0When they arrive to the village they quickly discover that the village is not as peaceful as it seems. Young children have gone missing in the village, one after the another, during the last few months and as a result the village is in disarray. Will Dust with the help of her newfound friend, solve the enigma surrounding the missing children or will the dark secret of the village of Woodpine be left forever shrouded in mystery?</p>\n\n<p>The game is largely story focused so anything beyond that can be considered extra content to fill out what the story is lacking. There is however some bonus things and multiple endings that can be unlocked by exploration and making differing choices. The game has a traditional JRPG-style battle system with turn-based controls and has a length of about 25 minutes. The game features some mildly violent artwork, so watch out for that!<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you already have RPG Maker 2003's RTP installed, then you can download the no RTP-version, otherwise download the RTP included-version!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:53:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/054/054f4f6217151180265eb1222f3e8e85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["taikinaaa"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
