You are one of the survivors, struggling to find food and resources while demons and abominations rule over the Earth.<br/><br/><strong>Inferno - Beyond The 7th Circle</strong> is an old-school Dungeon Crawler with survival elements. It's made for hardcore gamers and fans of 80s and 90s cRPG.<br/><br/>It's the spiritual successor of <strong>The 7th Circle</strong>. Unlike its predecessor, <strong>Inferno - Beyond The 7th Circle</strong> has a more \"classic\" approach to the Dungeon Crawler genre: you can now save and load the game when you want and if you die you can just reload your last saved game.
