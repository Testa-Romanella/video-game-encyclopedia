Get crushed? Come back as another character randomly and take your revenge!</p>\n<p>---------------------------</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Entire game in one screen\". My interpretation was the game could not generate anything new at all - what you started with (in the screen), was exactly what is in the screen, period.
