Is a 3D single-player, stylish action game developed using Unreal Engine 4\u00a0</p>\n<p> Focusing on an elite firefighter named Blaze, players will have to traverse hellish landscapes, burnout cities and suffocating smoke to dispel evil fire monsters, rescue civilians and put an end to what kind of vile plot unleashed these beings in the first place.</p>\n<p> With high mobility, mind-bending attacks and too much water, players will have to show their style and get crazy if they want to survive and thrive in this adventure.</p>\n<p>Side note: This game was basically a small game jam project in association with MoonRift Entertainment\u00a0that extend into a little less than\u00a0a year's worth of work. This is mostly a solo project but I had additional help from MIN, who basically carried the latter half of development and QA. So it would be beneficial for everyone if you checked them out. They make good stuff.<br/><br/>Min:\u00a0https://mindeveloper.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Moonrift Entertainment: https://itch.io/profile/moonrift<br/><br/>Also shout out to Feyntan/ Lunar Garde for the amazing Stylish Combat pack for UE4 that made development so much easier, you can find their stuff here:\u00a0https://lunar-garde.itch.io/<br/><br/>Lastly, keep in mind this is mostly a solo project made with basically zero prior experience with Unreal Engine and $0 in budget so needless to see, the game can be rough, but I hope you like it well enough</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T08:45:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d2d137b99c94c7e90e037608bf05fdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Min", "Anoymous1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
