Ruebsaat. The Neophyte is a modern witch who seeks to push change into Haven while the Modern Void is the unstoppable juggernaut of progress the world will make.</p>\n<p>The Neophyte playbook is a techno mage in the modern world but has options to touch on classical occult ideas such as alchemy, astrology, seances, and tarot. The flexibility of your tools allows you to access a realm of magic that many cannot fathom or need your help to access. Pushing the envelope comes second nature to you as does the testing of traditions.</p>\n<p>The Modern Void is the representation of the world outside of Haven. Not the communities but the paradigm around those communities. It demands progress, it demands that the old be discarded for the new and unique. With access to a technological realm of mystic wonders the Modern Void brings the scrape of science to the door of Haven.</p>\n<p>Together these two pieces can add a bright eyed neo-magister looking to prove themselves in Haven and a misunderstood world that seeks to grind tradition under its ineffable procession.</p>\n<p>For use with HAVEN by C.M. Ruebsaat. Made by Sawyer Rankin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T06:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b8674de5ebdcd033b9348a68d9448c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
