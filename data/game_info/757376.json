You've only got four minutes to brew and sell as many magic potions as you can! Can you handle the heat? <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overbrewed is a fast-paced potion-making game where you're challenged to sell as many potions as possible in a short amount of time. <br/>Customers will pour into your store asking for certain potions, and it's up to you to give them what they want. You'll find that some potions are more difficult to make than others, but the more steps there are in a recipe, the more points you get from selling it. The faster you get a potion to the counter, the better!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Playable with either keyboard or gamepad. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Developed from scratch in nine days for Godot Wild Jam #43</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:17:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ba/0ba0ebe3c9165c2d3f69438e4965a027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bitron", "VikFro", "Zowie van Dillen"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
