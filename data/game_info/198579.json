The game is a basic 2D platformer, that gives you control of an angry wizard! You shoot and rampage your way through a world of deadly skeletons, undead knights, ballistas, and a Dragon! As you complete each level you're given unique upgrades to choose from to enhance your wizardry and adventure. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/5832db1b31f3d089425428614623b3b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GhtRayleigh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
