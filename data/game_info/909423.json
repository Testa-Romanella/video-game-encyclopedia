But be careful, as these cursed souls will do everything in their power to fend you off. They have summoned spiders and bats to attack you. The cursed have a rotting corpse that can still be harmed, but the longer a soul has been cursed, the more their flesh will have decayed, turning them into ghosts that cant be killed. Your goal is to collect as many souls as possible without angering the cursed by avoiding killing anything. Can you master the art of soul harvesting and emerge victorious?</p>\n<p>- Chattus G.P.
