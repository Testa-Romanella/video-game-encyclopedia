The player is a fisherman and the goal of the game is to collect as many fish as you can. If you can catch all of them, the game will tell you so.\u00a0\u00a0The game also counts how many fish you have collected. There are sharks placed around the water that are shooting out beach balls. Each beach ball will damage your health by 10 points. If you have no health, you will be forced to start over.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>Please play in full screen.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/203/2030327c4dc2c53bb56d19f1d43d5f88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["angelaarroyo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
