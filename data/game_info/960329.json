It's a simulation game where you can get revenge and feel exhilarated in this situation.<br/><br/>The game is divided into several stages, and each stage has missions that can give you a headache, and if you solve a specific mission, you enter the next stage.<br/><br/>Depending on the stage, the map on which the mission is carried out is changed, and I tried to give various fun with interactions using various objects in a new environment.<br/><br/>It consists of missions that are not difficult, so we aim for a play that is not difficult. I made an intuitive game because I thought that the more complicated and difficult the mission is, the more stress it can accumulate rather than relieve it.<br/><br/>Come on [Before Resignation, the day before you quit] and play the game you wanted to play the day before you quit!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T03:45:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/088/0880348c9090d83fd10313670769cc69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BCLASS"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BCLASS"], "esrb_rating": null}
