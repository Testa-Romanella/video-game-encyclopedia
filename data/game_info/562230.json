You play as Bob, Bob is an assassin and his whole purpose of existence is to kill attackers and collect their limbs. Limbs (or parts) in this game are extremely valuable. Use the limbs to exchange goods and services in the shop. Limbs are also used to advance through Stages (or waves) in-game. You must horde enough limbs to advance through stages, purchasing items at the shop will use part of your limb collection, making advancing through stages take longer.</p>\n<p><strong>READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is in pre-alpha, <strong>meaning that issues in gameplay are to be expected and bugs may be overlooked</strong>.
