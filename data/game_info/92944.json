It is inspired by a folk belief about the beginning of spring. When the bear wakes up from his winter-long nap and goes hunting for food, he mustn't see his own shadow, because only then the spring can begin. In the game you play as a bear avoiding your shadows, while collecting acorns.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>WAD / Arrows - move</strong></li><li><strong>P - pause / help</strong></li><li><strong>M - sound on / off</strong></li><li><strong>L - change quality</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Collect acorns</strong></li><li><strong>Avoid Shadows</strong></li><li><strong>Wrap-around from side to side;</strong></li><li><strong>First honey jar gives you 4 points, next one gives you 8, then 12, 16, 20...</strong></li><li><strong>Honey jars also release bees</strong></li><li><strong>Fireflies make one shadow disappear</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e87cb30bb4db8c4cd6244e8ad2122a15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ticklebot"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
