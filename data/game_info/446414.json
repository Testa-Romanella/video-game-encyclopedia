The studio was founded alongside Moudy Hamo, Jack Steele, Stephen Boilegh, and Trevor Osz to make a game using their unique skills.<br/><br/>As a studio,\u00a0<strong>Winterborn\u00a0</strong>was formed to adapt the original tabletop game that the team played for many years into a video game. We all have fond memories and a lot of stories to tell about our time playing the game. Now is our chance to tell those stories and make the kind of games that we grew up playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f44/f444d037f2383041822bf755de43b64e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winterborn"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
