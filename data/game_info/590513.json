But this game was originally conceived for the Commodore 64, and was also available for Amiga. The latter was distributed on a floppy disk included with the Fall 1989 edition of the Compute!'s Amiga Resource magazine, as an executable accompanied with its source code.</p>\n<p>This project is a port of the Amiga version to the Sega Master System using devkitSMS. Playable using standard controllers and Sega HPD-200 Paddles, this game can be enjoyed by 1 or 2 players.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678759968c1b985aff9ea628127bd25e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["raphnet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
