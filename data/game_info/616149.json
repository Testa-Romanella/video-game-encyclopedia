Very simple in appearance and execution, deals with the theme of deconstruction.\r\n</p>\n<p>The theme is conveyed twofold: first, game mechanics and their justifications are removed as levels are completed . Second, the game's appearance does change slightly with each dissapeared mechanic. Read [http://gamejolt.com/games/winter/104141/news/thoughts-on-winter/105340] for extended babbling :).\r\n</p>\n<p>All coding is done in C++ with SDL2 using the mighty gedit. Graphics have been done in-house using the gimp - the only exception being the background picture (a gimp filter of a www.morguefile.com image). Music comes from musopen.org. Sounds were copied and pasted from old projects (I think they came from flashkit.com).\r\n</p>\n<p>Source available at https://github.com/TheMarlboroMan/winter-fgj5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b74b1cf27840518dc1dca62ad76b7594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Marlboro Man"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
