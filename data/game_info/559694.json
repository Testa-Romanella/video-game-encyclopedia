The Game Has Official Been Dead For A Very Long Time, But Today We Decided To Make The Full Game Of It Which Is Not Finished Yet.</p>\n<p>___ABOUT CUBE SPEED RUN___</p>\n<p>Cube Speed Run OR CSR Is A Speed Run Game, What Is Speed Run You Say? Well It's Something Like A Speedy Racing Game But It's Not Actually This. It's Basically A True Speed Run Game. The Game Hasn't Got Any Story But We Can Tell You Something Like The Prequel Of It. The Red Cube (you) Is The Last Cube Ever On The World. The Obstacles (traps) Are Your Fears, They Are Not Actually Your Enemies But It's Your Own Mind, IT'S YOUR FEARS. You Have To Get Rid Of Your FEARS And Move On Your Cuby Life.<br/></p>\n\n<p>___WHY CUBE SPEED RUN IS DELAYED___</p>\n<p>The Answer Is Simple, We Didn't Knew What Else To DO. But Today We Woke Up And Say, We Will Be Making The 3.0 Version Of The CSR AND WE MADE THE FULL VERSION! We Can Say That We Might Never Worked On The CSR Project And We Wouldn't Be Making This Version. But We Had Fun Making It :)</p>\n\n<p>___CUBE SPEED RUN FEATURES___</p>\n<p>With The Brand New Version Of CSR, You Can Now: Select Which Level You Want To Play!</p>\n<p>ALSO BRAND NEW STUFF ADDED!:</p>\n\n<p>-Main Menu</p>\n<p>-Pause Menu</p>\n<p>-Brand New Soundtracks</p>\n<p>-More Options</p>\n\n<p>___NEW MUSIC &amp; SOUNDTRACKS!___</p>\n<p>If You Played The Older Versions Of CSR, You Will Surely Know That The Theme Of CSR Is The Music 'THE SETUP' From Favored Nation So In The New Version Of CSR We REMIXED The Music To Look Something Like Nostalgia!</p>\n<p>ALSO BILLY IDOL HAS ADDED TO THE GAME!
