Once the time limit is reached, the first spy transfers the headset to the other spy, who then has a limited amount of time to look for this intel, while also avoiding the traps. If the intel is found within the time limit, the spy seeking it wins the game. If not, the spy who originally hid the intel wins! Play over and over again to discover all of the hidden parts of each room and experiment with the vast combinations of interactive objects and traps.
