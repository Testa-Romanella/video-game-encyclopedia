Your only way to escape is to be clever enough to avoid all the traps on the way to your only escape... And you may have to beat\u00a0some bad dice on the way !</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>- arrows for moving</p>\n<p>- E and R to rotate</p>\n<p>- T to see explanations / pause menu</p>\n<p>- Escape to quit / go back to main menu</p>\n<p>- Space to cancel your move before it's too late !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goal: in level 1, you have to reach the end of the level without being pushed away. You have to rotate / pivot to match the faces on the walls / floor / ceiling. In level 2, you still have to match the faces that you are given, but you have to survive until the guardian dice are beaten !\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is a little game (more like a demo) I made for the GMTK's Game Jam 2022, which theme was \"Roll of the Dice\". This is my first game jam, and I did this game by myself. I have been working on a personnal project on my free time for one year on Unity, which brought me the experience needed for this jam.\u00a0\u00a0I did everything from scratch by myself during the 48 hours of the jam (code, sprites, sound effects and music included).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm doing this on my free time, but I would really like to work in the game universe. If my work interest you, or if you want to contact me or have more details / information, please use my mail: maxime.schadkowski@outlook.fr</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing ! And thanks for the jam !</p>\n\n<p>PS: Thanks to Thomas, Beno\u00eet, and a huge thanks to Gwen, for their opinion on the game, their tests, their feedbacks and their moral support\u00a0!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/53994e1d771230763715fc4b9f22c1d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Maxime"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
