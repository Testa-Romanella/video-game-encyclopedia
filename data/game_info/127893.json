{"id": 127893, "slug": "keep-lookin-up", "name": "Keep Lookin Up", "name_original": "Keep Lookin Up", "description": "<p>The LD theme was \"Small World\", and as our team spent some time thinking about how we could incorporate that, we toyed around with the idea having a world with limited horizontal movement but with enormous vertical potential. Then we were reminded that one of our friends would always say: \"keep lookin' up\", and that gave birth to this game. The idea of this game is that an old villager and his grand-children were bored of their small world, until a wandering traveler gave them a new perspective.</p><p>Much of the game is still unfinished; we were unable to really flush out the plot and we opted more for the mechanics/assets side stuff instead. Even so, we're really proud of our submission, as it is our first game ever and our first game jam ever :).</p><p>We plan on developing this game further, so stay tuned and feel free to leave feedback!</p><p>Some game mechanic explanations:</p><p>Space: Jump<br/>- The longer you hold space bar, the higher you jump.<br/>- You cannot jump out of a ground attack or if you're airborne.</p><p>A: Attack (Aerial or Ground).<br/>    - Aerial attacks are quicker, but weaker and less range. <br/>      They can be canceled upon landing.<br/>    - Ground attacks are slower, but much stronger and greater range. <br/>      You are completely immobile during the ground attack.</p><p>D: Horizontal Dash<br/>    - Dash to the direction that you're facing/moving.<br/>    - Dash cancels attack animation, allowing for trickier attacks.<br/>    - Can be chained with Vertical Dash and Attack.<br/>    - Consumes mana.</p><p>E: Vertical Dash<br/>    - Dash upward. <br/>    - Dash cancels attack animation, allowing for trickier attacks. <br/>    - Can be chained with Horizontal Dash and Attack.<br/>    - Consumes mana.<br/><br/>Command + Q: Quit the game.</p><p>================================================</p><p>Edit: Windows download is now working!
