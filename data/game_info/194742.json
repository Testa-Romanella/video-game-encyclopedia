It's not great, but I still feel it's at least okay for what my skill level was then. It should be free of any major glitches or bugs, but there are some that I was never able to resolve, like hit detection. There are no updates currently being planned for this. I'd still call in \"complete\" because the only missing thing is a pause function.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d598a35653b05991a822d675be871df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameMerkher"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
