Web version is recommended.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Jeff Marvellous is a 2D RPG about a man trying to find the only thing he had left after the apocalypse - his dog, Casey. It's also a game about a businessman and a secretary\u00a0trying to enact revenge on the thieves who stole their store's most precious item. When their paths meet, they decide to team up to get back what's rightfully theirs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fast battles! Convert enemies!</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>Each battle in the game is designed to be fast paced. You can also convert enemies to fight with you once they're low enough on health; and they'll help you out temporarily for the next battle.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Meet strange friends and foes!<br/></em></strong>The post apocalypse is filled with strange new encounters, from merchants to helpful villagers, who can be friendly or deadly. Or both!</p>\n<p><em><strong>This version of the game is a demo of the first part, approx. 15-20 minutes in length.\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> to move</li><li><strong>W\u00a0</strong>to jump</li><li><strong>S\u00a0</strong>to see next dialogue line, talk to NPCs, interact with doors</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Additional Credits:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Freesound.org</strong>\u00a0270404\u00a0by LittleRobotSoundFactory, used under CC3.0</li><li><strong>Freesound.org</strong>\u00a0346265,\u00a0\u00a0368574,\u00a0\u00a0349179,\u00a0394261 by\u00a0Sirkoto51, used under\u00a0CC3.0</li><li><strong>Freesound.org\u00a0\u00a0</strong>118792,\u00a0237375,\u00a0243701,\u00a0269233,\u00a0269232,\u00a0269231,\u00a0219140,\u00a069509,\u00a0133429,\u00a0191748,\u00a0419341,\u00a0342366,\u00a0368736 used under\u00a0CC0</li><li><strong>Font \"Ranga\"\u00a0</strong>used under the SIL Open\u00a0Font License</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a8de39271a3b7f892d19f2593553e0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tommakesstuff"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
