Find three parts to fix <em>The Shattered</em>, an otherworldly machine that is broken. You're surroundings, though, are not strait forward. Rooms seem to overlap in ways that should not be possible, and the parts you're seeking do not seem to \"exist\" in any particular room, but in any of them at any time. Worst of all, you only have a limited time to find these parts before <em>The Shattered</em>... fails/leaves/gives up?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><strong> - Keyboard</strong><strong><em>W,A,S,D</em></strong> - Movement<strong><em>E </em></strong>- To open doors and give \"Parts\" to The Shattered... though you must not be moving when you do so.<strong><em>Q</em></strong> - Consume a Carrot you've collected... these can improve your stamina<strong><em>SPACE</em></strong> - Teleport a short distance in the direction you are moving. Careful! this can be... strange ;)</p>\n<p>CONTROLS - Gamepad<br/><em>Left Stick</em> - Movement<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>A </em></strong>- To open doors and give \"Parts\" to The Shattered... though you must not be moving when you do so.<br/><strong><em>DPad Up</em></strong> - Consume a Carrot you've collected... these can improve your stamina<br/><strong><em>L1</em></strong> - Teleport a short distance in the direction you are moving.

I needed at least two more days on this project, but have none left as I write this document about to pass out. The game is playable and shouldn't crash, lol!<br/><em>NOTE: You ~can~ \"glitch\" the map... which could be useful for speed runs :)</em></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing and I hope you enjoy No Space!</p><p><strong>Written for the Godot Wild Jam #34\r\n</strong><br/>Using Godot 3.3\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:47:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b80fceede5c492fb8e21d5bc0d4053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
