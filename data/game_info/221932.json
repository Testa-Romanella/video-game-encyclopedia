Thus, you may be moving more than one <br/>row or column at a time, and you may trigger <br/>more than one merge in a single action.<br/><br/>After each move, the game will place a new tile in an <br/>empty space left behind by the action.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the space on the board <br/>is limited, and the game ends when you can no longer move.<br/>Hence, you must manage the free spaces. <br/><br/>I recommend planning for a move that will free two or more <br/>spaces with a single action.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------<br/><br/>simple rules, intuitive gameplay, and difficult to master", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7cf475f09daad9cb19b955e1fc38e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["BULLBITZ"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
