You're exhausted. You need sleep... but where to find it? <em>Sleepwalking\u00a0</em>is a game about hostile architecture and social alienation.\u00a0Travel through a hostile, dreary town and find a place to rest. Talk to the locals, examine your surroundings, and try to fall asleep wherever you can find some peace and quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to play my game. Making it has really been a great experience, but I doubt I'll do anything solo like this again. If you're interested at all in paying money for this game, go ahead and send that money on over to\u00a0the donation page for the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a solo project, but I had a lot of really talented people helping me out.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Christopher Kelsall - Environment Art</li><li>Cooper Garvin - Character Art</li><li>Johnny Wagner - Music and SFX</li><li>Whitman Kent - Logo Design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T07:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708dbc65fea5a88c0530406d5de30f2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Charles Painter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
