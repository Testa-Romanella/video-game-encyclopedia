Developed in part with friends for a school project.\u00a0 The game itself is pretty simple, you traverse the dungeon via the four (five after defeating the floor boss)\u00a0movement options while occasionally picking up gear from Item rooms.\u00a0\u00a0The enemies get progressively harder and the dungeon gets larger too as the player descends through more floors.<br/></p>\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n<p>-Shop rooms are only there aesthetically since we never implemented a functioning shop system.</p>\n<p>-Luck is heavily required to progress through later floors</p>\n<p>-Level up text is not shown, internal stats do reflect a level up though and can be seen at the next combat opportunity.</p>\n<p>-Pressing \"Item\" during combat will not do anything</p>\n<p>-Very limited flavor text</p>\r\nOther Controls:\r\n<p>Press 'Enter' to begin the game once on the start screen\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Press 'A' to exit the death screen</p>\n<p>Press 'Esc' to instantly kill an enemy (You don't receive EXP for doing this)</p>\n<p>Press 'Backspace' to suicide during combat</p>\n<p>Press 'Tab' to open/close a minimap of the floor.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Vinrock - Project Head / Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Crabybaby - Artist /\u00a0UI Designer<br/></p>\n<p>BiggerMac - QA</p>\n<p>Zach1261 - Designer</p>\r\nNote:\r\n<p>The team has disbanded due to COVID-19 so don't expect any major updates (as of now I'm flying solo). I might do some work over the summer if this game gets any traction, but most likely the project is canned.</p>\n<p>Also\u00a0Square-Enix pls no copyright strike the slime enemy.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint: Guard seems pointless since it is often a damage race after descending multiple floors, but it can still reduce the effectiveness of Boss attacks</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9e74b16057463c6ce67aae0cea2239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vincent Li"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
