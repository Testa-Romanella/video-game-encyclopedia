{"id": 746146, "slug": "goonsters", "name": "Goonsters", "name_original": "Goonsters", "description": "<p>Welcome to Goonsters, a platformer-like arcade-y game where you must survive as long as you can while goo monsters called goonsters try to defeat you. Getting on top of most goonsters will squish them, but if they touch you in any other way you will sleep with space fishes! Squishing goonsters will grant you bonus points. The game gets more difficult as the time goes on, so squishing is essential to maximizing your score. Improve at the game and check your local leaderboard to see how far you have come.\u00a0 Study the bestiary to learn how to react to different goonsters.<br/><br/>I hear if you can survive long enough, you will enter the much rumored death mode! See if you can get there...<br/></p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, I own none of the sprites or the music used in the game. This game is entirely free and does not have any commercial purpose.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a42/a4211434a977d68882fe7cb841d87204.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Modulonion"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
