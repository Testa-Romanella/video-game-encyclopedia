Enjoy a science fiction adventure on a remote planet with an amazingly cute hamster! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Challenging gameplay. The enemies, bosses, bullet patterns and controls have been carefully refined to keep you at the edge of your sit the whole time. A true challenge for the most skilled players awaits! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Variable speed. Hold the fire button to reduce the movement speed, this will improve the accuracy of your movements when dodging high amounts of bullets. Release it to move faster and just tap it to fire short bullet rushes while moving faster across the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Combo system. Chain enemy kills before the bar on the top left side of the screen gets empty to accumulate combo points. The longer the combo, the higher the score. If you get hit during a combo you will loose your points. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Score multiplier. Get the energy released by killed enemies to fill the bar located under the combo bar. Once this bar is filled, the multiplier will increase. Getting hit will decrease your multiplier and using bombs will empty the bar, so better use them wisely if you want to get a higher score. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Weapon system. Filling the multiplier bar will also level up the weapon. The higher the level, the higher your fire rate will be. Getting hit will decrease your level and using bombs will empty the bar. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-A soundtrack of more than 50 tracks specially created for the game. Unlock and listen to them with the in-game music player. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Supports keyboard and external controllers (e.g. gamepad or arcade stick).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Note that the video shown here is a work in progress and does not represent the final product.
