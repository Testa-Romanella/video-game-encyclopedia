Block the evil cats from harming your delicate machinery. Simply blocking a cat absorbs their evil energy. If you absorb too much in a short time, you will be stunned and forced to emergency exhaust it all. You can parry cats to dissipate them and absorb no evil energy. Try to survive all 9Cats^2 waves.</strong></p>\n<p>Made for Mini Jam 127<br/>Theme: Cats^2<br/>Limitation: Use a 6 color palette<br/>Additionally I chose to retroactively tack on LowRezJam 2022 to this project.
