It has mixed elements from Resident evil original and remake. <br/>I created this like a gazillion years ago, so there are many mistakes and things. I fixed as much as I could. If you find any bugs and things report them and I will fix them as soon as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently only Chris is playable. Maybe I will remake it in a different engine in future but atm I will not add anything to this version other than fix bugs.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>There are controls in game via the file in the menu. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Bugs and Crashes:</strong><br/>Reloading gun on map can cause crashes, there is no fix for this, in the meantime reload in menu, as this stops the crashes. Save as often as possible as well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-24T15:37:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27091a60020c1f2f9238996f3167a50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["roooodworks"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
