Make your moves in-time with the background music or you'll lose points.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Programmed by Lucas J<br/>Soundtrack by Syndio C<br/></p>\n<p>Submission for Mini-Jam 71.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: Although this is my submission, it's pretty far from a polished game. Due to restrictions in the pygame library, I was unable to sync the music up with the gameplay 1:1, and it's likely there will be game-breaking latency. With that said, it's not impossible that the game will run smoothly for you. If it does, great! If not, I'm sorry, and I hope that sometime in the future I have the motivation to return to this project and find a solution.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b46/b46f732248d0fbd4e29ce79c5d3fc84b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["_peanutButter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
