Dave the clumsy astronaut and his unwilling AI companion GAL must evacuate the station. But they have a problem: Dave doesn't have his keys.</p><p>Fling Dave through the quirky halls of the space station as you and GAL (the station's AI) help him grab his keys for the escape pod. The artificial gravity is broken, so charge up Dave's trusty jetpack and bounce off the walls (or floor - or ceiling!) to navigate through the station's hazards and obstacles. It is an 'Oh shit!' situation, and you have to make the best of it!</p><p>- Every playthrough is different thanks to procedurally generated levels!</p><p>- Find Dave's T-Rex comic books hidden throughout the station - he loves those!</p><p>- Collect stars by finishing the levels like a pro!</p><p>- Other space stations wish they looked this funky and colourful!</p><p>- Chill out to Dave's groovy space music as you play!</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Victor Kim Christiansen, audio designer</p><p>Andr\u00e9 Filthuth, CG artist</p><p>Mathias Fynbo, QA &amp; UR manager</p><p>Malene Henriksen, project manager</p><p>Nicholas Indrehus, programmer</p><p>Mark B.
