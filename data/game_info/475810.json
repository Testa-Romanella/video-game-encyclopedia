This game tests your ability to multitask and navigate through different levels using \"coordinates\" provided.<br/></p>\n<p>\tThe story revolves around a yearly, difficult simulation called <em>\u201cBlind Box\u201d</em>, which was created by an intergalactic government for \u201cdata and census information\u201d. Those who are able to complete the simulation will earn a cash prize. The simulation involves having one person\u2019s consciousness sucked into the simulation, while one guides that person through it from the real world. Two aliens, Neowise and Bobba, decide to enter the simulation to save their dying small \u201ccosmo diner\u201d. You play as Neo controlling Bobba in the simulation, trying to reach the end going through different challenges and obstacles. Will they complete it or do they have other plans in mind?</p>\n<p>01011001 01101111 01110101 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01100010 01100101 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01101001 01100101 01100100 00100000 01110100 01101111<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T05:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b511fefbb21676a025e3d0b279eb16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GameDev_Alan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
