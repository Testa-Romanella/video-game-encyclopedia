Just like a super sadistic game of snooker, really.</li><li>Heavily post-processed with neon lights, chromatic aberration\u00a0and bloom. Please take precautions if you are prone to\u00a0light sensitivity.</li></ul>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>I made this game over the course of 4 days\u00a0for the Brackeys Game Jam\u00a02021.1. The theme was \"Stronger Together.\" I wanted to make a game where the theme manifested itself in the enemy's behaviour and stats. Here, as the enemies stick together, their damage\u00a0 is scaled, as well as making them harder to push around.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a pure retro arcade-like top down shooter where I would just have fun making it. It's not the most in-depth gameplay, it could use new enemy types and player power ups, but I had fun basking in post-processing effects and neon glow glory. Hopefully you enjoy those too, let me know what you think in the comments.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>DevLog - </strong><em>Coming Soon</em></p>\n\n<p>------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Engine:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Unity 2020.1.16f1 with Universal Render Pipeline &amp; Cinemachine<br/></em><strong><br/>Coding Asset:</strong></p>\n<p>A* Pathfinding Project by Aron Granberg -\u00a0https://arongranberg.com/astar/</p><p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Quantum</em> by Sesohq -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/quantum-4.font</p>\n<p><em>Nasalization</em> by Typodermic Fonts -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/nasalization.font</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Royalty Free Music from Bensound -\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>Created using Leshy SFDesigner -\u00a0https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sfMaker/</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Created using Krita -\u00a0https://krita.org/en/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/176b44cccb6d0962c10a309bab2855d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Namida Sai"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
