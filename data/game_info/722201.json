I was the programmer.</p>\n<p>We took a lot of inspiration from the Doom reboots. We had originally intended for more arenas before the boss fight but we decided to cut them in order to let our level artists polish their work. The Mech is only usable in the tutorial and in Endless mode as a result.</p><p>You must deal damage to charge your Overdrive gauge. Once it is full, you can enter\u00a0Overdrive, boosting your stats and randomly swapping your weapon once it is over. Using Overdrive boosts your weapons' stats, making them a lot stronger as you progress.</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p><ul><li>Movements : ZQSD</li><li>Primary fire : Left click</li><li>Secondary fire\u00a0: Right click</li><li>Enter Overdrive/Mech rocket launcher\u00a0: A</li><li>Interact with Mech : F</li><li>Jump : Space</li><li>Dash : Shift</li><li>Grenade : G</li><li>Pause : Esc</li><li>Cheat menu : P</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c94efba517377b89e907df444b45fa91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baggs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
