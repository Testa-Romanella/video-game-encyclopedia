To fix the screen being cut off in the browser you may need to fullscreen it using the blue button in the bottom right.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a small, top-down, endless arcade game I made using Unity game engine. It is the first game I have made without directly following a tutorial. The music along with a few sound effects are from the course library from the free Unity course \"Create With Code.\" The rest of the sounds I made using a mix of SFXR and Audacity, however I am not very good at sound design or pixel art, but I did my best. (I decided to only make sprites for the powerups and leave the enemies as just capsules/circles) I took a little bit of inspiration for this project from the \"Journey of the Prairie King\" from Stardew Valley.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c8b3300051fa67815ad5fee044e3d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dragon11705"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
