You are tasked with remembering the items of several Heroes and your only help is a board you can fill with unrelated art assets. If you want to be successful you have to build yourself mnemonic bridges and update it as Heroes constantly change their equipment.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>- left click on a tile in the selection or on the memory board picks it up.</p>\n<p>- Another left click on the board puts it down.</p>\n<p>- right click with a tile in hand removes it.</p>\n<p>- right click on a tile on the board starts a link.</p>\n<p>- Another right click on a tile links those tiles together. You can link tiles to remember connections.</p>\n<p>- Use q and e to rotate a picked up tile.<br/></p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>all Sounds, all Music, the font and the background of the puzzle board are from Kenney Game Assets (www.kenney.nl)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b43/b43a361a966f76e893c1e9848b0ff431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zwarn", "Limashi"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
