I promised myself I would submit something to get a better grasp of the game dev pipeline, so that's what I'm doing\u00a0. My original idea was an inventory/weight management game where the weight the player is carrying\u00a0effects how much noise he creates. The player would have to balance taking fights with zombies with bringing the carried supplies to their destination. I plan to continue my game's development after this game jam.\u00a0Thanks to everyone to who tries it out, but please no high expectations. *</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:09:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gabealan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
