It's about a robot defending a reactor from aliens. You're able to build structures to defend the area and expand your network. All structures either cost or generate power, so you have to balance building turrets and generators. You expand your network by building lights because you can only build in the lit areas. Thank you for playing and any feedback is welcome!\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: I only have a Windows computer, so the Mac and Linux versions are not tested. Also press escape to leave the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01cb715cdb2221cafc1c151cec967b69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Aaron_M"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
