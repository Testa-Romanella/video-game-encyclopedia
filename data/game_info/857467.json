I made it together with\u00a0a friend, Marc,\u00a0who made the chill soundtrack, many of the assets as well as shaders\u00a0and helped me out with scripting. Please go check him and his projects out! :)\u00a0https://decipher-studio.itch.io/\u00a0//\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/marc.henf</p>\n<p>Credits also go out to my mom, who saw me drawing apple icons and really want to draw an apple as well, then didn't stop begging me to put it in my game because it was \"cute\"...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since it's my first uploaded game I'm very excited for any feedback! Don't be too harsh with it, it's just a game jam game and I promise I'd deliver something more polished if I\u00a0would've had more time :D\u00a0</p>\n<p>You guys having FUN???\u00a0Also, don't forget to not to be too stressed about it and take it relaxed, cuz this project is for the Cozy Autumn Game Jam! (EDIT: I didn't know I'd have to press \"Submit\" after I uploaded it... I missed the submission period by 10 seconds :( ). Anyway.\u00a0I would really like to maybe expand on the game (have some ideas for fun obstacles and decorations), optimize it, add more functionality etc. Let me know what you think ^-^</p>\n\n<p>Known issues/bugs:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Visual buttons don't seem to work</li><li>Inconsistencies with how many lives are being reducted</li><li>the game will have floating point problems, so you can't really get any further than 100 000m. Sorry! But good luck getting there in the first place :D</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:52:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0b/a0bc3b8ba535988ee33697b08e3643bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Decipher Studio", "HanseArt Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
