This game combines the quick and reactionary feel of a shooter with the exploration and decision making of classic roguelikes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsing an ASCII art aesthetic in its purest form, all visual assets are produced from a single text font file, software rendering and visual effects. The weapon and bullet system is fully interchangeable, over 150 gemstones to collect, several creatures and bosses, different game modes and a soundtrack that echoes through the open spaces in-between the rocky walls. Gemstone Keeper is the shooter that is both fun and eerie.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6fb3913adf857cce29e91c16cda76c6.jpg", "website": "http://gamepopper.co.uk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 16, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamepopper"], "esrb_rating": null}
