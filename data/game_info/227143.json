You can play others online, play against the computer, or pass and play. It is a 2 player board game, where each player controls a set of different pieces that are unknown to the opponent. The goal of the game is to find and capture the opponent's flag. Because each player cannot see the opponents pieces, discovery and exploration are an important part of the game.<br/><br/>This version of the game comes with 3 different board sizes: 10x10 (the standard size), 7x7, and 5x5. If you only have a few minutes and want to play a quick game, this allows you to pick a smaller board.<br/><br/>For online play, you can either randomly play another play, or invite a friend to play.
