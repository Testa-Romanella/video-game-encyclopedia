(Other gamepads might work; I haven&#39;t tried!) Also, this program only provides the visuals; if you want to amplify your voice, you&#39;ll have to handle that yourself.<br />\nSkully was once an Xbox Live Indie Games project, but now that XBLIG is offline, I&#39;ve made it available here on Itch!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T16:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9a0dec52d233208bae39e254ee69708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RavenWorks"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
