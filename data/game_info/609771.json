Medicines, painkillers, anti-inflammatories, supplements, and so on.\u00a0And some mornings this can be quite the challenge, with it feeling like they're getting stuck in your throat, or making you feel\u00a0nauseous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other days, they slide down easily and you take a moment to wonder, are you demonic enough to try dry swallowing them tomorrow? Or is that merely hubris waiting to strike you down?\u00a0<br/><br/>This is a super basic racing game, made using a Brackey's tutorial as a learning project, influenced by my daily experience taking a fistful of medications. The pill you'll be driving is, of course, PREP, because gay rights. I will not be taking further questions about that choice at this time.\u00a0<br/><br/>If you living in a nation with affordable healthcare, please talk to your health provider about whether or not PREP is right for you, no matter your sexuality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the A and D keys to guide the pill down your throat without triggering your gag reflex\u00a0(RIP non-QWERTY keyboards, I'm sorry).\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T09:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/285/2856619964d100d5130e3d0d2c3879ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Hanging Garden"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
