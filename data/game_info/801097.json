Items will come through on ships. So, you'll have to compete with other merchants to scoop those up. Partially by developing relationships with the pirates. And then you'll have to compete again during the day to sell your goods. Where your relationship with the townspeople will play a big role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Catch the fish before they catch you! There are some really strong fish off of these docks. They can easily pull you into the water if you aren't careful. Caught fish is an easy way that you can make some good money. Either by selling to another merchant or selling at your own stand for a premium.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As mentioned above, relationships will play a big role in your merchant life. Besides that, the docks will be a hustling and bustling place and will host a variety of loud and fun characters~!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T04:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2ed80ca3cea136271f2a97fbf153122b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keith Thomas"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Keith Thomas"], "esrb_rating": null}
