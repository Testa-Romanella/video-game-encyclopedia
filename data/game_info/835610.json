This is when we are coming in - HECU Collective are developing the Black Mesa: Blue Shift - a free remake with use of Black Mesa resources and style. We will try to stay as close to the original Blue Shift and Black Mesa as possible. Our mod will be releasing partially, chapter by chapter, so those who are not patient for the full release will finally have something to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-24T10:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/630/6302c31df7f1754cc2a8b6b23e275cb3.jpg", "website": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-blue-shift-remake", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 470, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
