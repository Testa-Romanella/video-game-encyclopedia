My first steps in this industry. I am hoping you will agree, it is interesting to watch how a child or Neil Armstrong makes first steps. No matter this step is taken by a child or an astronaut. It is great importance for someone who makes this step.</p>\n<p>You won't find a deep gameplay or a complex plot. This game uses Pong's (1972) mechanics. You need to save residents from a burning house and get points for it. You will get an extra life for every 100 points. The game randomly generates falling people. If you fail, you can start over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made on Unreal Engine 4. That's why it will consume more resources. Despite this I want to try this engine. Of course, this engine is suitable for big games. To my mind, if something allows you to create both large and small at the same time, the choice is behind the author.</p>\n<p>I will be glad to know your feedback. If you are unlucky, and you stumble upon a bug, I apologize. Describe it in the comments, please. I will try to fix it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>A-left\u00a0 \u00a0 D-Right</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:28:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e09/e09e827c500a56311ec65313a4059559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaksimRazor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
