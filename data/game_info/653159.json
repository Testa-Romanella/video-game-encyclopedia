It's been and honor to take part in this challenge and and honor to be amongst so many awesome people.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to keep building on this and add more events such as long jump and high jump events and also an endurance event. The timeframe was too short for me as noob but i had so much fun and learnt so much. The first game i have ever made from start to finish using my own methods. (Definitely not the best, but opened my eyes to what is possible)</p>\n<p>What started as a simple race ended up being extremely complicated for me and at times i wanted to just delete the ai hahaha. But the lucky little bastard hung in there and in the end even showed me that he could be even tougher (Easy to hard)</p>\n<p>I play-tested it so many times trying to get the times and sounds right that i reget that I\u00a0wasn't able to add a save record time so others could see but please screenshot your best times and share them. My personal best was 5:60 :P</p>\n<p>I do plan on adding multiplayer later on but I'm still a noob so don't expect it too soon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Assets Used</p>\n\n<p> ActorCore Motions</p>\n<p>*fist_flyingkick_m_fist_flyingkick_m</p>\n<p>\u00a0*fist_grumpyclaw_f_fist_grumpyclaw_f</p>\n<p> *fist_kungfu_m_fist_kungfu_m</p>\n<p> *fist_whirlwindkick_m_fist_whirlwindkick_m</p>\n<p> *sword_judgment_m_sword_judgment_m</p>\n<p> *aerobic-dance_315220</p>\n<p> Advanced Locomotion System Anim Sequences</p>\n<p> *ALS_C_Idle</p>\n<p> *ALS_Idle_Additive</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Idle</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Idle_AdditivePose</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Run_F</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Sprint_F</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Sprint_F_Impulse</p>\n<p> *ALS_N_Walk_F</p>\n<p> Metahuman</p>\n<p>Using the base skeleton and casual shoe asset and materials and textures.</p>\n<p> BoomLibrary EpicJam Free Pack</p>\n<p> *SIDS_RI_AR_10__308_Suppressed_Ricochet.wav</p>\n<p> *Impact_Synth_Low_Boom.wav</p>\n<p> *MUI_IMPACT_SWEETENER_Robotic_Kick</p>\n<p> *Impact_Voice_Choir_Male_Whisper</p>\n<p> BoomLibrary Free Sounds Cinematic Pack</p>\n<p> *</p>\n<p> WeLoveIndies From bundle downloaded with epicjam voucher (WLEpMgJm21)</p>\n<p> *kf013105-attack-run</p>\n<p> *kf013616-urban-culture</p>\n<p> *kf013623-just-the-idea</p>\n<p> *kf013629-movie-logo-03</p>\n<p> *kf014718-goal-oriented</p>\n<p> *kf018214-elegantly</p>\n<p> *kf018223-color-boost</p>\n<p> *kf025609-final-lockdown</p>\n<p> KitBash3d from epicjam kitbash bundle</p>\n<p> *KB3D_MGJ_BldgLG_E_SolarPanelsA</p>\n<p> *KB3D_MGJ_BldgLG_E_SolarPanelsC</p>\n<p> *KB3D_MGJ_BldgLG_G_Base</p>\n<p> *KB3D_MGJ_BldgMD_B_Road</p>\n<p> Googe Free fonts</p>\n<p> *Orbitron</p>\n<p> Unreal Engine Content</p>\n<p> *SkySphere mesh and materials</p>\n<p> Unreal Engine Content Examples</p>\n<p> *Beam Particle and materials (Modified)</p>\n<p> *Ribbon Particle and materials(Modified)</p>\n\n\n<p>If you have any feedback please don't be shy.
