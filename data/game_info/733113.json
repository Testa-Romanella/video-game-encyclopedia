Sliding Blaster is a top-down shooter where you can shoot in all directions, but the twist is that you're continually\u00a0<em>sliding</em> through the level. You cannot stop moving, you can only boost toward a different direction, which will cause you to start moving in that direction instead. There's limited ammo and you have to continually collect it.</p>\n<ul><li>This game is open source</li><li> Two players support - second player can join in any time</li><li>Simple level editor in the game</li><li>Supports the SNES mouse, if you plug one in with an adapter</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T05:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/255/255c30e74462f3b74aadf6ef3981e921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NovaSquirrel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
