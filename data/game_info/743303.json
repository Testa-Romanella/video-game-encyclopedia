Face off against 38 computer opponents with a deck built from 340 cards you can collect, or build two of your own decks and watch the computer play them, or play against another human! You'll travel across a colorful world and meet some wacky individuals as you collect cards and defeat the Kings and Queens of the four houses.</p>\n<p>Use the left mouse button to select things, and the right mouse button to cancel.
