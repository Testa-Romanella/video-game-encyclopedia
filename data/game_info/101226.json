The traditional tile based movement has been removed but, the ability to stop the game when you stop inputting controls remains. I am attempting to introduce streamlined gameplay while also increasing the depth of combat and interaction. It's hard to explain the game feel without playing it, so just give it a shot, and remember dying is fun! :)</p><p>move = wads/mouse-middle/l-stick</p><p>sprint = shift/l-bumper</p><p>point weapon = arrows/mouse/r-stick</p><p>shield = space/rightclick/r-bumper</p><p>inventory = tab/back/select</p><p>version 0.37</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41f45c97166d1c7361124327d926ca02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["polkm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
