Small disclaimer: there might be some missing rails sections. And occasional barbarian attacks. But don\u2019t worry, our trains are the most reliable out there. Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you! <br/>Did we mention wildfires?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Trackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way.<br/><br/>The game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There aren't many resources in the desert, so you\u2019ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You\u2019ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, it\u2019s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>With enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Attacks are frequent. You\u2019ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, you\u2019ll have to be more creative with how you use them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Feed your train with coal, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Bring your friends along for a ride! Join forces to tackle challenges on a journey to the final destination with Trackline Express multiplayer mode. Unite your strengths, strategically plan your next steps and defeat incoming threats!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You just want to play during a short break? We got you covered!
