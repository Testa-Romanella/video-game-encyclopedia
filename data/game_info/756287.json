This is very much a prototype and probably not very balanced.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a genre mashup between Tower Defense and Card Game. Read below for the full instructions. In game instructions aren't as descriptive right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left Click: Drag cards and press buttons\r\n</li><li>Right Click: Rotate card and drag the camera view\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Deploy girls and transform them into magical girls to stop the rats and capybaras. Each wave you are given a card (80% common, 20% uncommon) with a max hand size of 4. If your hand is full, the card will go into the deck. If the deck is full, the card will be destroyed. Hand will be drawn to full each wave.<br/></p>\n<p>Drag girl cards onto the field to use them and addon cards onto them to equip them.</p>\n<p>Girls can equip two cards by default but by using a Magical Core card, you can transform them into Magical girls to increase their card capacity.</p>\n<p>Duplicate cards can not be equipped. A girl can only equip one Magical Core card.</p>\n<p>Discarded cards add points to use at the shop (1 for common, 2 for uncommon). Use the shop if RNG isn't helping.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately there is no end or bosses, the game will loop while upgrading enemy tiers. Approximately 50 waves is the \"goal\" at this time. The game will result in having all end tier enemies around wave 100.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Music and some sound effects were done by my brother.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T11:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd4/cd44bef32239ef262d6bf6883f8b2ed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AJuneBug"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
