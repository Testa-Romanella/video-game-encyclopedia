Regrowth\u2605\u00a0</strong>is a real time strategy game\u00a0where you grow your army, literally. Whenever a floewer dies, they will drop seeds that can be watered and grown into more units. Collect resources and\u00a0construct buildings to fend off the enemies.\u00a0Made during the Tri-Campus Jam hosted by\u00a0University of Washington Bothell, Seattle, and Tacoma's game development clubs, in Summer 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Click/Drag: Select Units\r\n</li><li>Right Mouse Click: Action\r\n</li><li>B Key: Toggle Building Menu</li></ul><p>Tips that I couldn't fit in the tutorial during the jam:</p><p>In the early game, storages are good alternatives for walls which unlock a bit later.</p><p>The difficulty of incoming enemy waves scales with your population. While it might seem like it could be helpful to intentionally send floewers to death, this increases the population and can make the game much more difficult than it should be.</p><p>You can see how many of each color of fleowers you have by hovering over the population counter on the top. Useful to find out whether you want more white fleowers.</p><p>Keep note of the direction the enemy will be approaching from and build defense ahead of time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T08:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/313760f9b543537373cf1358f2f48c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chao"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
