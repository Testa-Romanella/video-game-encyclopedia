But where are you?</p><p>His pronouncement startles you awake, and you realize it's already time for the Come In, which means the big show will be starting soon. In a stupor, you see that you're next to three monkeys, all sitting in a row, staring at you. Metal bars prevent your escape on all sides. A locked door is on the southern wall of the cage. It's clear by your environment and the awful smell that you're in the Monkey Tent.</p><p>Your head aches, and when you touch it, you can feel a sizable lump. How did you end up here? Was it something to do with the Aerialist, your love? Or the Bearded Woman? In any case, the Lion Tamer was involved. Of this, you are positive.</p><p><strong><em>One Day Only</em></strong></p><p>An Interactive Fiction by John Vanderhoef</p><p>More from this developer: https://johnvanderhoef.itch.io<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/cae151a11834c792b13a26a02c3810ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["John Vanderhoef"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
