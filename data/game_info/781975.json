I have divided the whole\u00a0system in to four parts and implemented them into as a each individual part. Those are:<br/>1. Movement.<br/>2. Resource consumption.<br/>3.\u00a0Reproduction.<br/>4. Evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Code Design:</strong> \u00a0I\u00a0have divided code in to components which are implemented by OOPS and Game Programming Patterns. For instance:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Movement --&gt; MoveTowards, Core is a target position.</li><li>Reproduction --&gt; Coroutine, Inheritance for different objects.</li><li>Radius --&gt; Line Renderer --&gt; MathF.Sin and Cos (Degrees to radians)</li><li>Collision --&gt; Physics.OverLap --&gt; Follow Target\u00a0</li><li>Destroy --&gt; List ,\u00a0Collider hit which reset the object position to start location</li><li>Evolution --&gt;\u00a0 State Design Pattern, to define states which are\u00a0 move, evolve, old\u00a0 and reproduce.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Link:</strong>\u00a0\" Github code Click here \" code</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T22:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cda79bc9e12a68b812e31c7e65945ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Sravan Kairamkonda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
