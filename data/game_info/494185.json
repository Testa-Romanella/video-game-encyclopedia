It's slow and not terribly efficient, but it's a fun way to look at how even a dumb computer can be programmed to solve a fairly complex maze. <br/></p>\n<p>Since it's coded in BASIC, the source can be easily viewed by BREAKing into the program.<br/></p>\n<p>You will need an emulator to play this game. May I suggest my own emulator Zero to play this game:\u00a0http://zero.arjunnair.in/download/</p>\n<p>Or you can try various others, for various platforms, that can be found at:\u00a0https://worldofspectrum.org/tools/emulators</p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:48:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/730/73061309d12f4f985eb6728355d3a7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KnightOrc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
