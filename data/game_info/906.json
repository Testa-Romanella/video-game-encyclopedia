{"id": 906, "slug": "cod-black-ops-iii", "name": "Call of Duty: Black Ops III", "name_original": "Call of Duty: Black Ops III", "description": "<p>Call of Duty Black Ops III is a science fiction first-person shooter, the twelfth game in the whole Call of Duty franchise and the third chapter in the Black Ops series. The action begins in 2065, 40 years after the events of the second part, so the game has several historical references. However, the game is not a direct sequel to the previous Black Ops game. Players are offered to assume the role of a CIA special unit trooper trying to get along with the new artificial intelligence DNI (Direct Neural Interface) system and to solve mysteries hidden in it. The whole gameplay is divided into three usual for Black Ops series game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. The single-player campaign can be also completed in a squad (up to four members). Players are able to choose proper equipment and even customize the character before starting another mission. After the completion, each level could be replayed in a \u201crealistic\u201d difficulty or in a \u201cNightmares\u201d mode (regular enemies are replaced with zombies).</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2015-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T12:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fd6/fd6a1eecd3ec0f875f1924f3656b7dd9.jpg", "website": "https://www.callofduty.com/blackops3", "rating": 3.26, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 214, "owned": 4974, "beaten": 927, "toplay": 156, "dropped": 585, "playing": 61}, "playtime": 16, "achievements_count": 1168, "ratings_count": 1434, "suggestions_count": 560, "game_series_count": 29, "reviews_count": 1444, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Raven Software", "Treyarch", "Beenox", "Nerve Software", "XPEC", "XPEC Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Aspyr", "Activison"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
