I don't think it needs a warning and I also think it's safe to say that\u00a0 children can play but it's not recommended.</p>\n\r\nMinor Update\r\n<p>I got some feedback saying that players couldn't see the monster.\u00a0Well, the flashlight breaks when shining it on the monster but I forgot to mention that in the game. Sorry!</p>\n<p>I updated the game to make sure that it gets mentioned and I made a few tweaks to the flashlight so the monster won't instantly run away upon contact with it.</p>\n<p>Hope it helps!</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> to Move</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong> to\u00a0Look Around</li><li><strong>Left-Click</strong> to Interact</li><li><strong>E</strong> to Toggle Flashlight</li><li><strong>Q</strong> to Crawl Out</li><li><strong>F</strong> to Fix Flashlight</li><li><strong>Hold ESC</strong> to Quit</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T15:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/8791c4627b84a9be421806717bc52476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZumTheZazaKing"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
