As day turns into endless day, The light remains, unyielding and gray.\r\n</p>\n<p>But as the night approaches near, We pray for darkness, for it to appear. Yet when it comes, our fears arise, For the darkness lingers, and never dies.\r\n</p>\n<p>A world consumed by endless night Forever lost in this abyss, We scream and cry, but no one hears our pleas.\r\n</p>\n<p>The light was once our biggest fear, But now the darkness is forever near. A world without balance, without hope, We are trapped in this eternal, endless scope.\r\n</p>\n<p>Endless light, until the night, Forever dark, an eternal fright.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T12:21:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb28942962dc140779401751e044952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fussy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
