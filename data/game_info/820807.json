The all powerful die itself can shred through enemies and you are simply there to guide it.<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<strong><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>*The game is not at all in a complete state. There are no game states, no score, no level design\u00a0no real gameplay, no game, it's all an illusion, we live in the matrix, wake up.*<br/></em></strong>(it was a little rushed and i need sleep)<br/><br/>The die can be rolled by the player coming into contact with it (changes weapons). Shooting the die will move it around but will not roll.\u00a0<br/><br/>The initial project plan was to have different weapons with different attributes for numbers 1-6 on the die being:<br/>1 - No weapon. Smack the die around till it hits enemies<br/>2 - Shotgun. Knockback enemies till the die smacks into them<br/>3 - Tracer rounds. The die chases your bullets<br/>4 - Bouncing bullets. Ricochet those things off walls<br/>5 - Explosive die. Will detonate on touch<br/>6 - Minigun. Who needs a die when you have a minigun. Smack around enemies yourself</p>\n<p>A game made for GMTK 2022. I started this jam with 7 hours left and thought it would be a great idea to learn a new engine (Godot) in that time. Was definitely a good learning experience. Its now 2am.
