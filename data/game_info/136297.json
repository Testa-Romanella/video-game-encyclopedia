This coming of age story explores identity crisis, the search for love, and transformation.</p><p>My Mind subverts the rules of Othello, a game from the late 1800's. Instead of trying to beat the opponent, My Mind forces the player to ask, who is the opponent? Who am I? Each story item has a human side (PINK) and an alien side (TEAL). With each story item the player places on the board, she chooses between her human and alien. The end state of the board represents her identity. </p><p>16+</p><p>Game Designers<br/>Yiwen Dai: Lead Programmer, 2D Art<br/>Atley Loughridge: Writer, Sound Design, Programmer<br/>Katie Pustolski: 3D Art, Programmer<br/>Boer Song: Sound Design</p><p>Music by<br/>Disasterpeace</p><p>Special Thanks to<br/>Tracy Fullerton<br/>Andreas Kratky<br/>Disasterpeace<br/>USC Interactive Media and Games class of 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90c/90c1bdbcd10948d75ac341910f9e6c7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
