The game revolves around territory control mechanics with large battles with up to 2000 players participating. Combat takes place on the continents of a fictional planet which are broken up into many territories. Control over these sectors grants bonuses to the faction in control. Teamwork and coordinated attacks are a necessity on the way to victory.</p>\n<p>There are three factions present in the game: the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate, and Vanu Sovereignty. Each faction has its own unique visual style and playstyle. For example, the Republic relies on conventional ballistic weaponry while railguns and gauss rifles are widespread in the Conglomerate.</p>\n<p>Planetside 2 features a freemium business model similar to League of Legends. While the game can be played for free, there is an in-game shop where players can buy new weapons, vehicles, and cosmetics for either real money or in-game currency.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2012-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2fd/2fd1b58116b10cc1f4442bee5593ca7c.jpg", "website": "http://www.planetside2.com/", "rating": 2.98, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 118, "owned": 4141, "beaten": 101, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 427, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 512, "suggestions_count": 606, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 513, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Daybreak Games Company"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Daybreak Game Company"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
