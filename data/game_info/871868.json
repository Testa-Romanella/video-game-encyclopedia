Starting off with the killing of Mr. Hyde in Paris, one must use the character of Van Helsing to hunt down Dracula in Transylvania. The character of Carl is completely missing from the video game but to reasonable accuracy, the characters of Anna Valerious, Velkan Valerious, Igor, Dracula and his three brides are portrayed as in the movie.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T08:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/136/1362f48a2cb15c627d3e04b8a9241087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Saffire"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["VU Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
