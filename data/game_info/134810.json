{"id": 134810, "slug": "scifi-butterfly", "name": "SciFi Butterfly", "name_original": "SciFi Butterfly", "description": "<p>This is a survival-inspired game. An increasing variety of enemies are spawned as the game progresses. The player is unlikely to survive without making use of the power-up system.</p><p>The ultimate aim of the game is to kill a certain number of enemies and progress to the next level (for now there is only one level and the game ends when the level objectives are met).</p><p>Coins and random-drop power-ups are earned during the game. The coins can be used to purchase an additional variety of powerups. </p><p>This is a single-level prototype which I am releasing in order to gauge interest. Ultimately I plan to release a multi-level game using the same basic mechanics, but with a bigger variety of enemies and a more interesting level design.<br/></p><p>Please let me know if you encounter any bugs or if you have any ideas to improve the game.</p><p>Know Issues: The stairs sometimes cause the enemies to behave oddly. The vertical range of the player is intentionally limited, thus preventing the player from looking fully down stairs. As a result, future levels will not have stairs!</p>Regards<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89e/89e3f356b3c13690671a55c62bee9b2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PolyGoon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
