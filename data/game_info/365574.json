You didn't get far before you got sacrificed by a friend who threw you at a button to open a gate, lets hope they didn't sacrifice you in vain.\r\nThis is a <strong>Four Player</strong>\u00a0experience, to be played with Xbox controllers connected to a computer. We realize this is a really small niche but then again- is that not where these experimental Jam games shine the most?\r\n\r\n[p.s. If you still want to try the game, even tho it's a multiplayer game we left the debug-command to swap between characters on keys 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4.\u00a0\u00a0However - we don't recommend this as there's a lot of bugs related to this debug-feature.]", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ec/8ecc1ed6bc6780da498afccb5f387ad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Connecta"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
