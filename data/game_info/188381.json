Some days later, a \"giant red beast\" had been seen in the wood and many little animals are found dead. While every one is worried about the reason God sends them these terrifying signs, one cares more about another thing, one special thing: the evil spirit and his desirs. Become a mayor of a little village, near the quiet river and the peaceful mountain; and serve your overload until you're sufficiently trusted by all to accomplish the Final Ritual to summon the beast, the beautiful and overpowered Mordak !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68aa8e6d89cc7042c41de3608ed4dd9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shad0war"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
