This weeks theme being find and click.</p>\n<p>In this small game you reveal a drawing and although it is quite limited i enjoyed it's interesting aesthetic. The game's assests are made from scanned physical drawings instead of digital ones. This technique proved to be quite difficult however i think the game proves it's concept and with further refinement could become quite successful.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bc/4bc673aeb64c8e3f4b876576313d5df0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Li_Macc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
