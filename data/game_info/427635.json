Besides, you\u2019ll be able to craft your own combos in the combo editor and evolve each character\u2019s skill tree, to make the experience truly unique and personal. During the game, you\u2019ll face different enemies with different behaviors, weapons and weaknesses, so your gear and combo configuration will decide if you\u2019re victorious! <br/><br/><br/>In Holmgang, you\u2019ll explore the world of Dracorum by land and sea, finding friends and foes along the way.

An artistic mix that tries to reproduce hand-made paintings. While created in 3D, Holmgang uses several techniques that sets it apart from other games. <br/>The music is another strong pillar, and has an orchestral epic style. There\u2019s a theme for each character, defining the emotions of the heroes and changing with the action of the game.
