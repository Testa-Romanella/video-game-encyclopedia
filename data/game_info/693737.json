Do you have what it takes to save your friend...or your life?</p>\n<p>The reason I named it \"Vulcanist\" was because the player has a special flame attack that can only be used so many times.</p>\n<p>Grab a pair of gaming headphones, get your keyboard ready, and get your gaming skills up and running. Get ready to play my best game.</p>\n<p>Be sure to play with your friends in Multiplayer mode.</p>\r\nHow I built it\r\n<p>The only dependencies I used were P5.js in WebGL mode and SocketIO. I hand-drew almost all the assets in pixel art and only got some sound effects and screen damage effects from online sites like [itch.io](https://itch.io), [zapsplat.com](https://zapsplat.com), and [soundbible.com](https://soundbible.com).</p>\n<p>I wrote down a checklist of what I would do during the seven days of the jam, sketched all the things I would need to draw, and planned really hard before the competition. That's why I was able to do this.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Game controls are in the game, but I'll post the instructions here anyways.</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Move<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys / Mouse</strong> - Turn/Look<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click</strong> - Attack<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Right Click / R</strong> - Reload<br/></p>\n<p><strong>F</strong> - Flame Attack<br/></p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Change Weapon<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Spacebar</strong> - Jump<br/></p>\n<p><strong>M</strong> - Toggle Music<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT + (W/A/S/D)</strong> - Sprint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a44168f5d1ba2d5fba0994b74cd4048c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeviathanProgramming"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
