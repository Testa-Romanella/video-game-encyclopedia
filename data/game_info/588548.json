I use servers for traversal of the network packages. Connecting 2 routers peer to peer is not an easy task.<br/>Everytime you want to send a network packet to the enemy, you will send it to the server and the server will send it to the enemy.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Steam gives access to free servers and code when you release your game there to handle peer 2 peer networking, which is why I currently don't want to make my custom solution.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>This server relay system adds a lot of delay (someone who's 2 streets away from me against whom I play with 20ms in other games has 150ping in this game)<br/>Hopefully this will be fixed if and when I realese this tech demo on steam. (I will do this once I have couple characters &amp; levels in the game.)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Also important about multiplayer!!<br/>During testing I've had one desync which happened at 450ping with 10% packet drops (This was surprisingly playable). I don't know if there is a desync issue or if this was because of this ridiculous condition</li></ul>\n<p>Important about inputs!!!\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Currently the menu's only work with mouse.\r\n</li><li>I am using the built in gamepad in ue4 that uses directinput which only supports xbox &amp; logitech controllers. You can emulate an xbox gamepad for ds4 controller using a tool called ds4windows (http://ds4windows.com/)<br/>I will enable rawinput once i've got keybinding figured out (this will enable all controllers that work with windows to work in game)</li></ul>\n<p>Game is only tested on latest update of windows 10 as of 17/04/2021 with\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>nvidia rtx 2070 + ryzen 5\r\n</li><li>and\u00a0 \u00a0 gtx 1080 + intel i5\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game will probably be a bug fest. It's not properly tested. But like I wrote earlier, it's a tech demo.\r\n</p>\n<p>todo's next update (I will try to release these in 2-4 weeks)\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fix training mode ( popup with frame data of last hit move. visible hit/hurtboxes, combo counter, damage done in combo, record input for dummy, set dummy in block mode, etc.)\r\n</li><li>Fix gamepad/keyboard selection for local play (currently first person to press a button when te level loads gets assigned the left side the second gets assigned right side after this the counter resets so gamepad 3 will get assigned left side)\r\n</li><li>Add background/ambient noise/sound to the level.\r\n</li><li>Add more moves\r\n</li><li>Add one more character\r\n</li><li>Add character select\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Some more todo's\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Add loading screen\r\n</li><li>Add controller support to ui's\r\n</li><li>Match record and replay\r\n</li><li>Add assist/tagging (There are videos of the unity versions that show how this will work.)\r\n</li><li>Dodging (If you look at video of the previous version of the game, you will see that there are moments when a fighter dodges moves. The logic here is that you can burn meter to dodge which will give you 75%/125% on block frame advantage depending on + or -\r\n</li><li>Add crouch, for low/high blocking\r\n</li><li>The frame data on moves are placeholder. I just randomly set this up. I will set the frame data on the moves to make more sense in the future\r\n</li><li>Add soundfx for dashing\r\n</li><li>Some memory optimization with game state (I've been playing it loose with my memory management bcuz I have enough ram on my pc, but I will fix this soon. ex. of this is that In many places where I could just use an 8 byte memory I use 16/32 byte which counts up since you have te save your gamestate every frame for rollback.)\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Add frame delay based on ping or give player a choice (currently hard coded 3 frame delay for multiplayer)\r\n</li><li>Fix bug with camera showing from wrong side (up and down button reverse when this happens)\r\n</li><li>Add button remapping. (There are cheap code you can buy In unreal marketplace which I might use if this becomes an issue, but this is something I want to learn how to code)\r\n</li><li>Play arround with the circle. (the stage is a circle, if you go outside of the circle you'ill lose health over time)\r\n<ul><li>smaller with time?\r\n</li></ul><ul><li>change position every x time?\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Release on steam (this will fix the packet traversal issue, I want to atleast have created 2 more characters before I do this)\r\n</li><li>Release on xbox using uwp? (uwp is something indie devs can use to make games for xbox without owning a developer tools. It's free for anyone but comes with huge drop in performance.)\r\n<ul><li>I might do this to test crossplay. I have coded the game with crossplay in mind.\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Add an option to put the camera behind the fighter for single player gameplay (like an arena fighting game)\r\n</li><li>Fix for unlocked fps: inbetween frame interpolation has and issue that the wrong animation is shown for a split second (this works most of the time, but goes crazy sometimes)\r\n</li><li>Fix movement lerping for unlocked fps (this is programmed correctly but parameters need to be tweaked for differen frame rate + different pings)\r\n</li><li>Add on hit particle fx.\r\n</li><li>Add slight camera shake on hit.\r\n</li><li>Add modding support (changing 3d models, levels, sound fx, particle fx ).\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Inputs:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard\r\n<ul><li>Z/W=&gt; Kick\r\n</li><li>Q/A=&gt; Punch\r\n</li><li>S=&gt; Guard\r\n</li><li>D=&gt; Special\r\n</li><li>CTRL =&gt; Throw\r\n</li><li>Arrow keys=&gt; Movement\r\n</li><li>Shift =&gt;\u00a0 Dash button</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Controller:\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>NOTE about dlss!!</p>\n<ul><li>I added every option there is in dlss. But unreal engine doesn't support every mode for every gpu.</li><li>for example: rtx2070 doesn't support ultra quality dlss on 1440p in unreal engine. I will code a detection in the future to fill in the options with only the supported settings by the gpu instead of putting all the options in the settings menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T06:48:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/65746ce724b11fdcaa9cfa07962872bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROBpOcket"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
