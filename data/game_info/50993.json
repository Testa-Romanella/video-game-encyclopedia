Otherwise, you can\u2019t play it!</strong><br/><br/>Orcs started a war against goblins because they are so small and weak. Goblins aren\u2019t the strongest so they have to be smart and that\u2019s what goblins are for sure! You and your friends are the best goblin crafters in the world so you started a weapon shop together to craft an end to this war! Smelt, mold, and forge your own weapons and send them out on the battlefield so your goblin warriors can fight! <br/><br/>Do you think you can win this war?! Gather your friends, 2-4 controllers and dive into the (small) shoes of the goblin crafters!<br/><br/><strong>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS (WITH WEAPONS)</strong><br/>The orcs change their weapons a lot. They have spears, swords and axes. To beat an orc, you need to craft a weapon that counters the weapon of the orcs! So pay attention to what the orcs are fighting with! SWORD, AXE, SPEAR... GO!<br/><br/><strong>CRAFTING</strong><br/>There is lots of work to do in the goblin gear shop so divide the tasks properly! There are more than 8 crafting machines and they all work in their own unique way. Learn the process and get even better than you already were!<br/><br/><strong>SKILLCHECKS</strong><br/>All crafting machines have their own unique skill check that you have to perform. Are you doing it perfectly? Then you will make the best weapon ever! Are you doing it terribly wrong and you\u2019re sending your trashy weapon to the battlefield? Then you\u2019re giving the orcs a big advantage (so don\u2019t do that, okay?). Make sure that not only you but also your goblin friends are performing the skill checks well. You are all responsible for the final product and it needs to be good. NO EXCUSES!<br/><br/>\u2028Now quick, get on the battlefield and make all goblins proud!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T18:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/409/4097cb0a379b6bdda6d26c815a767a29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 167}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Minus2"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Minus2"], "esrb_rating": null}
