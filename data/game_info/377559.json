You are Andor, the guardian dragon of the kingdom and have stood guard for the royal family for centuries. But when you look down at yourself, something is wrong. No longer is your body strong, no longer are your wings wide and no longer do scorching flames erupt from your throat when you roar.<br/><br/>You are weak and small, but a shell of the mighty dragon you once were. All because of one sorcerer -- Javros -- who wants to overthrow the royal family and seize control for themselves.<br/><br/>Regain your lost power by collecting crystal fragments and return to your original form in order to take on the sorcerer and restore peace to the kingdom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:05:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6e/b6ea65354972ab3b53f45d5e669cb1c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ignitusgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
