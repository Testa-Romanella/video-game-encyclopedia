It takes place in a world reminiscent of a Sunday morning cartoon which is inhabited by people with an odd \"bean\" shaped. Looking past the strange humanoid creatures, the setting is still an organic urban world which is very full of active life. The game focuses on three teenager beans, our protagonists, who have become aware of their mayor's plans to banish summer break in their town. The teens friendship, or sometimes lack of, will be their driving force to take on a quest through various places, virtual reality, and even alternate dimensions! Upgrade weapons, learn new abilities, and recruit allies as you become powerful enough to defeat The Mayor (Voiced by Space Ghost himself, George Lowe)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57cbc9f66a9ff107648e07d4426163c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Take This Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
