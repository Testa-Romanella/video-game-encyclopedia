The game will feature a variety of mini-games\u00a0as well as a collection room to house all your prizes. And more content is being thought up all the time.\u00a0As of 0.34, the crane is functional and there is a basic version of the main \"collection\" game as well as two mini-game ideas. Any feedback on the control and feel so far is encouraged and will be taken into consideration. The goal here is to create a game that while frustrating and not entirely reliable, can be heaps of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Note: If you stumbled upon this from elsewhere, feel free to follow @MousemeatGames on Twitter for consistent updates on this and other projects.
