The dog doesn't like to eat chocolate or veggies. Eating a chocolate and Jalapeno peppers will lead to automatic game over. But other veggies will take away time. The more that Mochiko eats, the more heavy she will be \u2013 which means you will need to tap more to jump higher. There is a special food that will increase her weight, but not make her more heavy, it is sushi :)\r\n</p>\n<p>I recently added a global leaderboard, so you can put your initials if you make it in the top 5.</p>\n<p>The game is available on AppStore and Google Play store.</p>\n<p>Here's a screenshot of the game: https://imgur.com/a/ZpDumFh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b382b79e029bce946265d076f203a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mochiko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
