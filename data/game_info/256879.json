The player must be tested but not defeated, guided but not escorted, and empowered but not omnipotent. In Balance, you aid a struggling game developer and are\u00a0tasked to make the game fun but challenging. Playtesters are eager to succeed, but will become bored with the quest if you fail to entertain them. Challenge them with enemies and lead them to exciting new worlds. But make sure that they are victorious in their journey, or else you may never hear from them again.</p>\n<p>All non-audio assets (c) Jonathan Matthews 2018</p>\n<p>Audio assets courtesy of ZapSplat,\u00a0Lobo Loco, and\u00a0Sara Afonso.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db9/db9dec4a0d32e1d18a39681f76a84afe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kaleido"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
