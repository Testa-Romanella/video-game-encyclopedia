{"id": 213089, "slug": "step-out", "name": "Step Out", "name_original": "Step Out", "description": "<p><em>Step Out</em> plays just like your usual rhythm game. Except that the rhythm is a mess, and every time you press a button you break something.</p>\n<p>This game was created in 48 hours for the 2018 editions of both the Music Game Jam and the GMTK Jam, which theme was <em>\u201cGenre without mechanic\u201d</em>.</p>\n<p>Also, while this is technically not a rhythm game, it's still a musical one! So make sure your audio is enabled.<br/></p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>Part of the game's challenge is figuring out its rules! So I suggest you to play it a while before reading this section.</p>\n<p>If you're stuck, here are the basics:</p>\n<p>Notes fall from above in an inactive state. There are 3 colors of notes. Each time you hit a color, you activate the note, and you start a <em>combo. </em>The combo value will increase each time you hit a note of that color. Also, the more active notes there are in the color, the more score you will make when hitting a note (combo will be multiplied by the number of active notes). Thus if you want to get a big score, you must try to activate several notes of the same color. The combo breaks if you miss one active note of the color (inactive ones have no effect when missed), or if you push a key without hitting any note.</p>\n<p>At the start of the game, you have to fill each color's bar. The bars work just like combo: the more active notes there are in the color, the faster it will get filled. However, it decreases each time you break a combo (missing an active note or hitting a wrong key).</p>\n<p>Once you finished the game, you can still try to reach an high score. When you start a combo, you can see its value on the left of the corresponding bar. And on the right is the best score you've obtained with one combo.</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<ul><li><strong>Bungee</strong>\u00a0font\u00a0by David Jonathan Ross</li><li>LdcBlackRound font by <em>lagdotcom</em></li><li><strong>Vibraphone\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Rhodes</strong><em> </em>soundfont from bandshed.net</li><li><strong>Spanish Classical Guitar</strong> soundfont from FreePats</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db59c3ce845feb15607e9cc1b46dd48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itooh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
