The idea is that the first 6 rounds (Level I) the robot will attack you based on a pre-programmed rules (no AI). \u00a0If you succeed on beating the robot, this one will apply the previous experience in battle to learn an adapted behavior. After that in the  next 6 rounds (Level I - red), you will fight the robot with real AI. This cycle will be repeated again in Leve II, with a preprogrammed behavior (with a quicker robot) and then again in Level II-red, the robot will adapt in order to beat you. Take into account that there is a remaining time counter (on the top-left screen) that if reaches 0, automatically this means a Game Over, although there is plenty of time in trying to beat the robot.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W</strong> (move up) \u00a0- <strong>\u00a0A</strong> (move left) -\u00a0 <strong>S</strong> (move down) \u00a0 - <strong>\u00a0D</strong> (move right)</p>\n<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>Arrow up</strong> (shoot) <br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Left Arrow</strong> (rotate Counter-Clockwise) <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Right Arrow</strong> (rotate Clockwise)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Design &amp; Programming + Sprite Designs:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0https://bl4ckrose.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Background Space Image:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 https://norma-2d.itch.io/</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Download the compressed file, extract the files and then\u00a0run\u00a0 \"ai_blaster.exe\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:58:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c4/4c45efc8f37dbcef9929460d662b5446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bl4ckRose"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
