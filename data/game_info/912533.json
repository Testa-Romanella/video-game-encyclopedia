Raven technology company is now number 1 in the world in robot production. They manufacture and sell different service robots all over the world. The R-100 class were the first class of home service robots. These robots, which had a human-like appearance and structure, were only robots that acted according to the commands of their owners and had no other function than housework. Then a class of robots was developed specifically for the military. R-200 class. This class was much faster, durable and stronger than many other robot classes. However, their intelligence and ability to react to events were not yet at the level the company wanted. They also began to develop the R-300 class. They worked to make it both stronger and smarter than the R-200 class. They designed a cube body and a robot structure that can move much faster. They developed a modular class of robots where different tools and weapons can be attached to 3 different surfaces. These robots were both much more intelligent and much stronger due to their modular structure. The character we control is a robot with the R-300 class and its name is Bartle. One day, as a result of a systemic error, many of the robots riot and try to create chaos and start a rebellion against the company. We are a security robot that stops this uprising. But there is an issue. Because of the systemic error, the tools attached to the 3 surfaces are not under Bartle's control. It cannot control these skills in any way. They are all became self-activated. So, Bartle's job is not easy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Bar\u0131\u015f Tolon:\u00a0Game Design, Sound Design</p>\n<p>Kerem Aktuna: Game Programming</p>\n<p>Emre Elbir: 3D Art, VFX Art</p>\n<p>Yasemin Beddal: 3D Art, UI Art</p>\n<p>Ya\u011f\u0131z Erdemir:\u00a0Level Design</p>\n\r\n\r\nW,A,S,D: Moving \r\nQ: Rotate Body\r\nE: Interaction", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T14:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a4b65b6a4504d84d077285cda128831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BarisTolon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
