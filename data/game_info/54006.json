Pro-Am II is a racing video game developed by Rare and released by Tradewest for the Nintendo Entertainment System on December 11, 1992. The game is the sequel to the 1988 R.C. Pro-Am and features similar gameplay with a wider variety of tracks, currency-based vehicle and weapon upgrades, and bonus stages. In R.C. Pro-Am\u00a0II, four players, either human or artificial intelligence, race on a series of tracks to finish first while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The winner receives race points and money. The game features a multiplayer mode in which up to four human players can compete against each other simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Reviewers praised the sequel's additional features and variety, while others found its gameplay unoriginal compared to the original and its contemporaries. Critics lauded the multiplayer mode, which some said was a reason alone to buy the game. The game was released in Rare's 2015 Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T08:26:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/9093267d0dda6e6d8a3450427f265ded.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Tradewest"], "esrb_rating": null}
