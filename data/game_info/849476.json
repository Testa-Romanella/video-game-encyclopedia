The attack can be held to increase its power, but there is also the possibility of using energy tokens to reach the full charge instantly.<br/>\r\nWhen played with the joystick, the left stick is used for movement and the right stick is used for aiming.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are also several special interactions to spice things up.<br/>\r\nFor example, blocking a ball only reduces the damage, but doing it with a perfect timing will catch the ball and restore the energy token to the receiver.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis project is still early in development and I am currently working on:<br/>\r\n-Online multiplayer (Photon PUN)<br/>\r\n-Several power-ups that players can use.<br/>\r\n-New game modes", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T04:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d00/d00a7badb11b3de2e8fd406f35bda379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infern"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Infern"], "esrb_rating": null}
