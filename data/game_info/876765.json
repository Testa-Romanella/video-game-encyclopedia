During the production of our project, I was able to participate in the Game Design part of the game including the lore, the story, as well as the universe of it and its dialogues. I was also able to be in charge of the development of the different levels of the game as well as responsible for the Sound Design and the interfaces as well as the navigation through them.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredits :\r\n3D Modeling : DEJEAN Antoine, FAVRE Steven, GAUDICHON Erwan\r\nAnimation : AUDEON Yvain\r\nProgrammation &amp; Integration : DEJEAN Antoine\r\nLevel Design : FAVRE Steven, CADORET Titouan\r\nGame Design : FAVRE Steven, AUDEON Yvain, CADORET Titouan\r\nUI &amp; UX Design : CADORET Titouan\r\nSound Design : CADORET Titouan", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T08:33:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1a1b8f27ed25acabb85e05042168090.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Titouan CADORET"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
