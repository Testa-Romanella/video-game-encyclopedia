Gruelling conditions.</p>\n<p>Enough is enough.</p>\n<p>You and your coworkers have banded together in a union to achieve better pay and conditions at work. When negotiations failed, there was only one thing left to do - strike! With a picket solidly in place around the factory, you must fight off scabs, dodge the strikebreakers, and pool funds with your supporters to refill the strike fund. Who's gonna have the stronger will - the boss, or the union?</p>\n<p>Now with extra Sabo-Tabby!</p>\n<p>This is my first fully completed project\u00a0(though I've got years of modding and quite some time with WIP projects under my belt), and I'm quite happy with how it's turned out! It's short and sweet, but it's more fun to play than I\u00a0honestly expected. I've made this from scratch (sans the background music, which is courtesy of Coscmic Famicommunist,) in about four days of hyperfocus. It's 5:30 AM now. I'm gonna go to sleep. This game basically just posessed me for 72 hours straight and demanded I finish it, so I'm gonna go catch up on some sleep. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T05:31:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c20/c20859173e9fde4e14a42f5dee3b893c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mira Gale"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
