There are 10 levels in total. Within each level are a number of collectable items, some are useful, while others are... not so useful :-)</p>\n<p>Written predominantly in BBC Basic, with some elements of 6502 assembly language for sprite plotting, the game runs in four colour MODE 5, a low resolution (640 x 256 pixel) display which used 10k of the BBC Micro's memory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:23:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1af2e500d85132bf96935caa735a801.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sassquad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
