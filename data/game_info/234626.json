Try to capture as many blocks as possible and become the number one on the leaderboard.<br/><br/>In splix.io your objective is to capture as many blocks as possible, draw a line around an area and get back to your own land in order to capture the area. But watch out, because if anyone touches your line before you reach your own land, you die.<br/><br/>Also you know what's cool? It's against actual other players. Yeah that's right, that's why the lag is there. It's actually online, unlike some paper-ish apps where you're just playing against a bunch of bots.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b42/b42e76e443b0c7c6fc12497ac6373c31.jpg", "website": "http://splix.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jesper The End"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Jesper The End"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
