They have all but disappeared from the land, taking their secrets with them, but the Great Tapestries they created in their heyday have kept Mysteria from harm... until now. <br/><br/>With the Great Tapestries fraying and darkness returning to threaten Mysteria it's up to you, the last Pictomancer, to quest throughout the kingdom and restore these powerful images and save the kingdom.
