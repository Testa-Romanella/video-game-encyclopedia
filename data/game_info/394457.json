I like to play them every now and then while I'm working at my computer. They're short, fun (I hope) and the coding went fairly well in my opinion, especially the sound, which is created in code. <br/></p>\n<p>The music is different each time you start the game. It is created randomly from an array of notes, but always harmonic. The game creates one melody at the start of a scene and plays it repeatedly. One day I might do something more with that idea.</p>\n<p>I didn't feel like creating special background images for this one, so I just used some of my pictures from a trip to Naples and Pompeji.</p>\n<p>The mini games are:</p>\n<p>- a game in which you hear a note from a one octave scale and you have to guess the right note</p>\n<p>- a game in which you have to click on the checksum of a number displayed</p>\n<p>- a word game with different words appearing on the screen and you have to click on the words with a horizontal or vertical axis</p>\n<p>- a game in which you have to left-click on floating dots in the color of a central word and right-click on all others while ignoring the meaning of the word that you see</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:06:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/21121503c741c1f794c746c18fddbaf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
