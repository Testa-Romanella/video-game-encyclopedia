The constant incursion of humans, into the forest of the monsters,pushes them further and further back to the center of the forest. The middle of the forest houses the Well of Life. Legends say the water of the well can heal wounds and can cure any illness and a powerful mage can turn the water of the well into a potion of eternal youth. That is why the humans are constantly attacking the forest and the monsters. They destroy the forests and every creature in their way to obtain this mighty gift of nature.</p>\n<p>Between all those Monsters there are three siblings. In distress, they gathered all monster clans together, to defeat all human intruders and to finally live in peace together.</p>\n\n<p>There will be most likely an update or more :)<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left Mouse Click: Select tile, build tower on tile<br/>Right Mouse Click: Move Selected Monster to mouse position<br/>1,2,3: Select Monster<br/>Q: Previous Monster<br/>E: Next Monster<br/>F: Deselect all monsters<br/>ESC / P: Pause Menu<br/><br/>Day Camera:<br/>Click + drag: look around,<br/>WASD: move<br/>Scroll Wheel: Up / Down<br/></p>\n<strong>Credits</strong>\n<p>Programming &amp; VFX<br/>Elias Kunde</p>\n<p>2D/3D Environment Art &amp; Level Design<br/>Eva Welzbacher</p>\n<p>2D Character Art &amp; Animation<br/>Maria Wernicke</p>\n<p>2D Character Art &amp; Animation<br/>Bich Hang Pham</p>\n<p>Storytelling,<br/>Audio &amp; SFX<br/>Niklas M\u00f6ller</p>\n<p>used Software:<br/>Unity 3D Engine<br/>Blender 3D<br/>beepbox.co<br/>font Rainy Hearts from Camellina www.dafont.com</p>\n\n\n<strong>Used Packages</strong>\n<p>Text Mesh Pro<br/>Cinemachine<br/>2D Sprite<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Used Tutorials:<br/></strong>a* for unity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKKpPmxx07w<br/>(not directly but i learned stuff from Brackeys Tower Defense series that is probably used in some ways here)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e32c3b727d3af6074b3ea9a4de442fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ererbe"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
