It plays like pong, mixed with the classic Brick breaker. <br/></p>\n<p>If you wanted to play a fresh game of Pong, but felt like you needed something a little different, this could be the game for you. It features an *insane* new feature where you must hit bricks to get points, and can increase the size of your paddle with circular boosts. After getting through the brick breaker game you play the game as a normal game of pong. <br/></p>\n<p>This is an old game I made back in 2017 for school. <br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\r\nPlayer 1:\u00a0\r\n<p>W - up<br/>S - down<br/></p>\r\nPlayer 2:\u00a0\r\n<p>Up Arrow - up\r\n<br/>Down Arrow - down<br/></p>\r\nPlayer 1:\u00a0\r\n<p>Hitting a brick - 1 point<br/>Scoring on player's side - 5 points<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87ff32d55d128fdb389ec49a3c89ce9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gilexarr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
