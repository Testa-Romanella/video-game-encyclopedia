The goal is to kill all the enemies by collecting the stars which produce a laser beam.\u00a0The direction of the laser beam depends on your direction of motion. Killing enemies as fast as possible is not the best choice, as the score depends on the combo value shown at the bottom of the screen. The bigger the combo the higher each enemy score. The highest combo value is 5 which will produce lasers to clear the whole playing field.</p><p>The game is inspired by the awesome games of\u00a0@TomSennett:\u00a0Ultralight Beam and Deepak Fights Robots :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e63/e633b9509d79980a3a4acb37193c7579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ahmed Khalifa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
