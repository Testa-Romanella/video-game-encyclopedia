{"id": 56603, "slug": "lazy-jones", "name": "Lazy Jones", "name_original": "Lazy Jones", "description": "<p>Lazy Jones is a computer game for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, MSX and Tatung Einstein. It was written by David Whittaker and released by Terminal Software in 1984. The Spectrum version was ported by Simon Cobb.</p>\n<p>Lazy Jones is essentially a collection of fifteen smaller sub-games. The game takes place inside a hotel with three floors, connected by an elevator. The character is a lazy hotel employee who does not much care for his work, but prefers to sneak into the rooms to play video games instead.</p>\n<p>The main screen in Lazy Jones is the hotel interior. There, the character can use the elevator to travel freely between the three floors, but he must watch out for enemies: the current hotel manager on the top floor, the ghost of the previous manager on the bottom floor, and a haunted cleaning cart on the middle floor. The enemies only walk around and do not pursue the character, but contact with them is fatal.</p>\n<p>Each floor has six rooms, three on each side of the elevator. Each room can be entered once. Inside most rooms is a video game, which the character immediately begins playing. As well as the video games, there is the hotel bar, a bed, a cleaning closet and a toilet. The bar works like a video game, but the bed, the cleaning closet and the toilet are useless decorations (intentionally added, because David had run out of ideas for new games).</p>\n<p>When all rooms have been visited, the game starts over again, but increasingly faster, each time.</p>\n<p>One of the tracks of Lazy Jones's soundtrack, \"Star Dust\", was sampled by German electro project Zombie Nation for their 1999 hit single \"Kernkraft 400\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1984-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a4/5a41b19240d0bf2a32fa39772eeff2c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["David Whittaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Terminal Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
