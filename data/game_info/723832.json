The worst game in the world! Once a scratch game, now technically still a scratch game because I used turbowarp packager. Anyways, the art style is bad on purpose, so don't complain about that. This is a dumpster disguised as a game, so even if you download for some reason, don't donate. please. But Blob is a (relatively) fast paced game, where you dodge other blobs and try to work your way up to taking down the almighty plasma blob.</p>\n<p>This game includes:</p>\n<p>-3 levels</p>\n<p>-3 boss battles</p>\n<p>-2 Elite boss battles\u00a0</p>\n<p>-4 unique music tracks\u00a0</p>\n<p>-A lot more!</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Main Theme:\u00a0Ultimatum (Video Game Boss Fight Music) - YouTube</p>\n<p>Invisible Blob, Plasma Blob, And Flaming Blob Themes (All-out attack, The army of Minotaur, Saga of knight respectively):\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/makai-symphony</p><p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/hWgrtQnUG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37c19ded8cfcd8f0be25ef2745d19646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Imadumdum17"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
