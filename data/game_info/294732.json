It took me the span of the jam (basically whatever free time I had) to make the game go from paper to PC. The sprites were made using the in-house Game Maker Studio 2 sprite editor and Aseprite (for the logos mostly). The sounds were made using GarageBand on my iPhone, and overall I had fun making this. I hope you all enjoy and it would be great to hear feedback! Thanks again and stay tuned!</p>\n<p>- Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92e/92eda0094fda102277c5f4b1f440317c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
