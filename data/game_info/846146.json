It can be boring at start of it, but when somebody try to reach score greater than 10 he will be surprised. It is not easy to reach this value. This game has gained the inspiration from game called \"flappy bird\" where you are basicly able to reach 20 points, but only small procent of players can reach 100,200 and even more. Like in <strong>Yeto.\u00a0</strong>Is is very easy to reach 3,4,5 but not even more... If somebody wants to reach the best he/she/another needs to be very patient, have nice time reaction and also manage its economy.</p><p><strong>Turotrial</strong></p><p>Use [wsda] keys to move around, press [space] to shoot.</p><p>Right after you have joined the game you need to fight against red ducks and avoid the knifes (minecraft swords) flying around.
