There will be many obstacles in the way. Strange critters and mutants straight from a nightmare will provide the crew with many adversarial challenges. Our heroes must tough it out in this thrilling adventure.<br/></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>A chapter based game with four chapters in total. Beating the game should take you about an hour or two. So it won't be that long of an adventure.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>A 2D rpg with turn-based battles, it's your typical RPG Maker affair. However, you don't need to sweat about any of those pesky, annoying, and boring random encounters. You'll be able to see all the monsters on screen. Giving you the option to either fight, or run away. Isn't that nice?<br/></strong></em><em><strong>You'll be given a journal that updates throughout your journey. So you're never confused on what the next objective is. As well as a book that gives statistics and slightly funny descriptions on the various monsters you encounter.</strong></em><br/><br/><em><strong>So what are you waiting for? Play the game and stop Creature Corp from fulfilling Doctor Marty's demented goals! It would be great if you left me a comment. I worked hard on the game. Report any bugs as well. Thank you for reading! (And playing!)</strong></em><br/><br/><em><strong>Sorry for any cringe...</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T04:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/956e795a645ed503d27a626619e27b70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aNobody101"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
