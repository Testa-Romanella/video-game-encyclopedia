My goal for Finish Your Game Jam in this\u00a0early build was to figure out enemies in this game and figure out some of the gameplay. \u00a0This is an unfinished demo, but if you can beat the Druid at the end of the last room, consider that a win for the Knight.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD/D-PAD:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moves the Knight.
