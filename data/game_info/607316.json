Instead of drawing from a popular science-fantasy media, the Outcast is built from the darker, grungier, and less heroic media that still takes place in and around space.</p>\n<p>The Outcast might not fit with your Galactic 2e game. As with anything, you should speak with your group about it and discuss things. Playing the Outcast lets you \"<em>be the bad guy</em>,\" but doesn't give you leave to act like an asshole.</p>\n<p>You should use the Outcast playbook to highlight the other characters, either their heroic actions, or their potential to give in while under pressure. You may be a lone wolf, but you shouldn't try to steal scenes or be unstoppable. Instead, show up at the most opportune times, and leave other characters in a lurch when things get bad. As long as everyone's having fun.</p>\n<p><em>Play the Outcast if you want to be a supporting character amongst the group, providing a dark shadow to their heroic ways\u2014and perhaps tempting a few of them to turn inwards to their own deadlier instincts.</em></p>\n<p>All of the words and the art are by me. This playbook is not supported or endorsed in anyway by Galactic 2e or Riley Rethal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T11:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82d2a18cb020b6be07c61375b6b87886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eldritch mouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
