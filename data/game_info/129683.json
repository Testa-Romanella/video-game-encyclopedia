{"id": 129683, "slug": "the-chosen-one-josh-arnold", "name": "The Chosen One (Josh Arnold)", "name_original": "The Chosen One (Josh Arnold)", "description": "<p>Welcome to \"The Chosen One.\"<br/><br/>This game has been in the works for several months, and I have been focusing on the engine mechanics.<br/>All artwork are placeholders for when I hire a professional artist (I have one chosen out and he's\u00a0<em>really\u00a0</em>talented.)<br/><br/>The game will follow an epic quest to deliver a magical crystal to the top of a volcano where it is to become one with the land in order to balance the evil that is taking over.</p>\n<p>The Crystal has a magical ability to revive The Chosen One and his allies upon death, so it is crucial that it is protected.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br/>The gameplay will have many different aspects, focusing on the feel of a Sidescrolling RPG Adventure. But will introduce elements of tower/castle defense in special parts of the story. You will have to slay many epic bosses during your adventure, and cross many landscapes. While you do this, your character will level up, and unlock new abilities/powers, and find ways to make money to buy new gear. The clock is ticking though, each day, the enemies become more evil and powerful, so the game will need to be completed with some strategy and no delay.<br/><br/>There will be many ways to fight off enemies, from simply mowing them down with your escalating power, to laying traps and defenses, or letting your team do the dirty work. You can make a base, and grind for XP, but be warned, the days will go by, so its a good idea to be on the move regularly.<br/><br/><strong>MASSIVE WORLD</strong><br/>The world of \"The Chosen One\" will be vast and will harbor many various biomes, towns, and dungeons. Some areas are for exploring, some for defending, and some for executing attacks on evil lairs/castles.<br/>The map will be linear in a sense, but have Labyrinths and Dungeons that you can enter, for quests or just to explore. Certain quests will require you to backtrack and revisit locations. Luckily, you will unlock powers that can make getting around a lot easier.<br/><br/><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong><br/>The game begins with a character creation component, that will be VASTLY expanded. For now, it is pretty limited. In the future, new enemies and NPCs will be created from the game's own character creation engine, rather than being hard-coded.<br/><br/><strong>EVENTS</strong><br/>In the beginning and randomly in 1 in 10 days, an Eclipse will occur, which results in more enemies during the day when it would normally be peaceful. There will be other events like this that will be random or follow a schedule based on region. Events like these will give the game extra variety and suspense.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><strong>After all of this, I want to emphasize that this is my first full length game ever, and I am currently in control of 100% of all tasks. From music, to coding, to artwork. Hopefully with a kickstarter later this year, I will be able to focus more time on the project and hire professionals to help with some of the other processes. Since I school is starting back up (my final semester! im so excited) Expect development to slow (not stop,) but I will be regularly posting updates on this page and on my YouTube Channel!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b22e51bfdf487bec40f3e7522ec2da3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Arnold"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
