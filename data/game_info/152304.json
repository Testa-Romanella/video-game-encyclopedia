Do 360\u00b0 on air to get speed boost. Try to beat your evil twin (yes you've one. Just complete the run to spawn him)<br/><em>This game is developed for Super Game Pack 1 in 2 weeks. Check out other games here</em></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>UP / W: accelerate<br/>DOWN / S: brake / air brake<br/>LEFT / A lean left on air<br/>RIGHT / D: lean right on air</p><p><strong>Pro Tips:</strong><br/>Try to stay on the ground to accelerate further (especially on downhills). Doing 360\u00b0 boosts speed for 3 seconds. Crashing cancels the trick (and not good for your brain health)</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>design &amp; code: Deniz Ayd\u0131no\u011flu<br/><br/><strong>Sound Credits:<br/></strong>http://soundbible.com/1810-Wind.html<br/>http://www.looperman.com/loops/?mid=hamood<br/>http://freesound.org/people/Slave2theLight/sounds/...<br/>http://freesound.org/people/hookhead/sounds/13750/<br/>http://freesound.org/people/Veiler/sounds/209872/</p><p>This game is made using the awesome html5 game framework Phaser<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a406e1d9db92c980e309f009b51c21c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["deniz"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
