After thirty years busy directing unprecedented features in Korea like First Love or Nowhere to Hide, Lee Myung-Se finally brings the lost project back to life through virtual reality. <br/>\r\nSet against the backdrop of a family of three moving to the outskirts of Seoul in the 1960s - where the director himself grew up - Father Is Gone questions the place of the father in the traditional Korean culture.        <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films.
