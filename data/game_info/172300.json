[gaming division] and YOU should vote for our game <strong>EVEN IF YOU NEVER PLAY IT</strong>!\u00a0 (It\u2019s a short game though, so you can play it too).\u00a0 Why vote for a game you haven\u2019t played?\u00a0 Well, read below to find out why you should vote for <strong>The Protest Vote</strong>!</p>\n<p><em>(Oh, and judges, there\u2019s nothing important for you here, so you can just play our game quick and move on to the next one.\u00a0 Thanks!)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Ok-everybody-who-isn\u2019t-a-judge, here is the scoop de scoop: we at Balloon Co [gaming division] are old herb and pepper seasoned competitors of this here <em>game making contest</em>.\u00a0 But, while in the past we were distracted competing with other game creators, we ignored our true competition: the marionette/puppet masters who keep us all in line:\u00a0 the Pupnetteteers!\r\n  </p>\n<p>No longer will we dance for their enjoyment! (Even though we were REALLY GOOD AT DANCING!) Today starts a new day, where Balloon Co. [gaming division] fights not for its own benefit, but for the common people.\u00a0 And not just the common people, but we will fight for the uncommon people, the mystic people, AND the mystic-foil people! With this game, we hope to bring nothing less than a <strong><em>revolution</em></strong> to the indie game contest community!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Why do we place our creativity under a yoke for the contest runners?\u00a0 What have they done to deserve our <em>obedience</em>?\u00a0 We remember the first contest in 2014: a contest that also had laws handed down from above.\u00a0 And yet, did the rulers who ruled over this contest bind themselves to the same standard we poor small game developers did?\u00a0 Nay, nay we say!\u00a0 And also no!\u00a0 For hark, they promised that the contest would conclude months before it ended up ending!\u00a0 They had the nerve to attempt to excuse this sin by saying <em>\u201cWe had more entries than we expected.\u201d</em>\u00a0 BUT, do you think they would have mercy on your soul if you broke one of their rules and had a perfectly good excuse, unlike their imperfectly banal pretense?\r\n  </p>\n<p>That is not a rhetorical question, even though it looks exactly like a rhetorical question!\u00a0 For we at Balloon Co. [gaming division] have answered it for you!\u00a0 During the 2015 contest, a sweet little Balloon Co. artist found some open sourced artwork online and modified it for our game, thinking not that they had done anything to anger the contest gods/goddesses/deities.\u00a0 Our lawyers even gave our games two thumbs up before we submitted our game, and we NEVER get two thumbs up from them!\u00a0 (We usually get a lot of thumbs sideways, down, and thumb inside the palm because it\u2019s clenched in a fist).\u00a0 When we got our contest results, we were gobsmacked at the score of 0 we got.\u00a0 Not even 0/10, just 0!\u00a0 Then, we were bauldergobsmacked when the only note given was <em>\u201cUnfortunately, the use of rips disqualifies this entry from the competition.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Now we at Balloon Co. [gaming division] were inraged AND outraged!\u00a0 We had become criminals!\u00a0 But we have a saying at Balloon Co. [gaming division]: \u201cWhen corporations give you lemons, make a broth that uses its acidic property to cure warts!\u201d\u00a0 And while we don\u2019t have any literal lemons (and thus have lots of literal warts), we realized we can\u2019t be the only inandoutraged game creators out there.\u00a0 So, we decided that, since we\u2019re hard boiled criminals, we should do our best to help out you sunny side up game creators!\r\n  </p>\n<p>So, has this corporation ever done anything rage worthy to you?\u00a0 Then VOTE FOR OUR GAME IN PROTEST:<strong> THE PROTEST VOTE!</strong>\u00a0 Has this corporation ever disappointed you?\u00a0 Then VOTE FOR OUR GAME!\u00a0 Have you been treated well by this contest?\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re warning you, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u00a0 Absolutely, absolute power absolutely corrupts absolutely, <strong>absolutely!</strong>\u00a0 We need<strong> checks and balances!</strong>\u00a0 We need contest power in the hands of the game developers! If you are treated well, it is still completely at the <em>mercy</em> of a corporation hungry for money, and that good will could be <strong>withdrawn at any moment!</strong>\u00a0 Hark, notice over the years the generosity slipping away: last contest, <strong>any game engine could be used</strong>, but this year they are banished unless they bare the branding of RPG maker!\r\n  </p>\n<p>We need a world reborn, we need a revolution!\u00a0 And every revolution needs a protest for the people!\u00a0 And there is no better superhero to send against a greedy soulless corporate villain than your friendly neighborhood buddies at the Balloon Company [gaming division] corporation!\u00a0 Those judges don\u2019t want us to win, but we don\u2019t need their 7/10s.\u00a0 All we need is your support.\u00a0 We must put pressure so that the next contest allows more freedom!</p>\n<p>Are you happy with limitations on art?\u00a0 We\u2019re not.\u00a0 We want games with 18+ content, like filing taxes!\u00a0 We are missing out on much needed educational games on how to survive in the world once your age levels up past an arbitrary number!\u00a0 We want games that provoke the upper class!\u00a0 We want games independent from corporate interest.\u00a0 You know, <strong>INDIE GAMES!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of 8-bit drums, it is the music of the game creators who will not be pupnettes again! \u00a0With your support, we can fight for truly indie games by <strong>winning the people choice award </strong>and sending a message to those CEOs in their skyscrapers looking down on us, trying to <em>extract dollars </em>out of us rather than being wowed by our art!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Oh, speaking of CEOs, please don\u2019t tell our CEOs at Balloon Co. [management division] we are doing this.\u00a0 This is one of those<em> \u201cour lawyers put their thumbs so down they are buried in the dirt floor\u201d</em> kind of decisions and we could get in big trouble if they found out.\u00a0 <strong>Thanks for your secrecy!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/028/028d63de21856e89ec22e5e4049a8d4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balloon Co."], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
