Also you'll get an extra point if you make the plant eat them instead\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also this <strong>anvil </strong>things. First you see them in a magic bulb kinda thing. You have to <strong>activate them in order to spawn an anvil in that lane</strong>. Shortly after an anvil will fall and if you manage to make the plant get hit by it, you'll get 10 extra points also the plant will slow down for a little while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>DEV highscore : 749</p>\n<p>The `hard` difficulty gets activated after the 1000 mark which so far no one has managed to reach yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>everything here is done by me except some of the sound effects I downloaded from freesound.org and manipulated in audacity .
