Unfortunately, 5.5 of my 7 days were spent on stuff you can't see, so I had to leave out a lot of cool platforming and obstacle avoidance. My physics is pretty precarious so I'm sure a lot of people are going to break my game. However, it's still p. cool if you ask me.</p><p>\r\n\tI was extremely fortunate to have Mathijs Wiermans (https://twitter.com/Mjattie) make me 3 whole tracks. I've never gotten music from anyone else, so that was refreshing, and a huge time saver. Not to mention the music was really good.</p><p>\r\n\tAnyways, I hope you all enjoi. Th4x 4 checkin the page.
