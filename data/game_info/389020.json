You can imagine his excitement when Will Wright, the father of simulation games, demoed his latest game Spore to an enthusiastic crowd. When Spore turned out to be all game genres except simulation, Wessel decided he wanted to try to make the game by himself. The Sapling is the result of that attempt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d6/8d6caa65a7319d04b4fbd6cca0de624b.jpg", "website": "http://thesaplinggame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 4, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wessel Stoop"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Wessel Stoop"], "esrb_rating": null}
