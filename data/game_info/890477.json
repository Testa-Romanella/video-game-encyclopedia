Don't expect much, this is me just messing around with Bitsy for the first time. It takes 2-5 minutes to play.</p>\n<p>You are Noah, a kid who decides that today, he is going on an adventure. He ventures out in the woods armed with nothing more than a stick he found in his front yard and perhaps some other items he brought from his friend's house. <br/></p>\n\n<p>You can interact with black items. Follow the purple stones. The doors to your friend's house may be purple, but you can enter there too.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce68a960f2fc071a2e83b911bc6c1fd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
