The gameplay is in a style never seen before in a FNAF fan game :)\u00a0 I know I said I wouldn't make more FNAW games, but minds can change, and mine did. Fan games aren't hurting anybody, right? They're something I have fun making, and I choose to share them with you to play for free if you feel like it. So I don't feel this should be a bad thing for anybody.\u00a0<br/>The game takes places entierly on a TV screen... but is it real? Or are they just a dream? This is most likely them most challenging FNAW game out of them all. Can you beat all nights, and unlock the secret, new gamemode?\u00a0<br/>Music in the game is made by me, most pictures are from Google Images, and models are from Brawl with mostly custom made animations by me.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>You can also check out the FNAW Wiki here: http://five-nights-at-warios-fangame.wikia.com/wiki/Five_Nights_At_Warios_fangam...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/02942b087d98f2a9bacb09a31cd5c05d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["WwwWario"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
