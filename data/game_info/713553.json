{"id": 713553, "slug": "santas-rats-issue", "name": "Santa's Rats Issue", "name_original": "Santa's Rats Issue", "description": "<p>- in the original version there's a problem with the keyboard usage because I added <strong>Z</strong> as DOWN while I've written <strong>S</strong>. Z works, S not. In the updated version\u00a0(\"<strong>cheat</strong>\") you can use both.</p><p>- <strong>exploding gifts give you more points</strong>, so if you can it's better to take them in order (after a trembling one check where's the new next one)<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>rats and bats defeat you with a single touch</strong>, so watch out when you jump even for animals moving on the\u00a0above level</p>\n<p>- in this first release of the game, you'll have<strong> only three different levels</strong> to play with - but after that, you'll be able to keep on playing them again with a reduced time (you can go on trying to beat your record as long as you're able to)</p><p>- \"<strong>cheat</strong>\" version is the same as the original one but for that fix AND because pressing F7 on one specific moment during home\u00a0let you enter in a cheat page where you can select from which house you want to start, if you want unlimited time or unlimited lives. I think that spoils the fun, but I know for direct experience that one may want to use\u00a0cheats - so who am I to object to that?<br/></p>\n\n<p>Some more unspecific notes:</p>\n<p>- this game has been developed using <strong>CC65 </strong>compiler (https://www.cc65.org/)</p>\n<p>- resources have been made using <strong>SpritePad Pro</strong> (https://subchristsoftware.itch.io/spritepad-pro), <strong>CharPad Pro</strong> (https://subchristsoftware.itch.io/charpad-pro), <strong>Goat-Tracker</strong> (https://sourceforge.net/projects/goattracker2/) and <strong>Aseprite </strong>(https://www.aseprite.org/)</p>\n<p>- this game has been inspired by countless 8bit/16bit and/or arcade games but it would be unfair if I forgot also to tribute the more recent\u00a0<strong>Darkula </strong>by <strong>Locomalito </strong>(https://locomalito.com/darkula.php) as a source of inspiration</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:59:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb643aaf37aaca4ffe71279d49494d39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
