{"id": 317331, "slug": "kat-squares", "name": "Kat Squares", "name_original": "Kat Squares", "description": "Kat Squares symmetrically designed games offer intrigue and challenge in your quest to discover hidden symmetrical image puzzles from a variety of randomly selected designs. <br/><br/>The game presents the Kat Squares icon image, which represents the image that is displayed in the puzzle matrix as you touch the correct hidden squares. The main objective is to discover the hidden symmetric puzzle design by touching the hidden squares (with a guess) and displaying them in the puzzle matrix.  <br/><br/>A second objective is to gain the maximum of 1000 points as you discover and design the hidden Kat Squares puzzle.  So, avoid touching too many squares, unnecessarily. This reduces your chance of scoring 1000 points. Not many challengers succeed in this quest.  The average challenger levels off at around 900 points, so you have to prove you are exceptional.  <br/><br/>If you are unimpressed with your usual unexciting mobile board games, download Kat Squares today for a unique, unparalleled and exciting challenge and addiction with Kat Squares.
