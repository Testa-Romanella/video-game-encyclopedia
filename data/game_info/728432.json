Use either your LMB, Spacebar or just a single tap if you're on mobile to launch the ball when it's attached to one of the platforms</li></ul>\n<p>I made the game as a side-project in my spare time and I wanted it to be something really simple, which you could play in your downtime just to relax, or maybe on the tram during your commute on your way to work.</p>\n<p>I took some initial inspiration and idea from the game \"Icy Tower\", which I used to play a lot during IT classes in high school to try and beat my friends.</p>\n<p>Even though you can play the game and all the major features are done, I am still looking to keep working on updates and new additions, just a few I have in mind for the future:</p>\n<ul><li>Adding an online leaderboard so you can see how you stack up against other players</li><li>More obstacles, like spikes and bombs, as well as more collectibles</li><li>Introducing cosmetics, like different backgrounds and themes for the setting of the game, various sprites or skins you could collect either through in-game achievments of collectibles</li></ul>\n\n<p>Currently, the game is available only on <strong>itch.io</strong>, but I have plans to release it on mobile( Android first and then possibly iOS as well ) after some more optimizations and fleshing out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T08:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/1384b77d99d0cf6dd57e8c24e33feea9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaetriel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
