Pressing the button turns block near the horizontal line\u00a0on that column\u00a0to blue \"standable\" block\u00a0, which instantly gives you point. If you miss block, it automatically turns into red \"untouchable\" block</p>\n<p><strong>Wow, fun game, I like it. Looks like you are an interesting creator, where can I follow you?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a twitter account, where I post\u00a0stuff about my life, mostly about game development. I'd be happy if you follow\u00a0LeKSuS</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Enjoy! Any feedback is appreciated ^_^</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:32:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a15387fe85282a23b0c70656542b6ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeKSuS"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
