If the machine is too <strong>unstable</strong>,a black hole will awake !\r\n</p>\n<p>Try your best to make the atom core grow !\r\n</p>\n\n<strong>STORY</strong>\n<p>The year is 20XX, technology has evolved. Maybe a bit too much. Some mad governments have tried to use anti-matter and black hole as an energy source and lethal weapon. Pap U, a peace organization, found a way to stop the cycle by creating an atom core big enough that it will absorb any black hole-inducing atoms, thus stopping the antimatter race once and for all.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as Peace Activist Takanaka. You have infiltrated one of the antimatter forge and managed to corrupt it to create the atom core. Your goal is now to make it big enough to save the world from human madness. Be careful, a single mistake will create a black hole and promptly end the world\u2026\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nTEAM:\r\n<p>3D Artist -\u00a0<strong>Tom Le Lann</strong>\u00a0@vorunah\r\n</p>\n<p>Audio Artist -\u00a0<strong>Ivan Duprat</strong>\u00a0@Garet\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming -\u00a0<strong>Kevin Pedatte</strong>\u00a0@kpedatte\r\n</p>\n<p>Brainstorming support -\u00a0<strong>Victor</strong><br/></p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<ul><li><strong>Left-click Mouse</strong>\u00a0to click<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Hold Left-click Mouse</strong>\u00a0to grab<br/>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:47:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e68/e6806d69ab6659b7c58220a39b0f4b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedatte"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
