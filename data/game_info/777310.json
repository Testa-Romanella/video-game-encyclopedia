Forced to flee the hunting world, the two of you take refuge in the town of Larkin, Nevada, where the title of town preacher is unexpectedly thrust upon you. Left the sole source of morality in a place rife with chaos and sin, whether that be spawning from the sudden increase in local deaths, the reclusive family that runs the mortuary and owns half the town, or the strange encampment of people just south of civilization, calling themselves the Children of Cain.\r\n</p>\n<strong>\n<ul><li>Customize your character's pronouns, appearance, skill-set, personality and background.\r\n</li><li>Earn the favor of and join different factions.\r\n</li><li>Befriend, romance or make enemies of seven different characters.\r\n</li><li>Develop and dictate a unique relationship between your character and their mentor.\r\n</li></ul>\n<strong>\n<p><em><strong>Wyatt Abrams </strong></em>[Faction: None] [Romance? <em><strong>No\u274c</strong></em>] <strong>[Wyatt's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Wyatt Abrams is the player character\u2019s mentor, whether it be scheming or hunting, or just surviving, Wyatt\u2019s taught them everything they know. Once a prominent figure in the Abrams family, he\u2019s been running with the PC since the incident that eradicated The Family\u2013seventeen years ago by the game\u2019s start.\r\n</p>\n<p>Wyatt and the PC\u2019s relationship is somewhat\u2026complicated to say the least. It\u2019s up to the player just exactly how complicated it is and how their relationship unfolds\u2013whether you make a friend, an enemy, or some mix of the two out of the PC\u2019s adoptive father.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Doctor Cyrus Sokolov </em></strong><strong>[M]</strong> [Faction: <em><strong>Sokolov Family</strong></em>] [Romance?<em><strong> Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Cyrus' Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cyrus, or Doc Cy, as he\u2019s often called by the townsfolk around Larkin, runs the local mortuary, is town doctor and operates as the local leader around Larkin, though, the office of Mayor has remained vacant for years. The apparent patriarch of the rather strange family that owns the local mine and most of the town\u2013Cyrus has taken great efforts to make friends with the townsfolk.\r\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s somewhat suspicious of the new Preacher upon his first meeting with the PC, and it\u2019s up to the player whether or not it\u2019s heightened.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dominic Sokolov </em></strong><strong>[M]</strong> [Faction: <em><strong>Sokolov Family</strong></em>] [Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Dominic's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Dominic is the youngest of the Sokolov siblings--and just like his brother Cyrus, he's a prominent figure around town. Dominic seems to know everyone and everything that goes on in Larkin, and he's dying to know more about Larkin's most recent arrivals. He works as Assistant Mortician down at the mortuary, though more often than not you can find him doing his daily rounds throughout town.\r\n</p>\n<p>Dominic is always down for something interesting--and if that means spending time with the strange new preacher that everybody's seems to be up in arms about--well now, won't that make the papers?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Celina Sokolova </em></strong><strong>[F] </strong>[Faction: <em><strong>Sokolov Family</strong></em>] [Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Celina's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Celina Sokolova is the reclusive third sibling of the Sokolov Family. Despite the misconceptions amongst the townsfolk, it\u2019s her that\u2019s the family\u2019s oldest. She doesn\u2019t leave the family\u2019s home very often\u2013it\u2019s rumored around town that she\u2019s been stricken with some sort of sun-related illness, others seem to have the opinion that Miss Sokolova thinks herself too good to be around the rest of Larkin\u2019s townspeople\u2013the truth however, is something much more complicated. Despite her reclusive nature, on the few occasions townsfolk have seen the Sokolov Matriarch, they\u2019ve noted her delicate beauty\u2013even despite all the layers she wears.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Jacob Nash </em></strong><strong>[M]</strong> [Faction: <em><strong>Larkin Townspeople</strong></em>] [Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Jacob's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jacob Nash is Larkin\u2019s only practicing attorney\u2013not that he has many clients aside from the Sokolovs. After passing the Bar exam, Nash headed out west in the hopes of making a real difference for the people there\u2013only to spend most of his days helping settle land-disputes, or notarizing the occasional marriage certificate. Nash has a fondness for the people of Larkin, but he\u2019s not so sure that the Sokolov family has the townsfolk\u2019s best interest in mind.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nash is dedicated to his work, inside the office and out, doing whatever he can to help the people of Larkin. Although his work keeps him busy, he\u2019s secretly longing for something more\u2013something that the new Preacher could help him find.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rose Holloway </em></strong><strong>[F] </strong>[Faction: <em><strong>Larkin Townspeople</strong></em>] [Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Rose's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>On the outside Rose Holloway is as prickly as they come. She\u2019s nice to look at, sure, but conversation with the Emerald\u2019s bartender doesn\u2019t come easily, unless you\u2019re one of the Sokolov brothers.\r\n</p>\n<p>Rose Holloway moved out west with her husband, but after he passed away upon their arrival, she has remained Larkin\u2019s youngest widow. Days running the Emerald have left her bored, stagnant. And, while she doesn\u2019t offer the new Preacher the warmest welcome to Larkin, she could prove a strong ally in the coming days.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ace </em></strong><strong>[Gender Choice] [</strong>Faction: <em><strong>???</strong></em>] [Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Ace's Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ace is the dominant figure in the Preacher\u2019s California days, the first real acquaintance they managed to make on their own\u2013someone outside of Wyatt\u2019s sphere.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ace grew up a member of the guild, raised by hunters and mercenaries in a life that almost mirrored the PC. Maybe that\u2019s why the two seemed to be so drawn to each other during the PC\u2019s days in San Francisco, whether that was as enemies, friends, or lovers.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hollis </em></strong><strong>[Gender Choice] </strong>[Faction: <em><strong>Children of Cain</strong></em><em>] </em>[Romance? <em><strong>Yes \u2714\ufe0f</strong></em>] <strong>[Hollis' Playlist]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hollis is a bit of an enigmatic figure in Larkin. As an emissary for the Children of Cain, they\u2019ve been one of the few of the group\u2019s members to make the long trek from their encampment up to town more than once. Tall, brooding and often silent, most of the townsfolk are afraid to approach Hollis when they make the monthly ride up to town for supplies, usually with a different group of Cain members each time</p>\n</strong></strong></strong>\n\n<br/>\n<p>Follow the Larkin Blog\u00a0for Game Updates and Bonus Content!<br/></p>\n<p>Support the Author on Ko-fi!</p>\n<p>Join the Discord</p>\n<p>Found a bug?
