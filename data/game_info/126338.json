This game came about after ditching seven or so other false starts. The last ditched game this idea was created from had essentially come down to sitting around on couches playing chill mini-games. The pink and blue couches from the Arabian Nights resource pack mixed with the sounds from the Festival of Light Japanese resource pack and thus Ladd Din came from the final \"do this one now or you won't make the deadline at all\" moment on the 30th.</p>\n<p>So in summary, that Humble RPG Maker Software Bundle gave me and my sister nearly a month of fun, hey, let's try to do this thing craziness. Maybe we'll keep going under different self-imposed deadlines. A million thanks to the RPG Maker community for all their plugins, tutorials, resources, help, wacky encouraging contests, tweets, etc.</p>\n<p>Hooray! Time to go sit around on couches and chill.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a27b0fb11d148d3d2a2c9221f1fdd9d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["princessdanger"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
