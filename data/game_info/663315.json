It has a number of levels, and should be a short (5-10 minute) fun little diversion.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game uses the mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>Click and drag blocks from the left-hand side to the grid to place. You can delete blocks with the x in their upper-right corner (if available), or by hitting the delete key.</p>\n<p>Click and drag from the white circles on each block to connect the blocks together. To disconnect a block, click and drag from the right-hand side of the connection (where it goes into a block).</p>\n<p>The controls in the bottom-left control the simulation. 'Play' continuously updates the blocks. 'Small-step' moves forward one update. 'Big-step' updates all blocks once. 'Stop' resets the blocks.<br/></p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Please leave feedback here or on Twitter:\u00a0@PTFortDev\u00a0and @red_inspyrade.
