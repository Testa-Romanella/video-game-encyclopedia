With space travel unlocked, worlds are actively being discovered in the far reaches of space. Many new forms of renewable energy have helped earth's longevity, but its days are still numbered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Texla CEO Kelon Tusk was instrumental in\u00a0leading these efforts. Kelon increased the world's efficiency with new technologies; specifically, the worker robot known as \"Tex-bot\" created in 2042. These bots were created to handle mundane tasks. Education rose to new heights, and innovation was at its peak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Until one day, the bots had been given too much freedom in their AI. They turned on mankind, slaying all in their sight. The rich and powerful were able to evacuate our world, but many others were left behind. It is still unknown to those who survive on earth if those who\u00a0escaped managed to save mankind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Adalberto was one of those left behind. As a 76-year-old electrical engineer, he has survived purely on his wits. His ability to construct things from scrap available in the world has given him a fighting chance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, Adalberto has finally completed his first bot, Roby (Roh-bee). With the right amount of parts, Roby could defend Adalberto from the evil bots.</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>In My Friend Roby, you pilot Adalberto, a 76-year-old man who is unable to attack. Follow Roby around, collecting scrap and upgrading him to defend you against the oncoming horde of evil bots.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong>WASD or Arrow Keys<br/><strong>Crafting menu:</strong> 'F' or 'TAB' <br/><strong>Pause:</strong> Escape</p>\r\nObjective:\r\n<p>Collect scrap to upgrade Robys primary systems. Kill bosses to gather rare materials. Spend the rare materials on new abilities. <strong>Survive until you have killed 10 bosses, ending the reign of the evil robots.</strong><br/><strong>Each run, you can only receive:<br/></strong>x2: Tier 1 upgrades (Batteries)<br/>x2: Tier 2 upgrades (Ram)<br/>x1: Tier 3 upgrade (CPU).<br/>Play the game several times, and try out different combos!</p>\r\nTheme Idea:\r\n<p>Our theme for \"Collaborating with AI\" revolves around our friend Roby. The game plays similar to Vampire Survivors, with the caveat that your PC does not have agency in killing enemies. You rely heavily on your collaboration with Roby!</p>\r\nCreators:\r\n<p>Drewk2525 - Primary Developer<br/>Mishtiff - Art, sounds, developer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d28/d28095df09ea5c8affb390cda0daa7b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mishtiff", "drewk2525"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
