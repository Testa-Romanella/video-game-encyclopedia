Well, host a trivia game, of course! Join the challenge of the<em> Thing Of The Void</em> (or <em>Thothev </em>for short) and go deep into the abyss to win big!<br/></p>\n<p>Put your knowledge of several topics to the test! Sports, history, science, anime, videogames and more! But since Thothev thought that just knowing wasn\u2019t fun enough, move around in his playground, collecting cards and increasing your combo! Cash out or go deeper, for higher rewards but possibly higher risks! Monetary, of course!\r\n</p>\n<p>Do you have what it takes to make it big at the biggest game show from the darkest pits of the universe?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Created for Ludum Dare 48</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Roll the dice and move around the board. If you land on a category, you\u2019ll have to answer a trivia question! Answer correctly for <em>V-Coins</em>! Extra points if you answer fast and even more if you answer correctly consecutively!\r\n</p>\n<p>Other tiles have various effects. Some even give you Cards, which you can use to make luck lean to your favour! Some cards can be used on the board, while others can be used during the trivia itself!\r\n</p>\n<p>Whenever you pass Start, you can Cash Out to end the game, and hopefully surpass your highscore! Or you can go deeper into the abyss! This increases the rewards you get by answering questions right, but also makes you lose money when you answer incorrectly. Do you feel confident in raising the stakes?\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Play a wacky trivia board game with an eldritch monster as the host!\r\n</li><li>A lot of categories! Sports, history and science, as usual! Video games and anime too, of course!\r\n</li><li>Collect cards along the way!

There\u2019s plenty to buy!\r\n</li><li>Make your own trivia to share with your friends!\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to do pretty much everything.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Want to add your own questions to the game?
