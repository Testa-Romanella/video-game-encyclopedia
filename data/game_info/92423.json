Having been obsessed with vampires for years she spends most of her time reading vampire themed books, thinking of theories to prove their existence and most importantly; being on the outlook to find one! <br/>\r\n\tThe latter has been rather unsuccessful \u2014 that is until Cherise finds Dalton and Aleisha, two people who make her 'Vampire sensor' overheat. Being full of excitement and hope she makes it her next mission to get close to them and prove once and for all that she isn't crazy like most people believe her to be.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn Genjitsukai you get the option to choose a route at the beginning and this will change the story you'll get completely;\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Special description for Dalton's route;</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn this route Cherise has recently spotted a (inhumanly!) handsome guy who <br/>\r\n\tmade her Vampire senses flare up immediately. With the sudden gut feeling she had to follow him, she chased him around for at least 30 minutes until he suddenly sensed her from a pretty big distance \u2014 this only being a confirmation to her that he is, indeed, something special. She tried to follow him home, but frustratingly enough ended up losing him somewhere along the road.<br/>\r\n\tBut then, a week or so later, she meets him again at the same shopping district. And this time she is fully determined not to lose him again.</p><p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Special description for Aleisha's route;</strong></p><p>\r\n\tIn this route Cherise meets a strange girl at her favourite bookstore, who makes a sudden remark on the specific books Cherise is carrying at the moment. Being offended by her description of it being \"unrealistic\" and \"a pain to get through\" \u2014 especially once the girl pointed out Cherise her favourite book of all time \u2014 she waves her opinions off and continues her way, but then suddenly it hits her that the way the girl pointed it out was rather suspicious. <br/>\r\n\tSuddenly being triggered by a form of excitement and curiosity she decides to go back and talk to the girl, only to find out that she is long gone. <br/>\r\n\tThen she made a promise to herself that, if she were to ever see her again she'd make it a proper discussion and try to figure out whether this girl was a vampire fanatic like herself or perhaps the key to finding out a truth she has always hoped for.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Features: </strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\t- 20,000 words (around 2 hours)<br/>\r\n\t- 2 routes to choose from at the beginning.<br/>\r\n\t- 4 Backgrounds<br/>\r\n\t- 8 CG's total, 4 CG's for each route.<br/>\r\n\t- 2 endings for each route (good and bad ending)<br/>\r\n\t- 17+ rating; sexual innuendo, mild nudity &amp; violence.<br/>\r\n\t- The story will take place in the span of a week.<br/>\r\n\t- There will be an option to choose the protagonist's name.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe team:\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\t- Story, Writing &amp; Programming: Michi<br/>\r\n\t- Sprites, Backgrounds, CG's &amp; GUI: Sasori<br/>\r\n\t- Music (Royalty free): Ross Bugden, Michael Riske\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>A Note from KagiProjects:</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe're glad to finally be able to share this game with you that we've worked so very hard on in the past month.
