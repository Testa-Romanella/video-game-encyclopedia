Save up, save up!</p>\n<p>Project Idea: I developed the idea for this game when I\u00a0thought about designing something around a shared experience, something very pertinent to myself and others around me.\u00a0The housing crisis is a real crisis and the game highlights the difficult nature of being able to save for a deposit when at times you feel like jumping through hoops. Literally, this game has you jumping and running to scrape together your deposit, all the while being chased and hunted by an evil stalker. The game is more cinematic than a traditional platformer and provides an overarching concept for a larger title in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>How to Play: This game follows the traditional WASD keys for movement, SPACEBAR for jumping, and SHIFT to run.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:18:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/9694e1a60df890367acd254a25240bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brandondavies"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
