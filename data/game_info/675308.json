So if you see something that seems unfinished, that's because it is! When the full game releases there will be much more polish than what you see now.\r\n</p>\r\nThis game is still a horror game!\r\n<p>If you've never heard of Baldi's Basics before, it's important to know that this is not actual edutainment, but it is, in fact, a tongue-in-cheek horror game.\u00a0It's family friendly, but still includes some things that could scare players.\u00a0This demo\u00a0<strong>is</strong>\u00a0relatively light on horror-type content though, and the full game will have much more than what is seen here.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD -\u00a0Move\r\n</p>\n<p>Mouse - Turn\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift - Run\r\n</p>\n<p>Space -\u00a0Look behind you\r\n</p>\n<p>Tab - View map\r\n</p>\n<p>Left click -\u00a0Interact\r\n</p>\n<p>Right click - Use items\r\n</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel -\u00a0Change items\r\n</p>\n<p>Use the control mapper to change these controls to your liking!\r\n</p>\r\nSettings\r\n<p>Hold SHIFT when launching the game (Options on Mac) to access the settings. Here you can switch between full-screen and windowed, and select the resolution.\u00a0Do not change the input settings however! Changing any inputs\u00a0within the settings window may break the in-game controls.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the game you can find more settings by clicking on the options option.\u00a0Here you can change mouse sensitivity and volume, and re-map the controls to your liking.\r\n</p>\r\nPre-order the full game through Backerkit\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Visit the full game's Backerkit pre-order store!</em>\n</p>\r\nLinks\r\nWebsite\r\nTwitter\r\nKickstarter Updates\r\nYouTube\r\nMerch\r\n\r\n<p><em>Baldi's\u00a0Basics merch!</em>\n</p>\r\nFAQ\r\nWhy doesn't Gotta Sweep have a closet? Where's the You\u00a0Can Think\u00a0Pad? Why are all the faculty only rooms so empty?\r\n<p>If you have a question like this, the answer is simple: The game isn't finished yet! Like I said, there are still\u00a0<strong>lots</strong>\u00a0of things I haven't gotten around to adding yet.\u00a0Right now I'm at the stage where I just program the game so that everything works, and I'll worry about adding the finer details closer to the end of the game's development.\r\n</p>\r\nCan I make mods of this demo?\r\n<p>I love seeing all the mods people make of the original game, but with this demo being for what will be a paid piece of software,\u00a0I would prefer if any mods created for this were distributed without redistributing the game itself.\u00a0What\u00a0I mean is, any mods created for this should be shared by sharing the original files\u00a0<strong>you</strong>\u00a0created, with instructions that explain how users can install those files into their copy of the demo.\u00a0This is something that will be absolutely necessary for mods of the\u00a0full game when it releases.\r\n</p>\r\nDoes this demo have a secret ending?\r\n<p>I'll save you all the trouble and confirm that this demo doesn't have a secret ending.\u00a0The full game will have plenty of secrets though!\r\n</p>\r\nThis isn't very scary.\u00a0Is this still supposed to be a horror game?\r\n<p>This demo definitely doesn't have much focus on being creepy, mostly just on gameplay.\u00a0In the full game, I plan on ensuring the game has more creepy elements to it, although I don't think it will ever be \"scary\".\u00a0I'm going to go light on the jump scares (The Baldi jumpscare barely even counts as a jumpscare due to how predictable it is) and focus more and giving the game a creepy and unsettling atmosphere.\r\n</p>\r\nWill this demo be released for any mobile devices?\r\n<p>Nope, I have no plans to release this on mobile devices.\r\n</p>\r\nHave you pointed out that this demo is subject to change too many times?\r\n<p>Yes, but that's subject to change as well.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(I DO NOT OWN THIS GAME, I AM JUST RE-UPLOADING IT SO PEOPLE CAN PLAY THIS AGAIN, ALL CREDIT GOES TO MYSTMAN12 FOR CREATING THE GAME AND MAKING THE ORIGINAL PAGE)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:34:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/758/758b1fe26cbaf2c216aa0dfd499e18d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aidan's Stuff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
