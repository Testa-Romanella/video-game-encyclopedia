Originated from a comic i wrote, and it got it's first installment in 2017. Features a living Jumper, whose name is... Jumper! Later, still in 2017, Jumper 2 came out. Eventually 2018 would bring Jumper 3, and Jumper 4 would arrive in 2019. Since then, there have been a lot of scrapped projects, but the latest attempt at making a game, Jumper 5 has an actual demo playable. Eventually, i would take down Jumper games, because i wanted to remake it, but failed miserably, thus i'm now re-releasing it.</p>\n<p>You can download all the Jumper games here. It Includes the first 4 installments, + Jumper 5 Demo, and older versions of Jumper games, and some remakes.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T14:27:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbc014e49a937223a551e2384da1fc34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Asimuth"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
