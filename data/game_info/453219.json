{"id": 453219, "slug": "variations", "name": "Variations", "name_original": "Variations", "description": "<p>Variations is a small 3D game that combines the ideas of dodgeball and colour matching into a mental workout exercise. Dodgeball is a childhood classic that I've personally enjoyed and I wanted to take the fast-paced action of it and combine it with something else that requires thought and focus. If you misplace a step, it could be game over!<br/></p>\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>The player's color will indicate which dodge ball colour you must hit. If you hit the correct colour, your player's colour will switch.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move around. Space bar to jump.</p>\n<p>You can choose to jump over the projectiles or sidestep them, but make sure to not fall into the pit nor hit the wrong colour!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f1855de47ff4fa762db7549a1a785bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Venacyr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
