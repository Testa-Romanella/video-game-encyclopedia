This means your O2 will eventually run out, and you will perish. In the full version, additional O2 can be found, so you can continue to progress.\u00a0This should still be enough to give you a good taste of the full version.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aee/aee7820374d3d74b1e244c002ddfd71b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeremy Roberts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
