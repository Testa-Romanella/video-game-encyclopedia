(https://www.cs.iupui.edu/~ajharris/pygame/ch10/gameEngine.py)</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- AI enemies that track down a target (the players) and stand a certain distance away from them to shoot. 3 different types!<br/>- 2 player system. One relying on a keyboard and another relying on a game controller. The second player can also use an alternate keyboard control scheme if there's no controller detected.<br/>- Wave system that spawns more enemies difficult over time.<br/>- Regenerating health!<br/>- Supports an unlocked frame rate!<br/>- Option of 8-way or 360 degree aiming system! (for second player)</p>\n<p>Source Code:<br/></p>\n<p>https://github.com/BitlDevelopmentStudios/MAYHEM<br/><br/>Report bugs here:</p><p>https://github.com/BitlDevelopmentStudios/MAYHEM/issues</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Player 1:\u00a0<br/>Movement: W for moving forward, S for moving backwards, A for moving to the left, D for moving to the right.<br/>Combat: Move the crosshair around with the mouse to aim, and press the left mouse button to fire.<br/>- Player 2:\u00a0<br/>-- With a controller (tested on an XBOX ONE gamepad):\u00a0<br/>Movement: Move with the left joystick or the D-Pad<br/>Combat: Right Joystick to use 360 degree aiming, ABXY to aim with 8-way controls, Right Trigger or Right Bumper to fire.<br/>-- Without a controller:\u00a0<br/>Movement: Up Arrow for moving forward, Down Arrow for moving backwards, Left Arrow for moving to the left, Right Arrow for moving to the right.<br/>Combat: Press Right CTRL to fire, then use the movement keys to aim in any direction (8-way controls).
