The theme this time is \"Downhill\". I took this literally, and made the story revolves around a girl heading downhill. <br/></p>\r\nInspirations\r\n<p>I ended up listening to a lot of YeYe's songs this past week, and this one stood out to me. The game's story is inspired by this MV. I also played through\u00a0Celeste this last week, and got really hooked on its platforming mechanics.<br/></p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>The game's mechanic revolves around an umbrella. You jump higher and fall faster without it, and it could serve as a platform for you to ride. The umbrella also gets pushed down if you jump while on it, meaning it can be a versatile tool in vertical levels.<br/></p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>Here are the assets I use:</p>\n<ol><li>Palette: Nord Theme</li><li>Font: Silver</li></ol>\n<p>The art was made in Aseprite, and music created via Jump Box.
