This is the first game I have made and I wanted to upload it here to hopefully receive some feedback.</p>\n<p>I know a lot of things I could of done differently in hindsight. But, this is only part of the learning experience. This project has been a lot of firsts for me. All of the pixel art, music, SFX, and what not, have been made by me. Adding to that this was also my first time ever doing pixel art, music, SFX, you get the gist. So obviously those are things I can approve upon in future projects.</p>\n<p>The game itself is pretty simple, you just walk around and chop down trees to get wood and use the wood you collect to upgrade your base and craft trinkets. There is also a boss fight at the end. It's a pretty short game as well. In all actuality this project is just a way for me to learn Godot, and all the components that are involved in making a game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So please consider playing and leaving me some feedback, I really want to stick with game development and hopefully some feedback can point me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Also, the game is free obviously don't feel pressured to donate, I didn't do this for money I\u00a0did it to learn,\u00a0but if you want to donate feel free.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:35:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aace6fbd243b3ecb10ee030b76d23eb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D1Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
