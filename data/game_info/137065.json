It seems to have a bit of trouble with my DualShock 3, but you may have better luck. </p><p>It should also work with the Xbox One and Ouya controllers, along with some other generic controllers, but these are currently untested.</p><p>If you have luck with any of these controllers, please email or tweet at me (info above) so I can add them to the confirmed list!</p><p>From there on, discover for yourself. I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>NOTE: Upon completion, the game will exit itself, and reset your save to the beginning. This is normal, not a bug! If you experience any crashing mid-play, simply exit and restart the game as it will save your progress.</p><p>Font used (with permission, EULA attached): \"Orange Kid\" by @typodermic (http://typodermicfonts.com/orange-kid/)</p><p>Libraries used: Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), SDL_mixer 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/), SDL_image 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), SDL_ttf 2.0 (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/), and all libraries these inherit from.</p><p>All other game assets by Devin Raposo (@dtraposo).</p><p>Within is copyright Devin Raposo.
