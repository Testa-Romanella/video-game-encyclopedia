Ease bipartisan tensions by talking to your comrades. They will join your posse if they don't see you as an antagonist. ICE agents are unjustly targeting your friends. Use your posse to obstruct those ICE agents and get your friends to safety.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>One player controls both characters. You may also split the controls with a friend and try to coordinate with one another. This game is best played with a dual stick controller but WASD and Arrow Keys on the keyboard will work as well. Each stick on the gamepad controls one person. Each person has 3 hits. ICE will kill you immediately, howerver. If one of your players dies the game is over. Press the main gamepad buttons, or spacebar to start. Esc key to quit.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>The Soundtrack for Red White and Blue was created by Jimmy Q.

I am continuing development as time permits and this game could always use more playtesting. If there is interest, I would like to eventually port it to mobile. Please comment if you hit bugs or have issues. I appreciate your feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172136850373b845d71dc1f37c8a628c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Artfail"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
