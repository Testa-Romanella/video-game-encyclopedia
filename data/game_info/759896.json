Thank you very much! Screenshots attached :)<br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hordbrun is a tactical multiplayer fighting game with a focus on team play in harsh northern environments. The characters of the land of Hordbrun vaguely resemble the tribes and peoples of the far north fighting in difficult conditions.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Our game uses a rare combat system, which consists of precise infliction of damage along inclined straight lines, depending on the position of the character's body.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the weapon has clear physical edges, weight, and inertia.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All weapons and armor will wear out. Parrying and defending with a shield will also be controlled by the player himself. The character's movement speed will depend on the weight of the equipment and stamina units.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>She will play a very important role in the battle. Endurance will need to be maintained as it will be spent running, hitting, jumping, rolling, etc. Hand-to-hand combat with player throws will be implemented.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All players receive equal damage regardless of whether they are an ally or an enemy. Thus, a maximum of 2-3 players will be able to attack one player. Otherwise, they can interfere with each other. The environment is also important, the enemy can be pushed off a cliff, removed a tree on it, broken a bridge, etc.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Battles on ships will be implemented. The speed of the ships will depend on the number of players on the oars and the direction of the wind. Customization of characters: characters will be of different heights, which will add an interesting imbalance. Having different hairstyles and faces.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Many modes and locations. And all this in multiplayer! When creating a server, you can choose any mode, or customize your own. The game will have voice communication, which will depend on the distance of the players at the location. Opponents will also hear your conversation.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>There will be no shopping in Hordbrun, everything will depend only on your skill. Hordbrun is a game for real Gamers!</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are\u00a0very excited\u00a0about the future of this\u00a0project.\u00a0You can\u00a0help</strong><strong>\u00a0us make it a reality!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to you, some of our team members can work on the project on an ongoing basis.
