You are a police officer who is about to interrogate a protester girl. It's a harsh game with graphic violence, you are warned.</p><p>What I wanted to focus on is the police brutality and totalitarianism we suffer in Turkey. Atrocities those would be considered as war crimes are<br/> committed by Turkish police, against the very Turkish people, while most of us did nothing worse than protesting the government. We deal with a matter<br/> as serious as life and death. Utopia of a Tyrant is the artistic expression of my fear and anger.</p><p>Why I call this game also a \"mod\" is because I used models and textures for Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead series for renders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/5423177cb129f1d05c6b08fd0e823342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
