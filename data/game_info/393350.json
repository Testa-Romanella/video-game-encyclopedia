I'm uploading it here mainly as a joke with friends, but if you really want to play it go ahead. It is somewhat educational but I would not recommend letting your kids play it. The ending is also sorta meta. Overall, this is a pretty bad game, but if you donate more than a dollar\u00a0to me I will literally pin a photo of you to my bedroom wall.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, I was really tired when I made this so you have to manually quit the game if you die or finish it. And just ignore that photo of me at the end. Hell, ignore the whole ending. Actually, don't download the game it's really terrible.</p>\n<p>Also, there is no first game. I just thought the title would be funny.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the game has 3 levels and a super intense boss battle. WASD to move, mouse to aim, LMB to shoot, and you probably can use a controller to play as well. If you actually download this, leave a comment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/902/902672613db2199950b79e54fb88b9d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hman3825"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
