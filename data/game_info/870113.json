This is my entry to the Spooky 2D Jam '22!</p>\n<p>Here's how to play -\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are searching for a ghost (In a graveyard, duh). WASD to move. Your flashlight will start flickering once you are near the ghost. Once you find it, all the lights will come on and now it's time to run. The only way to be faster than the ghost is to run in diagonals. Find the door to vaporize the ghost.</p>\n<p>Known glitches - Sometimes the random numbers I use to set the ghosts location wonk out, and it spawns out of bounds. If this happens, restart the game. - Music won't play on the browser version, so if you want to hear the amazing music you'll have to download it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:56:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6bbc7aa709ad1dd430a3303c591ceaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheEPICArt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
