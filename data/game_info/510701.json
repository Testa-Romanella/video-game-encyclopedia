I made bots!<br/></p>\n<p>The theme of the competition was \"Stuck in a loop\"</p>\n<p>You can get the PDF with the full game rules and an optional score board that you can print and play on marcmagus's game page here. The digital version is not intended as a replacement, but rather as a quick game trial. <br/><br/>Perhaps you are participating in the ludum dare 47 event? If so you should leave a rating and some feedback on marcmagus's ludum dare submission!</p>\n<p>The tutorial is busted. It will be fixed in the next version. Sorry for the inconvenience.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a bug that I can't seam to fix. Unitys drag and drop sometimes fails and I don't know why. Its rare but it happens. I changed the drop event to a warning, but if a card doesn't get picked up then I cannot help you. You will have to restart. If it happens to you feel free to message me the debug report.<br/></p>\n<p>Art asset used by Kenney https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack</p>\n<p>Fonts used are open source: Orbitron and Liberation Serif<br/></p>\n<p>I want to clean up my code before publishing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a47528e0a8937089f01e75e13c0c4e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Voidsay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
