Great for getting your pawns out ahead, but moving two spaces leaves your pawn vulnerable to an en passant capture!</li><li><strong>Rook</strong> can build a wall in any adjacent square. A great defensive option, but only your opponent can take down your walls!</li><li><strong>Knight</strong> can capture pieces without moving into their squares. Sniper, no sniping!</li><li><strong>Bishop</strong> can become invisible. However, your opponent's possible moves will still reflect your bishops' locations, so a careful opponent will still be able to find you, and you cannot bait someone into moving themselves into check!</li><li><strong>King</strong> can stun a piece in any adjacent square. Zugzwang!</li><li><strong>Queen</strong> doesn't get a power because she is already so mobile.</li></ul>\n<p>Click to move pieces and use powers, hold space to peek at your cloaked bishops.</p>\n<p>I made this because I thought it would be fun, but I'm not a good chess player at all. If you're into chess and you have feedback on things that should be changed or added, please post in the forums!</p>\n<p>The font of the game status and logo is\u00a0Hokjesgeest by Tup Wanders.</p>\n<p>The restart and special power icons are by Font Awesome.
