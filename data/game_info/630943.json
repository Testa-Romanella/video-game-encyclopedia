{"id": 630943, "slug": "sorcerers-tiles", "name": "Sorcerer's Tiles", "name_original": "Sorcerer's Tiles", "description": "<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>You play as a student at the Academy of Magic, who is just learning how to create simple spells. After graduating and becoming a real wizard, you meet various other characters along the way to becoming a full-fledged arch-wizard. Your final objective is to defeat the dark wizard, who has been terrorizing the lands.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Each level consists of numbered tiles, each with one of three core elements. Your goal is to combine them in such a way that it produces your goal for that level. Combining tiles adds their numbers together and potentially changes their element, so you'll have to think ahead before you start randomly adding tiles together!</p>\n<p>The game is a relaxing brainteaser that\u00a0can be played with just a mouse. It's perfect for if you want to challenge yourself a little bit and aren't afraid of\u00a0some mental arithmetic. It features a total of 45 levels of increasing difficulty and complexity, to keep you entertained and challenged for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a continuation on\u00a0Appending Tiles, the game I made for the\u00a02021 GMTK game jam. I've added a story, better introduction levels and overhauled the entire look and feel of the game. Each level is now also hand-crafted instead of randomly generated. The music for this game was done by Steven O'Brien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:42:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09b/09bc13c85b472f3bb8efa7e4aa26d9be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WittyWare"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
