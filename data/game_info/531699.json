The last boss we had for our compony- well we don't like to talk about Ennard. We are now hiring! For a security guard just like you! We have came to the old burnt down house of the one and only Magic Turtle... Sadly we will never forget the day that Magic Turtle mysteriously died. Some say his best friend that was the cause of his death, but we know that he did not die because of him, I mean Ennard loved him like a brother. He even took his place after he died in memory of his best friend. He also made that weird animatronic, that.. he... stuffed Magic Turtles.. body into... He claimed that he did it because he wanted Magic Turtle by his side all the time. But, anyways we have went to Magic Turtles house, Turtle Manor. Since its burnt down, we are currently trying to rebuild the mansion! Why not help us! Become a employee today!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d1/3d1e419eec817a8a0044d3c3d40707c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Soysouce"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
