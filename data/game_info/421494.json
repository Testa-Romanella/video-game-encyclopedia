Therefore, due to all the factors of the game's mechanics, it brings a differentiated and well elaborated dynamic to the Player, making him have a new experience every time he plays. RENTAL KILLER uses Advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) for its NPCs, causing the NPC in question to be the imposter or not, to do different actions during the game, leaving the Player to use intelligence and strategy to find out which of the NPCs is the imposter and kill the same. \"- How do I know which one is the imposter?\", Well, it's very simple! The Impostor is the only one who obtain artificial intelligence differentiated from the others, he moves based on the constant position of the player, that is ... we can say that the imposter \"is the one who would be closest to the player\". however, with Rental Killer mechanics, this becomes much more difficult and fun! | RENTAL KILLER is still in development by MPGames with several constant updates every week.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:04:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/2974a275332a8e25ceaceed1058c7d63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MPGames Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
