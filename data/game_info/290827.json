Coming home helps with de-stressing from a long, work-inducing day. Manage your energy and stress levels to get through the day by taking care of yourself and your home. A Place to Call My Own is a meditative experience that seeks to capture the feelings and evocations of routines that we do to relieve ourselves after a long day.</p>\n<p>Sleepingbag Studios has come together to create a game that captures what home means to us. When brainstorming ideas, the common thread was that home is a place to let go of the world's problems for at least a little while. For our team, home is less a specific place or set of physical characteristics. It is the places we keep for ourselves. The places we call our own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/13484c645f83a23d8feab862de344224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jess"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
