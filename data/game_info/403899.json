{"id": 403899, "slug": "but-then-i-remembered", "name": "But Then I Remembered", "name_original": "But Then I Remembered", "description": "<p>But Then I Remembered is an interactive narrative game based on the Camp Fire which devastated Paradise, CA on 08 November, 2018. I, like so many others in my town, lost everything we owned. Some even lost friends or family members. For weeks and months after the fire, we told our stories, we asked each other for theirs, and through this shared experience, we came to know each other better. I\u00a0am making this game in an effort to capture that feeling for you, the player. I hope that through this experience, you will come to understand a little bit of what we went through that day, and what it is like to try to put the pieces back together.<br/><br/>Many people experience tragedies of this kind, and I\u00a0would like it if, after you have tried this game, you might see fit to be a little more kind to yourself, your loved ones, and those you interact with in public.<br/><br/>A note on payment. I\u00a0cannot accept payment in any way for the production of this game. I\u00a0am on a Student Visa in the UK, and their laws prohibit me from earning money through my coursework. Also, I\u00a0would not want to accept payment for this, as I\u00a0intend it to make a social impact, and would never try to enrich myself by way of other's tragic stories.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:17:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10a883c087f635e5cc7627f1e08b6a25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zen of Thieves"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
