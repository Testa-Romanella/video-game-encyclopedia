With simple inputs<strong> ( Move! Jump! Dash! Attack! That's it!)\u00a0</strong>with incredibly versatile applications, this game is built for anyone to enjoy, with nuance that the fastest and most technical of players will get a kick out of!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>You're put into the shoes of Neon, a Synthezoid who was created to fight against divided, robotic world.\u00a0\u00a0Synthezoids are androids who cannot be controlled by others, and wield power\u00a0far greater than that of most robots.\u00a0Humans in this world\u00a0either control the robots (therefore the society)\u00a0of their Territory, or are simply outcasts, left to fend for themselves during the next technological conflict, and Neon is the answer to \"the next conflict\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neon is as fast as YOU make him! He can dash at supersonic speeds\u00a0in all 8 cardinal directions,\u00a0 twice!\u00a0There is no double tapping a button to make sure you attack faster.\u00a0<strong>You will attack twice, on the dot.*\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>If you're familiar with fighting games, take your understanding of frame data and throw it out the window, because this game lets you cancel virtually everything into EVERYTHING! Make your own combos! Hit and run! Hit with the same move over and over! Unleash a barrage of punches like it's an anime reference! Teleport behind the enemy and end them with a charge attack!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>No preset combos to remember no waiting for animations to finish**, just hit and don't get hit and you'll win regardless of your playstyle!</strong></p>\n\n\r\n*You have to actually land your attacks though.\u00a0\r\n**Maybe SOME waiting, occasionally.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Playing this game at its fastest potential may make you impatient when playing mechanically similar games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:52:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da2959efdfdfc9bfa8922e715f29afc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["-NEON-"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
