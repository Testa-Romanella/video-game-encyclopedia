The program reads tables in a\u00a0JSON file whenever a piece of loot needs to be generated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rarity of the items goes up depending on which rank you choose. I\u00a0use a simple weight system to determine drop rates for the items. If no item is dropped, you're given a bonus that makes it more likely to get an item next time. Sometimes, a rare enemy appears that improves your chances of getting an item drop, and you get a larger bonus if no item drops.</p>\n<p>Monster sprites are from this asset pack:\u00a0https://sorceressgamelab.itch.io/extended-monster-pack</p><p>Loot bag is from this asset pack:\u00a0https://blodyavenger.itch.io/rpg-items-retro-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T07:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92dffa863ddc3e0320e1a86971f26a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mike Murray"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
