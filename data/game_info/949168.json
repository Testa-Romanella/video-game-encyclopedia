{"id": 949168, "slug": "apprentice-spellbook", "name": "Apprentice Spellbook", "name_original": "Apprentice Spellbook", "description": "<p>This game is a prototype made for a Game Design 2 class. The concept was that we needed to make a casual puzzle game based on the lore of the Misenchanted Book\u00a0Series (link to wiki:\u00a0https://ethshar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Misenchanted_Wiki). For our game, we were inspired by games like Little Alchemy and Doodle God. So that is essentially how our game plays, but with more fantasy items. <br/><br/>Team Members:<br/>Tanessa Howard<br/>Dominic Augello<br/>Gabe Goldsteen<br/>Robert Disbrow</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Hit the start button on the main menu to start the game.<br/>In the game click and drag the items on the top-right and put them in the red squares at the bottom of the page to combine them. Some combinations require two ingredients while others require 3.<br/>Right-click items in the red squares if you want to delete that item (if an error arises where you can't delete the item you can simply click and drag a different item over top of the buggy ingredient).<br/>The main goal of the game is to figure out the combinations for all of the spells on the right side of the page, when you've done that you can ALT-F4 out of the game if necessary because there is no exit button.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T14:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d8705315cece2658855413cde4706215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robby301"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
