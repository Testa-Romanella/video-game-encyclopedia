Run over these souls to collect them.</p>\n<p>When you die, you can spend your souls to upgrade either health, speed, damage, or fire rate.</p>\n<p>Along your journey, you may find Altars. These altars will change how your gun functions and can stack on top of one another.</p>\n<p>Try all the combinations! What is a spread shot mixed with a crossbow? How about a flamethrower mixed with a machine gun?</p>\n<p>Be careful though: when you die, your gun is reset to its normal form.</p>\n<p>Some altars will have enemies near them- these altars have become corrupted, and will not give the player an upgrade.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and see what kind of power-ups and builds combine the best!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T02:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddc/ddcc0c000f14cb3939edb62b4d7686c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rob Davis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
