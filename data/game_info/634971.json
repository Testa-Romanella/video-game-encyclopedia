I came up with an idea of comparing Star Wars to the episodes. That the Lion Guard are Jedi knights supporting the Resistance, and the Hyenas serve the First Order,\u00a0\u00a0and the Hyena's Leader,\u00a0Janja the Hyena (voiced by Andrew Kishnou) Is a Hyena Sith Agent and is Inferno Squad Commander. (also has comparison traits between Iden Versio (Star Wars Battlefront 2), and Starkiller (Star Wars the Force Unleashed)). And then I came up with an idea to make a video game of this comparison.</p>\n<p>To move Kion's Jedi Starfighter, press the arrow keys to move. To shoot, press space bar. To use Kion's roar of elders, press C key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All sound effects are star wars only. And don't forget to leave a like. :)</p>\n<p>(hint: one of the levels have the song by Sayonara Maxwell's Tonight We Strike remix from the Lion Guard)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T09:09:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/480/48053ce4202cf52f77b1a336ee6dfb93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tflores2020"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
