But this one video is just so<br/>good! Let\u2019s charge the phone and watch it! I\u2019m sure other people won\u2019t<br/>mind if you crash into their places and use their laptops, right?</p>\n<p>In JouleThief, you have to finish watching the video on your phone, which is running out of power. However, to charge it, you\u2019ll have to barge into other people\u2019s homes and disregard the collateral damage. The police will chase you around, but don\u2019t mind them. Just keep charging that phone!</p>\n<p>Move with WASD.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>@kroltan: Designer, coder<br/>@Moski: (Twitter: @the_moski) Art<br/>@jmm: (Twitter: @johnplzplaybass) Sound effects and music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa07d301c675f03cfb8b56a427da8646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kroltan", "The 'moski", "jmmusic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
