You move the triangle and dodge the obstacles, survive as long as you can. The game is endless but it has 10 phases, which means it goes harder and harder. You can collect the blue orb to enable \"orb frenzy\". When \"orb frenzy\" is activated, you are indestructible and you will get more score each second. You can also use orbs to change the background color of the game. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/370b348f5c76b3642d00a502c04e3ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jiayue Wu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
