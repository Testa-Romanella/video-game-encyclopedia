Here in the Ahmonas region, just south of the kingdom of Tanjil, lays a resort town called Layabout. Part of the Na'erdwell duchy, it sees a robust and sinful business.</p>\n<p>You are one Lady Siofra Whelan, a paladin working under the fire goddess Fyrshala, and you are here for two reasons.</p>\n<p>One is to escort the local elven dignitary Asahari to your castle for a continued peace contract renewal. The other is girls. You love girls. And women. Of all shapes and sizes and kinds. You live for it.</p>\n<p>Too bad that may be your downfall.</p>\n<p>Disguised as a janitor for the local brothel, Siofra goes into town to find an assassin that's said to be out for Asahari's blood. Can she stop them in time? And will she stay behaved or will she get distracted?</p>\n<p>Contains many many bad ends, a possible good end, a lot of hilarious hijinks, and maybe even a boss fight if you're lucky. Some secrets lay hidden in this small town, but even more peril awaits.</p>\n<p>Are you a bad enough woman to stop a possible political conspiracy?</p>\n<p>Made for Yuri Game Jam 2k15.</p>\n<p>Read the game's instruction booklet before you buy/DL here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f987a6afa7a8c0400f47cf2351d1afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atma Weapon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
