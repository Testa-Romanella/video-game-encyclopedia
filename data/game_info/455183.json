It's keyboard-only, and it doesn't drain battery or engage cooling fans.</li>\n<li>The game is designed so that you can come back to it after months of not playing. There are no advanced mechanics, only skill. Bookmark this page.</li>\n</ul>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>The two sounds in the game are free, CC-licensed.

If you see this on a page with ads, search for the original (Filip Hracek's LANDER) in your favorite search engine.</p>\r\nGame design\r\n<p>LANDER strives for a tight core game mechanic and almost no additional features. The goal is to have a game that you can play when you have 5 minutes, or 20 minutes, and have fun even months after you played it the last time. I avoided all artificial addictiveness (through things like variable rewards or cliff hangers) so that you can play and then stop without feeling bad about it.</p>\n<p>LANDER is as hard as you make it. Play it as a meditative experience, without worrying about score at all, or play it competitively for high scores or time-to-reach-score.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>\r\n                \u2014 Filip Hracek, filiph.net\r\n            </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaf/eafa588da1f6fd002a1c7da37f023c1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Filip Hr\u00e1\u010dek"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
