The story is based on a character that exists within a Living World called Pastoria that is home to many different multimedia projects including tabletop roleplaying games, digital games, interactive fiction, prose fiction and more. You can find more about Pastoria\u00a0here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T08:50:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb3fe671fdd5de1e85d68884f83c9999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["loremother"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
