He is searching for something, but needs your help to figure what it is. Features fateful choices, a puzzle area, health system, dangerous traps, secrets, and cats.</p><p>Dev Log: I worked on the game on and off during the weekend and Monday (about three days). I tried to keep it simple, but I ran out of time once again on this jam. I had to cut one area out and shorten another major path in the story. I also wanted to add more details and interactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Spoilers* My idea was to branch paths according to how many hearts you had left. If you go through the sewers you can actually get a lot of different endings depending on how many hearts you have left and how you answer the questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The avatar was originally a cat figure, but I didn't like how the cat was only facing one way so I changed it so it was facing forwards. I didn't want to create the levels going\u00a0only in one direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ea/5ea8a258428260c421d94fe2cd8a7d78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucky Pixel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
