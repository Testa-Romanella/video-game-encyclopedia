This is not present in any other room. I dread the day where I have to tackle this face on as it only occurs on the build version and I have no idea what causes it.</p>\n<p>Shown is an extremely primitive stage of the menu, along with a handful of scenes of which some operate better than others. Many minor and major additions/fixes to be made for these alone, not to mention the entire rest of the game. I aim to be done by 2060. Last 2 Screenshots cannot be found in game as they are just concept images.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T08:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0c/e0c76f0220aa7252d2e0a533cad4f4a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Breadstock"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
