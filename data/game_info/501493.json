Kill enemies to gain experience to be able to sacrifice an ability to evolve another.</p>\n<p>This game is unfinished, it is at a proof of concept stage. This is the first time I have made a rougelike so I had to take the time to learn how to make the game systems. Currently, I have 3 basic enemies, 2 bosses, procedural generated dungeons, and a difficulty curve.\u00a0 As you progress through the dungeon the difficulty and length of each floor will increase. However, there is no end to the game, its endless, and no highscore system in place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I might come back to this in the future to expand it but as it is now, I am currently tired trying to figure out how I screwed up the code.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Kenny Assets for art, font and some sounds: www.kenny.nl</p>\n<p>Music: Cyberpunk Moonlight Sonata by Joth on OpenGameArt</p>\n<p>Assorted Sounds: 512 Sound Effects (8-bit Style) by SubspaceAudio on OpenGameArt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f850b7ecc22124686a8b1ea676ede0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leucius"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
