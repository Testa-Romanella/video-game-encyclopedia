With no clear heir, who takes the throne is under contention. The Duke of Espea, the Baroness of Sucror, and the Princess of Vapleissau all clamor for the right to rule. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Sarah and her friend, Hans, are exiles from the Imperial Palace for the crime of disobedience. They may wander the lands now, but, they will find that their fate is intertwined with that of the torn-apart nation.</p>\n\n<p>This game is a tribute to the <em>Suikoden</em> series, and therefore borrows heavily from it. However, as this is a <strong>tribute</strong>, and not a fan-game, there may be a few things that are in those games that are not in this one, and visa-versa.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/860e3bf1add862a083bc92056a2847eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarrendReikan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
