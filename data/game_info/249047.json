In the most intricate style named Figure the pieces are shaped as animals, birds, fruits, toys, and other objects. <br/><br/>To make a puzzle easier to play, add the picture frame. To make a puzzle more challenging, turn on rotation of pieces. <br/><br/>To manage a vast number of pieces, you can use two playing windows. Use one window to make up a jigsaw and the other one to arrange or store pieces that you need not at the moment. <br/><br/>Select a group of pieces to move or neatly arrange them at once. To examine small pieces, use the Magnifying Glass.<br/><br/>You can save an incomplete jigsaw and later restore it. Up to nine puzzles in work can be saved simultaneously.<br/><br/>In addition to one thousand ready-to-use jigsaws, a jigsaw making feature is available.
