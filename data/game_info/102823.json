The rules are simple: get as high up the elevator as you can before meeting your fate at the hands of the enemies. Fight for the highest score!</p>\n<p>Jawbreaker can also be played with a buddy! Grab a friend and hit the elevator together as a team. Or, if you've got a score to settle, face off in Versus Mode!</p>\n<p><strong>Tips on Fighting:</strong></p>\n<p>As you fight, your special meter builds up. There are three sections of the special meter, each granting you a stronger attack. These attacks deal massive amounts of damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a special is used, the fighter will flash for a brief moment afterwards. This is the opponent's chance to do a counter attack. To execute a counter, simply hit the opponent while he's flashing. Counter attacks also deal massive damage, so if you're going to use a special, be careful you don't miss!</p>\n<p>-THIS GAME SUPPORTS GAMEPADS!-</p>\n<p><strong>***PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY ISSUES!***</strong></p>\n<p><strong>***I will do my best to fix any glitches or problems that are encountered!***</strong></p>\n<p>As always, thank you for playing!
