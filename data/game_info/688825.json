Fork!", "description": "<strong>Game Play</strong><br/>The player mainly acts as a tableware, perhaps a fork, by crossing obstacles to reach the food, and then completing the game.<br/>Drag the mouse to control the direction and strength of the fork's bounce, The player needs multiple attempts in some places to overcome obstacles.The goal is to reach the plate.<br/>But be careful not to let the fork fall to the ground.<br/><br/><br/>One day I suddenly wondered if I could make the usual process of searching for food into a game.<br/>It's like we always think about what to eat at noon and what to eat at night.<br/><br/>Turn this process into an experience.<br/>At home, or on vacation.<br/>Experience every wonderful experience of foraging, sometimes simple, sometimes difficult.<br/><br/>Enjoy the process.<br/>Maybe you will have a new understanding of eating later.<br/>This is pretty good.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T03:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f3032a1cd0b979507cdf3922aa0e07af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SHANHAI GAME STUDIO"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["SHANHAI GAME STUDIO"], "esrb_rating": null}
