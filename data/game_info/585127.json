You will steer your ship to avoid dangers for as long as possible.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The final attack has been launched on the Evil Eyes base, and you have volunteered to do the most dangerous mission of them all; to be a decoy. That's right, you will fly dangerously close to their base to get as many Evil Eyes as possible to attack you so that your allies will have an easier time engaging from the other side. Your mission is simple; survive for as long as possible. You are surely flying into your doom, but you will be remembered forever as a hero.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Control your ship with W, A &amp; D or with the arrow keys.<br/></p>\n<p>The Evil Eyes will relentlessly move towards you. If they get close to you (or very close to each other) they will initiate their self-destruct and as they explode, their Blood will be flung into space.<br/></p>\n<p>Stars will pop up from time to time. You gain a lot of points picking up stars, but for each star you pick up, an Evil Heart will spawn. Evil Hearts move across the screen spewing out Blood making the game much more difficult!<br/></p>\n<p>You need to dodge the Evil Eyes, Evil Hearts and their Blood for as long as possible!</p>\n<p><strong>Music and Sound</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music: Voxel Revolution by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/7017-voxel-revolution<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<p>Sound from: Mixkit https://mixkit.co/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T07:35:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf35b0642c18c5926f8f9cf4b578780b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Anciny"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
