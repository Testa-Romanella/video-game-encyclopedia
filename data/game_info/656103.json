Just as last time, it was a ton of fun but still brought us to the edge of failure. It was quite interesting to see how much we improved in half a year. But also again noticing some flaws, especially in the planning bits. But I guess this gets better and better with every game jam.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>For Heuerus, it was his first game jam, and it seems like we sparked his interest in creating things from scratch and doing everything by himself.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>We would of course appreciate your feedback on the game.</p>\r\nHave a great day,\r\nLeMixer Team and Heuerus", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:58:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b80dbfe6871b3654851d23b7068f2036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LeMixer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
