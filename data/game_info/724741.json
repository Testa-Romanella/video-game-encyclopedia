After the stars in the sky have been restored, the King of All Cosmos is in space, Then a meteor hit his head hard and the prince has to roll the katamari to restore the kings memory. New English port and Amazing gameplay!! Also note that the apk is not harmful it justsays that but I tested it out and it's legit. This is not a scam I promise your device is not at risk.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:03:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b404457c3b0d1e32ed75e99950f40b60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["DuckDuckMoose2"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
