Inspired by the likes of King of Fighters, Marvel vs Capcom, and Street Fighter, Blazing Worldstars is a quick paced, 6 buttoned fighter that looks to emulate the classic arcade feeling fighting games of the 90s were known for!</p>\n<p>You can follow for updates of the game here on Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BWorldstars</p>\n<p>And we have a Kickstarter Page that will launch this February that you can follow to be alerted when it goes live!:\u00a0https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blazingstars/blazing-worldstars</p>\n<p>The Alpha Demo has 3 fighters currently:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Mesmerle Staiguichi, a martial artist and stunt actress</li><li>Batrice Avegue, a washup heavy weight wrestler</li><li>Matthias Buragi, a rogue ninja with dark magic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Special Moves:</strong></p>\n\n<p>All characters can perform special moves tied to motion inputs, which can either be done via traditional methods for fighters or via more simple inputs through the leniency system. The leniency system is designed to help ease players into getting use to motion inputs and master them over time, as such requires muscle memory. It does not bar players from not being able to enjoy the game's deeper mechanics, but more so to encourage player growth through move tutorial systems with fun exercises in learning the strengths and weaknesses of each and every special move tied to characters. Ex moves can be used by using up meter from the Desperation Meter, Ex moves can be radically different from their original attacks!</p>\n<p><strong>Guarding/Parries:</strong></p>\n<p>By holding away from the opponent, players can block oncoming attacks, stand to block highs and mids, crouch and hold back to block lows. Blazing Worldstars has two parry systems, normal parries that allow for players to block without taking chip damage and likely respond with a punishing attack or reposition out of a situation, and Backdash Parries where back dashing will negate projectile attacks at the cost of some health becoming grey life that will slowly recover so long as they haven't taken damage afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Warrior Instinct:</strong></p>\n<p>Every fighter has a Warrior Instinct, abilities tied to the Enhance Meter system, by pressing MP+MK, a fighter will perform their WI at the cost of one Enhance Bar. Some fighters will have more than one Warrior Instinct with a different directional input tied to them and some Warrior Instincts may have ex versions by inputting 3P and 3K together. These can also be used by the Left Stick Button!</p>\n<p><strong>Enhance Mode:</strong></p>\n<p>Along with the Warrior Instinct, the Enhance system grants the Enhance mode that drastically changes the way a fighter plays and fights, granting either bonuses to stats, different movesets, or move properties. Enhance Mode can be activated once the Enhance Meter is full by pressing HP+HK, you might be able to turn an entire fight around within this state, but be aware that every Enhance Mode has a set timer to them. Enhance meter can be gained through dealing damage, taking damage, \u00a0hitting stingers, and striking after Warrior Instinct abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Stingers/Guard/Armorbreakers:</strong></p>\n<p>Hitting fighters when they whiff an attack with a heavy attack will set them into a crumple or heavy hitstun state known as a Stinger, you can follow up with another attack which will give a bonus to Enhance Meter growth. \u00a0Sometimes when opponents are blocking, you may find it hard to hurt them, but some moves can break their guards, allowing you to strike them or get past their defense, but these moves require certain criteria to pull off. Other times opponents can power through your attacks with armor, but some fighters may have moves that can shatter that armor to punish them.</p>\n<p>Overall, while there's a lot to Blazing Worldstars, these mechanics lean to a more friendly nature to get use to, teaching players that they have just as much access to the same tool experienced players have, learning to better your play and strategy against other players requires practice and experience by playing with other players and finding what tools you have to overcome situations you find you can't solve on your first few encounters. You can set the training dummy to reenact these scenarios to practice and experiment ways to beat them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T04:27:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4be/4bed887ab70b1bd96c1295b6d6f63813.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boujieshin"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
