The studio was founded alongside Moudy Hamo, Jack Steele, Stephen Boilegh, and Trevor Osz to make a game using their unique skills.<br/><br/>As a studio, <strong>Winterborn </strong>was formed to adapt the original tabletop game that the team played for many years into a video game. We all have fond memories and a lot of stories to tell about our time playing the game. Now is our chance to tell those stories and make the kind of games that we grew up playing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T03:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46dcee408164f58f4fde32b918ec4866.jpg", "website": "https://externusgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Winterborn"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Winterborn"], "esrb_rating": null}
