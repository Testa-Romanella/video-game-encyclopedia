I wanted to learn how to use Unity engine to develop games and Prince of Persia is one of the best games ever. Besides that, that game is one of the latest classics of all times developed by a solo developer (well, I know that is not exactly true for the PC version but at its origins in Apple II it really is), so rebuild it just by myself was a realistic goal. Mechner published original source code some years ago and it has been remade in other development languages by other hobbyist developers, so I don't expect any legal issues for recreating this game just for learning purposes as far I keep it free and open source.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can find Prince of Unity source code and its development related news at:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/dante-signal31/Prince_of_Unity<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T12:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d5/7d50fac3e8c20f808edcfee61149d12f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dante.signal31"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
