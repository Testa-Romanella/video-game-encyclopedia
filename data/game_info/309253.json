Most players either lose interest because it is too easy or feel frustrated because it is too difficult to solve.  <br/><br/>Are you looking for a puzzle game that anyone can play, but still offers plenty to master? Look no further than Kanoodle, it is a fantastic award winning game that has received a huge amount of attention around the world.  Kanoodle is the result of many years of research and development to create a fun, enjoyable and challenging brain exercise game for all ages.  <br/><br/>Beware, Kanoodle is a very addictive game, so it\u2019s the perfect game to return to again and again.
