It's very silly and stream-of-conscious as you can probably tell!</p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 hours for TriJam 50, where the theme was \"Not the game you think it was\". This game also fulfills the bonus challenges of mouse-only controls (not hard for a VN) and having known movie/game\u00a0Easter eggs!</p>\n<p>This was also made in the time-frame of Weekly Game Jam 128, whose theme was \"Camouflage\". This theme also applies to this game in one of the story paths, but I won't spoil how...</p>\r\nASSETS\r\n<p>This game was made in RenPy! All scripting and code was done by me in the three hours!
