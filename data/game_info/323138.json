False priorities can act like blinders and make us overlook the ever-present beauty of the universe, which can be our greatest source of energy and inspiration. A positive and grateful mindset enables us to harvest that energy to fuel our inner space and retain well-being. With this virtual-reality experience I express my own appreciation for and feelings about the gift of life. We need keep our ability to see the world through the wondering eyes of a child. <br/>It is a journey within that hopefully will touch you on an emotional level and make you transcend into a relaxed and appreciative state of mind.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31a7b8e852eab7a1ab6cc13fbec9fe71.jpg", "website": "http://epicscapes.de/conscious-existence-virtual-reality.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 45, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marc Zimmermann"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["EpicScapes"], "esrb_rating": null}
