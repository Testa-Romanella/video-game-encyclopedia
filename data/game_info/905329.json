In order to escape, he will have to leave each of the rooms of this gloomy building, picking up all the stars and keys present, which will open the exit door.</p>\n<p>But be careful, Mabool is spherical in shape, and once launched, it can only stop if it encounters an obstacle (wall, star or another object...).
