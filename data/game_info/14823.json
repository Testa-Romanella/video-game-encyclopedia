{"id": 14823, "slug": "tiamat-x", "name": "Tiamat X", "name_original": "Tiamat X", "description": "The evil Choazid Empire has launched a surprise attack on your homeworld, establishing a heavily fortified base from where their forward assault group burrows deep underground, capturing subterranean lifeforms and transforming them into vicious biomechs. <br/><br/>With it being only a matter of time before the Choazids start converting your people, it's up to you to take the controls of one of the few remaining Tiamat dragonship prototypes: the X class fighter, a craft capable of immense firepower - provided you pick up enough upgrade caches during a mission where you must dodge and blast like there's no tomorrow. <br/><br/>Featuring six levels of intense shooting action, Tiamat X is a rip-snortin tribute to the side-scrolling shooters of yesteryear, and would be right at home blazing away on the screen of a booming, beer-stained arcade cabinet. As such, your PC will have to do, and it is much to the designer's regret that he can't plumb a coin-slot into his rig for that truly authentic seaside amusement-park experience.<br/> <br/>Get some big speakers, though. Really, we do recommend them for this game. <br/><br/>Key features include: <br/><ul><li>Auto fire - this is primarily intended as an accessibility option and allows the player to not have to worry about using a fire button. <br/></li><li>Quick fire - don't like mashing buttons/keys, then this is for you. Press and hold to fire. <br/></li><li>Color blind filter - this filter adjusts the game thereby making it more colour blind friendly. We just hope we have got it right! <br/></li><li>Six levels of intense shooting action. <br/></li><li>Original music score.<br/></li><li>Steam Achievements.<br/></li><li>Steam Leaderboards.<br/></li><li>Steam Trading Cards - featuring artwork designed exclusively for these cards!.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T12:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/5713401d519b601f280a34b1725a39cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 118, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 598, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BBQ Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BBQ Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
