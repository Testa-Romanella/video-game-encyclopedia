He's no control and he's suffering. Somebody helps him and supplies him different suits. </p>\n<p>The Suit of Mr. Snake is the final project of BAU Game Design Graduate Program aka Master BUG's Game Design Studio class. Made with PuzzleScript, in 6 hours. It's a 2D puzzle game with tile based movement.</p>\n<p>The final project's theme was \"superhero\" and we need to choose a brand. I chose a condom brand, called Okey, and the superhero is Mr. Snake. This game could be used as a viral ad introducing different condom types, using metaphors. Three different types of condoms are subjected in the game; regular, textured and ultra thin. </p>\n<p>You can hack the game from here.</p>\n<p>Soundtrack is available on Spotify.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c27/c27cc2cd402af8db83ed758c38f0b11e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Efe Ala\u00e7aml\u0131"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
