Every itch.io purchase comes with a Steam key.<br/><br/>An indie platform game about keys, running, jumping, doors and nonsense.</p>\n<p>Another Perspective follows the adventure of someone who is looking for something that they can't remember. Then they work out they can warp themselves into other bodies and things get a bit confusing.</p>\n<p>Check out the official launch page and trailers!</p>\n<p>http://shaunspalding.co.uk/AnotherPerspective/ </p>\n<p>Any technical issues with the game please do contact me at shaun.spalding@gmail.com and I will do my best to help out. I recommend if you don't have a fairly modern machine to run the game <em>without</em> lighting enabled. It's a big performance killer and the game should still look great without it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec74e48964829cff56483c233d15484f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaunJS"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
