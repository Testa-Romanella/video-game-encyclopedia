You get to choose a class and go on frightening adventures battling your nemesis - the Dogs - who unburied you from the depths below.</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll be faced with various quests, meet friendly skeletons, travel to spine-tingling dungeons and fight monsters to get stronger. The entire world has class-specific quests and several randomized elements that will change as you visit them again. But beware - as a sinister skeleton wandering about, not everyone will accept you. The dead aren&#39;t as welcome as they should and it&#39;s not even halloween yet.<br />\nFeatures:<br />\nSingle character, multiple classes, items, abilities and spells.<br />\nRandomized loot affixes which change your skills when equipped.<br />\nMultiple Endings.<br />\nBarebones battle system.<br />\nHeartless story.<br />\nBraindead hard difficulty.<br />\nMOONANA MESSAGE:<br />\nHello, everyone, this is Nana, lead developer at Moonana. We are the developers of Virgo Versus The Zodiac and Keylocker | Cyberpunk Turn Based Action! I just wanted to let you all know that this is not a game developed by the whole team at Moonana, it&#39;s developed by our animator, Anglerman and I helped a bit here and there with dialogues and guidance. This game is being published by Moonana as means of assistance to Anglerman, since he despises the bureaucracy behind launching a game, but I deeply endorse his work and wanted everyone to know about it! I hope you guys will enjoy his work as well and cheer for Anglerman&#39;s barely alive new game!<br />\nSOUNDTRACK BY: ELEKTROBEAR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T02:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/774/774e00ad76a63c33a6609e4c657f2c8c.jpg", "website": "https://moonanagames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 31, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moonana"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moonana"], "esrb_rating": null}
