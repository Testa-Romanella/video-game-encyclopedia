It\u2019s a full 3D, physics enabled, beautiful simulation that you can enjoy whenever you want with whomever you want. Store your progress on any puzzle and resume at your convenience. Invite friends and loved ones for great multi-player experience or enjoy a solo relaxed session just for you. Keep track of your and your friends' accomplishments, customize your playroom, enter into contests, and do so much more. Our incredible game aims to give you as much flexibility and entertainment as possible.<br/><br/>Now, let\u2019s delve deeper into the main features of Masters of Puzzle and see what makes it a special and different game.Complete 3D SimulationForget about flat, boring, 2-dimensional puzzle building. It\u2019s so last century. Instead, let us introduce you to the pleasure of building realistic jigsaw puzzles in a fully simulated, beautiful environment with active physics. Interact with surfaces, items, and the puzzle tiles themselves as if you\u2019re standing in front of (or above) your real-world puzzle table. Use the same approach and habits you\u2019ve always used before \u2013 but in a purely virtual scene instead.Procedurally Generated PuzzlesAll of our puzzles are generated procedurally based on a huge number of settings \u2013 some of these even adjustable by yourself in the game options. Each puzzle box can be sliced and distributed into one of the available box sizes at the start of each individual game. Furthermore, the form and disposition of the puzzle tiles can be completely changed when you create a new game even if you still use the same image and box size. Replay your favorite puzzles again and again with a fresh challenge every single time.Complexity &amp; Challenge For Every TasteSpeaking of challenge, our current puzzle box sizes include sets of 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, and 4000 tiles. The game aims to provide suitable configuration for every occasion or skill level \u2013 both for beginners and hardcore veterans alike.Play With Friends Or Strangers (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)Single player might be satisfying at times, but building jigsaw puzzles with others is where the real fun begins. We plan to include a fully fledged multiplayer, managed by dedicated virtual servers in the Cloud. Maintain friends lists, chat with others in-game or in the general lobby, create or join multiplayer online games both with people you know or complete strangers by using our matchmaking system. Resume your online game at any time with or without the others being present. Leave messages as sticky notes and discuss strategy even if you\u2019re not all present at the same time.*Customizable Playroom (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)Is realistic simulation not enough for you? Good, because this planned feature will allow you to fully customize your playroom and environment with high-quality materials and custom-crafted vanity objects that you can earn in the game by various means or purchase in our in-game vanity shop, once it's made available. Unwind your imagination and make your playroom as unique as you might want.Listen to Your Own Music (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)Building puzzles in a silent environment might not be fun for everyone. That\u2019s why we plan to provide you with the functionality to play your music of choice while solving your next jigsaw challenge.Expand Your Puzzle Collection (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)The base game comes with a good selection of free puzzles for you to enjoy. At some point though, you might want to try out new or different images. We plan to provide you on a regular basis with new collections of beautiful puzzles in various styles and painted by different artists. This new content in the form of DLC will adhere to the same replayability rules as the base content.And Much More\u2026These are just the main features either available or planned for Masters of Puzzle, but there are also many others that you will find once you start playing. Additionally, we have plans to expand the game with regular updates and new features as we move forward. Contact us and share what else you\u2019d like to see in the game.<br/><br/><br/>* Note: Multiplayer and all online services will require an active Internet connection as well as an active player account in our systems. However, you can still play solo without access to the Internet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19e/19e216e0a785e4ccbbbe61a83f953707.jpg", "website": "http://bit.ly/2EAzJAO", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 329, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Belleal Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Belleal Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
