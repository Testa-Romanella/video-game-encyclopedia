This way you can make very strong, big creatures that only attack the castle and small, weak characters that attack everything on their way as well.<br/>\r\nCharacters look for the nearest enemy and attack it. Otherwise, if the enemy is out of range, they will attack the castle.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsing UI buttons, you can select a unit and deploy it in the battle arena. If you don\u2019t have enough gold to deploy the unit, there\u2019s a warning.
