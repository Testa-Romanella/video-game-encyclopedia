Back then, I didn't manage to finish it\u00a0in time for the jam, so I didn't\u00a0submit it. Some years later I looked into it again and\u00a0decided to poke into it, clean some of the messy code and port it to WebAssembly for fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended with some synthwave music :)</strong></p>\r\nTools Used\r\n<p>The game was programmed in C, using the SDL2 library with the SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf and\u00a0SDL_FontCache\u00a0extensions. The logo and background images were made in Gimp, and the 3D graphics were made in Blender and exported to the .txt files with some scripts.</p>\n<p>Source Code</p>\n<p>The source code of the project is available at\u00a0GitHub, but bear in mind this was made by 2017 me when I started coding in C, so don't judge me too much :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T02:28:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/728/72856283db8688e20229b2f81d17f18e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KellerMartins"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
