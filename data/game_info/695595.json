You can also drag your heart around to get out of tricky situations. Also know that you can pick up multiple remains that are in the same place, so it's worth piling them up if they're near to each other.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T09:01:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8aee9c52cf0b47f5385105ca00224b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jared"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
