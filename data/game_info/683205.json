After another raid on a flea market, I returned with a wonderful loot - an unusual CD that caught my attention with it's unusual cover. The monster, poorly drawn on paper, seemed to come to life for a moment while I was digging through the piles of junk. That's interesting...<br/>\r\nA platformer that promises action, shooting, lots of puzzles and unstoppable fun is a good choice for the night, according to the description. I had hardly ran the console, when the glitch appeared. It's hard to say how many mistakes were made in the game's code, but at some point i found myself inside the game's world!<br/>\r\nDevelopers, it is not funny! Your game is so bugged, it tore the Fabric of the Universe, and i was dragged into the game! Am I supposed to fix bugs for you, so that i can get out of here?! What planet is this messed up game from!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6de2c9871eee9beca56276d31c76f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BearsCom Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BearsCom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
