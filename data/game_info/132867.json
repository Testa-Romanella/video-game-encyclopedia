Throughout the experience, the space around you\u00a0abruptly transforms, in a rhythm meant to give you a sense of freedom even in the most ominous of realities.</p>\n<p>\"I was going a little crazy trying to write music in my studio at home in Sydney. I had writer's block for months, to the point where I thought I may never be able to write music again. So I bought a one-way ticket to Tasmania, found a log cabin in the woods, and isolated myself from the world for 10 days. This is the moment I broke free from my creative block.\" Flume @\u00a0instagram.com/p/BF1MwHqzYuy/</p>\n<p>Spacewave was made in the Summer of 2016,\u00a0in collaboration with\u00a0fraga.space.\u00a0The song is used with knowledge from the good people at Future Classic.
