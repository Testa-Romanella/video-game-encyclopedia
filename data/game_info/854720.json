Or just have fun with clearing the maps and getting all the coins.</p>\n\n<p>Our initial vision included a little witch cleaning her fireplace for winter. We got a little lost in adding all the mechanics to the game, but hope we can bring you a joyful experience.<br/></p>\n<p>We tried to make the game feel homely and cozy, while making all assets ourselves and using only the given palette. The entire game takes place in one room.</p>\n\n<p>The game obviously is inspired by Peggle and Peglin, both very cute games.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Programming: Steffen Schlosser, S\u00fckr\u00fc Turhal\r\n</p>\n<p>Design: Steffen Schlosser, Leonard Sch\u00fc\u00dfler, S\u00fckr\u00fc Turhal\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Leonard Sch\u00fc\u00dfler\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:02:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb512750fac15b90b43e61726dca356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["2Shy2Shine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
