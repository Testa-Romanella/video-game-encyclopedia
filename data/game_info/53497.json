{"id": 53497, "slug": "rhythm-tengoku", "name": "Rhythm Tengoku", "name_original": "Rhythm Tengoku", "description": "<p>Rhythm Tengoku is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. The game has spawned three sequels; Rhythm Heaven, Rhythm Heaven Fever, and Rhythm Heaven Megamix. It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.</p>\n<p>Rhythm Tengoku's gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm (in some rhythm games as a character) until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the WarioWare series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-18T02:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e7a656798744810ae99e792b23ba4f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Nintendo", "J.P.Room Recordings", "Arcade version:"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
