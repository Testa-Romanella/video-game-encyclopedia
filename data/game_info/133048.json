A minimalist RPG created for the Low Res jam 2016.<br/></p><p>Developed from scratch using the Monkey language, which will allow it to run on multiple platforms. I'll post the full source code once there's enough of it.</p><p>Gameplay ideas:</p><p>- Only 4 equipped items at a time. When you find a new item, you have to choose between it and one of the items you're already carrying</p><p>- A bag provides 4 slots for small single use items, and equal items can be stacked. </p><p>-Stats will be very simple, possibly Health, Attack, Defense, Speed and Magic Resistance.</p><p>- Speed will affect how many actions you can take per turn (like Action points in some RPGs)</p><p>- Combat will be turn based</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61a4443df6e8a11e4e9ea5de4b13bf84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ethernaut"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
