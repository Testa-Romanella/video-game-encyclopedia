In this version you need to work for it to feed the snake.</p><p>Initial game was made in 2h together with vanilla snake, but had problems finding way to colorize game like I wanted and that took me 2h. So instead of intended 3h I spent 4+ hours but it was worth it. I hope you'll enjoy challenging snake game.</p>\n<p>Source -\u00a0https://github.com/nezvers/Godot_jam_games_3.1/tree/master/Trijam%20-%20Near%20Miss%20Snake</p>\n<p>Youtube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4-Y0E6mmwjtawcitIAzKQ</p>\n<p>Twitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/NeZversStudio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/1784ad6cd79af1364d6a306c618b4535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nezvers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
