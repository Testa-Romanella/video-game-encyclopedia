{"id": 469269, "slug": "arc-sys-battle-climax", "name": "Arc Sys Battle Climax", "name_original": "Arc Sys Battle Climax", "description": "<p>Hello.</p>\n<p>This is a local Multiplayer only fan game using various assets and characters of Arc System Works Project. Made for the most part during quarantine. (No CPU)</p>\n<p>This is a small project I created during the second year of my university. I am not very good at art so I took various resources from Arc System Works games and mashed together a simple fighter. Hope you like it ^^.</p>\n<p>If enough requests are there I will release the Game Maker Studio 2 Project files for anyone to edit and make their game based upon this. I do not own any of Arc System Works assets this is simply a fan-game and is not supposed to be distributed for money. This fan game and the project files will always remain free for anyone to download.</p>\n<p>Highly recommend using 4 Gamepad's and playing with 4 players. Keyboard Support is also available but not recommended. Download the attached Keyboard Config file for the Keyboard controls as they are not displayed inside the game.</p>\n<p>Hope you all like the game and please support Arc System Works and their properties. They make amazing fighting games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b38a5d86fd8a7bd3e9cefddfea3cb2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigiorPoke"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
