It is accompanied by a single letter which reads:<br />\nTo the able minds of Earth,<br />\nWhat I am is not important; what I do is important. I challenge beings in contests that play to their greatest strength, and now I\u2019ve come for you.</p>\n<p>Put down your wearisome weapons, cast off your boorish bodies, and draw humanity\u2019s sharpest blade: creativity. Wield it against mine, if you dare.<br />\nYou will learn that the difference between fact and fiction is the power to decide which is which. This power I freely grant to you, so that you may pit the mightiest heroes, the most powerful legends, or anything else you can wring from that skull-stuffing you call a brain against me. I await you atop my tower.<br />\nYou may lose as often as you\u2019ll tolerate. But worry not, I threaten no violence; however when I win \u2013 and I will win \u2013 your creativity shall be my trophy. Without it, humanity is surely doomed to a dim end. But no pressure\u2026 after all, it\u2019s just a game.<br />\n-   The Wizard<br />\nAdditional Information<br />\nDungeon Master Mode: Try on The Wizard\u2019s hat, and take control of the dungeon.<br />\nFlexible Party Size: The dungeon can be challenged with 1 to 5 characters at a time.<br />\nSandbox Mode: Choose from a myriad of options to create unique dungeon crawling experiences.<br />\nAdditional Tile Sets: Go beyond the dungeon; explore Star Ships, Haunted Houses, Japanese Villages and Castles, Steampunk Airships, Post-Apocalyptic landscapes, and more...<br />\nAccessible Game Play: Very easy to play, deviously hard to master. Designed to be played with a single finger.<br />\nInteractable Props: From Treasure Chests to Vendi-Machines, discover props and secrets that will help shape the course of your crawl.<br />\nCreation Systems: Not just a modding tool; Popup turns game design into a game. In addition to integrated systems that let you automatically turn your 2D pictures into 3D cutouts, clip and fade sound directly from your videos, and position your favorite pictures on ability cards, everything you create is balanced and incorporated by the AI behind the scenes.<br />\nCurrent State of Development<br />\nThe game is in closed Pre-Alpha. The gameplay is working and all of the characters, enemies, equipment, and abilities have been made using the same tools that will be offered to players, though their interfaces are temporary. Our current goal is to develop the remaining elements of a dungeon run such as persistent gains and interactable props before tackling the creation UIs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-20T08:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a835c5981e7a4541f755a818e44191.jpg", "website": "http://www.popupdungeon.com/", "rating": 2.57, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 995, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 65, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 477, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Triple-B-Titles"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Humble Bundle"], "esrb_rating": null}
