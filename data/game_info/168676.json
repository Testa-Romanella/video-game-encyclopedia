The 'breakable object' IS YOU (well, your spaceship).</p>\n<ul><li>You are the green circle.</li><li>Asteroids are red circles. When they are off-screen and coming towards you, there are yellow warning vectors. When they are off-screen and not coming towards you, they have little grey boxes showing which direction they're in.</li><li>There are targets to reach, the quicker you reach each target, the better your score! Follow the light blue dashed line to reach the next target.</li><li>When you hit an asteroid, the velocity of the impact and size of the asteroid determine how much damage you take. When you run out of health, game over!</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfbeec8cf6df17bc875ea7c126cf2c54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Guard13007"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
