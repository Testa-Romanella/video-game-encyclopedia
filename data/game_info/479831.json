Smoothing out the collisions, I made some mistakes here and they're still far from perfect even after looking at my old code a bit.</p>\n<p>2. I forgot a small part of projecting shadows (a simple one liner) so I had to go look at my old code for this as well.</p>\n<p>I also used my own mastering preset for the music / sound effects but all melodies and sound effects were created during the jam as well as all graphics.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall, the game turned out better than expected.</p>\n<p>Feel free to leave any feedback!<br/></p>\r\nDescription:\r\n<p>This is a fairly standard old school Doom / Quake style shooter where you play as an agent on a mission to infiltrate the enemy castle.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<p>5 Levels + 1 bonus developer testing level.<br/></p>\n<p>6 Weapons. (one is shared with another)<br/></p>\n<p>5 Enemy types.</p>\n<p>A bunch of different items. (ammo, armor, health, powerups, keys)<br/></p>\n<p>Secrets.</p>\n<p>In-game stats like kills, items, time spent in level.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD = Move.</p>\n<p>Mouse = Look around.</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button = Shoot.</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button = Zoom.<br/></p>\n<p>Space = Jump.</p>\n<p>E = Use.</p>\n<p>C = \"Special Power\".</p>\n<p>1-5 = Change Weapon<br/></p>\n<p>If you get stuck you can enable / disable god mode (invulnerability) by pressing \"Home\".</p>\n<strong>Notes on Linux:<br/></strong>\n<p>The Linux version currently has all shaders disabled so it will not look the same as on windows.</p>\n<p>It also has some mouse movement issues, at least using the touchpad on my laptop.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall the native Linux version is relatively untested (I basically just confirmed it runs), so it may be better to just run the Windows version with Wine or something.</p>\n<p>(not tested but should probably work)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b5117f68a4c75e23fd0922b87d87ff47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Apapappa"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
