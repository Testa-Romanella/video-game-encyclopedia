You explore the menu by ussing the arrow keys O . \"W\" and \"S\". I just took my last proyect and broke it for the jam. (But honestly it wasnt that good before).\u00a0</p>\n<p>And if the intentional bugs are not that much evident. Well ... you need to unlock 2 bugs to get into the \"glitchmode\".\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>* First one is getting stuck on the invisible wall at the left. (this happends when you use duck key and go back at the same time, then you just stop pressing duck key and thats it.)</li><li>* Second one is to broke the fire shoot. By presing left and right at the same time. (this works only if you got the fire power up).</li></ul><p>PS: credits to the author of the song.\u00a0</p><p>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/XTaKeRuX<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d620b04d2999477e353d63cd91b6a5d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucentyr"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
