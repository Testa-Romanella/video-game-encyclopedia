I wanted a place to host the work I've done where it can still be accessed. Some modifications were made to remove some of the social and advertisement elements so it should just be the game by itself currently. <br/><br/>Important note: At the time of developing and publishing this app, it was under the group name of BrokenBear Studios which does not have any affiliation with the current dev team Broken Bear Games. After my having stepped away from gamedev for a good while and their entrance into the industry, I have discontinued any personal use of our prior moniker in order to avoid confusion.\u00a0<br/><br/>Additional thanks to the other team members and Cat Suit Studios for all the help putting this together back in the day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T11:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cb/5cb84290713673bc648a55380f8b040c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StrifeCorps"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
