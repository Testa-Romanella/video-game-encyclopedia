Not very advanced but has most of it's main mechanics implemented, which includes the ability to slice enemy bullets out of the air. Some enemy bullets can't be sliced away,\u00a0but you'll have to find that out on your own ;)</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>Mouse - Aim<br/>Left click - Shoot gun<br/>Right click - Swing sword<br/>ESC - Reset game</p>\n<p>Uses an ammo system for both your gun and sword, after about a second they will start to regenerate. Pick up health packs to get some HP back to keep killin' baddies.</p>\n<p>Every time you click the \"Play\" button the game will randomly put you into 1 of 2 levels with some bad guys in them. There is no progression so once a level is devoid of enemies you can press ESC and play again, maybe you'll get the other level!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9b/a9b7832c1cc007f2edaa4e18362802f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ParadiseLostDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
