Work together with Lumins, who live in light, and Shades, who live in darkness, to bring light to the world. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGuide them to discover and solve puzzles, in which they interact with various kinds of light switches, each other, and even the light and darkness itself. Puzzles start simple but eventually become very complex, as different solutions have effects on the world and other puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLumins and Shades is the kind of puzzle game that does not directly spell out its mechanics, but instead allows the player to experiment and discover them on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game contains around 150 puzzles (depending on how you count them) across 11 areas, and a handful of deeper challenges for those who seek them out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T02:50:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5651852e87c62871d334fbeaa5b3f8.jpg", "website": "https://www.luminsandshades.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheOnlyOne"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TheOnlyOne"], "esrb_rating": null}
