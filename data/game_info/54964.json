The game is based on the eponymous volume 28 of the popular French Asterix comic books and was released in 1987.</p>\n<p>Asterix and the Magic Carpet starts as a graphical adventure game where you can select a character on the screen with a cursor and select what he should say, which then influences how the rest of the game plays out. Occasionally there a Pac-Man-like mini arcade games where Asterix has to defeat legionnaires, wild boars, or other enemies in a maze with the help of Obelix who oscillates back and forth in a fixed section of the maze. So the general approach is to catch an enemy's attention, then run away and hide behind Obelix, who will hopefully defeat the enemy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64e48efe55728f86b3620d6f88452438.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Coktel Vision"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Coktel Vision"], "esrb_rating": null}
