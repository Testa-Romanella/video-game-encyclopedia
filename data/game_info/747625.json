But be careful there is a cooldown.</p>\n<p>In this game, you try to dodge and kill square enemies, but you don't see them, you only see their reflections. You can click space to see all the current enemies, but you can use this only 3 times, but every 5 kills you get another one.</p>\n<p>I hope you like this game and good luck with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f03a8ccc916a8f6d321318a1781e852.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pigeon_Develop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
