So much for the many cut features, sophisticated skater logic or\u00a0checkpoint hitting for example. (Maybe they can return in an update.)\u00a0Behind the scenes is certainly a lot more interesting than the game itself.<br/>I'm a little proud how I did some things, \"getting in the flow\" of OOP. But theres some atrocious spaghetti as well.<br/>The assets were pretty good on the 2D side, bless the guy who decided to upload the icon pack. I'd love to \"rematch\", these assets, but i make something different. Perhaps a personal \"jam\" of sorts :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:20:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/04679a655b727ebd7d2110c8f61b619b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["koon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
