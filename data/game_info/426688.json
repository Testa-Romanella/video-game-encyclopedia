They don't work, well, they kinda do, but my poor wizard doesn't have sleeves so he can't use them. I had a good time getting back into development with this game, and I\u00a0used a new game engine to build this, swapping from Unity last semester to Godot for this project. I look forward to the following weeks of gamedev!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A/Left Arrow: Left</p>\n<p>D/Right Arrow: Right</p>\n<p>W/Up Arrow: Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:29:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EggBoi Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
