Your friends, family and other cohorts have all been killed in the name of vanquishing it. You're the last one alive who can destroy the demonic threat. And all you'll need is your shotgun and your right boot. (Or left, depending on whether you're lookin in a mirror.)<br/></p>\n<p>In Mansion of Doom, your goal is to locate and destroy the Heart of Darkness. It's locked away in one of the mansion's many rooms, snaked together by deadly hallways full of the HoD's stalwart defenders. You'll need to find three specialized keys to break down the door to its lair, which themselves are hidden away behind locked doors of their own.<br/></p>\n<p>Explore the mansion. Kick down its doors. Find a way into the Heart's domain. Kill any demon that tries to stop you. And don't stop until it's done.</p>\n<p><strong>== --- ==<br/></strong></p><p><strong>A quick note about donations: This is a jam game!
