You can make money from these trees. You use the money to buy more seeds for more trees! See how much money you can make and how big of a forest you can build!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game had been made to promote our campaign, Forestation Nation. Our focus is to stop deforestation by stopping cutting down trees, then undoing our mistakes by planting the trees back.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This campaign had been made for a school project, and this game is just meant to help with the promotion. If you donate to this game, I'll probably just keep it XD.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T05:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67879e900ff20f33e2e85cc88ce9688.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Forestation Nation"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
