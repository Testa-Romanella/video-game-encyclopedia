Just jump through the red circles, and don't hit touch them.<br/><br/>Your gravity will turn upwards, so you will have to jump through the hoops upside-down, of course, without colliding with the orange circles. <br/><br/>You will see triangles while jumping, but don't worry, you're OK.<br/><br/>Play #Reflective when:<br/><br/>\u25c9 You're in for a wild time with your phone!!!<br/><br/>\u25c9 You need a fast paced one tough game<br/><br/>\u25c9 Your girlfriend/boyfriend left you... again!
