Equal parts entertainment and learning, this is the ultimate test of<br/>\r\nyour real-world seduction skills.<br/>\r\nYour palms are sweaty, your mind goes blank, you struggle to find the right<br/>\r\nthing to say. This beautiful lady is looking at you expectantly and\u2026you<br/>\r\nmake your excuses and leave.<br/>\r\nWe\u2019ve all been in embarrassing dating situations.<br/>\r\nNow you can put yourself in those same situations and experiment until you<br/>\r\nfind the perfect approach for every scenario. The virtual slaps won\u2019t hurt or<br/>\r\nembarrass you, but instead show you what not to do next time. When you<br/>\r\nget a number, a kiss or take a girl home in Super Seducer, the same moves<br/>\r\nwill work in real life.<br/>\r\nWith ten varied levels, over 530 choices, and over 8 hours of high quality<br/>\r\nvideo, the game is rich and varied and we believe it is the biggest FMV<br/>\r\ngame ever made.<br/>\r\nMultiple endings to each level incentivize you to go back again and see if<br/>\r\nyou can do better. If you want to be totally ridiculous, we have you covered<br/>\r\ntoo, the most indecent proposals and ludicrous lines are right there as<br/>\r\nchoices.<br/>\r\nOn level completion, you get feedback for every choice you made, so that<br/>\r\nyou can see exactly why it was right or wrong.<br/>\r\nSo what are you waiting for? These lovely ladies are not going to seduce<br/>\r\nthemselves!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T10:30:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b74973faf43dd2bbc7664fa969282cf.jpg", "website": "https://www.puatraining.com/superseducer", "rating": 3.15, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 18, "owned": 170, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 12, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RLR Training"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["RLR Training"], "esrb_rating": null}
