The man doesn't know how to deal with anything that goes his way, and to find any fulfillment and change in his life he decides and finds a way to take 3 lives, while also joining them as the 4th one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As horrible as that sounds, Noah discovers it is not that easy to take innocent lives, because his main obstacle is his own heart and conscience.
