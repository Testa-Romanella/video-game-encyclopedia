Some enemies will drop a die block that the player can collect. Once the player collects three dice, they're taken to a screen in which they can invest these dice into upgrades. The dice are first rolled and can then be dragged towards an upgrade of the player's choosing. Try to survive as long as possible as more and stronger enemies keep appearing.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Space - Accelerate</p>\n<p>Mouse -\u00a0Aim &amp; dragging dice</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button -\u00a0Shoot</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Dobbermann2</p>\n<p>Drepple</p>\n<p>Buse_CnC</p>\n<p>Charlie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T17:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67f/67f99f8c7ac5cdc73f7b66898e6a741b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dobbermann2", "Drepple", "CheesyCharlie", "Buse_cnc"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
