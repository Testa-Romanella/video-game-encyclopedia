The Evil Double Popsicle Monster has had issues ever since his parents split, now it feels as though all eyes are on him. This is an Android game, about first tapping the left or right side of the screen to dodge the eyeballs falling to the ground. If you dodge 100 the boss stage starts...with lasers. Hopefully you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:50:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eda/eda10a99ef18291146bd4f976adec4d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Soylentwill"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
