The game is simple and easy to pick up and play. This is my first ever complete game so unfortunately there is no menu, or start screen, and no death screen... or score counter lol.\u00a0I would like to implement those features but I have no Idea what i'm doing here... Anyways the game should keep you entertained for like 5 minutes so have fun!</p><p>A mix of poor taste in color, lack of style, and tolerable\u00a0game play!</p><p>Just kidding its pretty fun to play with for a bit of fun.</p>\n\n<p>Player 1 (The purple one)\u00a0 move with WASD.</p>\n<p>Player 2 (The orange one) move with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>You can rest the game with the R key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7596e74466024470f945e0141309b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jerry474"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
