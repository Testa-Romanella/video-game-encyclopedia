We are about to enter a turbulence zone and just in case you are worried, we will not crash. There is not the slightest possibility of our airplane crashing into a pipe in the middle of the sky. Not at all. By the way, are there any pilots on this flight?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>This is a 3D side-scroller that mimics a plane in a turbulence zone, through the eyes of a person who is scared of planes. It uses flappy bird - like endless world generation and is controlled with just the mouse. This is *not* a flappy bird clone. Clicking the left-mouse button makes the plane go up and clicking it again makes it change direction and shoot down. While going up, the plane is slowed down so that you can time your click and while going down, your plane flies at full speed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dde497963596e4d2161ae8e27e17b50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Asado"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
