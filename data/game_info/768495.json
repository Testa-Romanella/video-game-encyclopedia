When you lose time is rewound and you can choose upgrades to make it easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left and Right arrow keys to rotate turret</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ctrl to shoot</strong></p>\n<p>The vague inspiration\u00a0\u00a0for this game was a 90's? MS-DOS game where you shoot anti-missiles to blow up incoming missiles.
