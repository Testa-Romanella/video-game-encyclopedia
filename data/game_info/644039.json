Various Ideas came into mind, like the tokens were buildings that one had to \"Pile up\" to build something or well many ideas.<br/>Finally I settled with the concept of elements fighting each other in some way. Through some mental iterations, I arrived to the final concept of a duel of runes, where each player would choose an element, either fire or ice, and play with tokens of that element.<br/>This gave me more ideas into how to design the UI, music, animations and particle effects. I took some assets I had bought or downloaded, I created and edited them and I started pouring them into the game.<br/>The end result is this. A retro looking pixel art game, about magical runes.<br/>The biggest challenge, as always, was not the complexity of the task, but my own drive to make my best job possible. I never deliver half completed games.<br/>A game must begin and end. The player must have a goal to complete and a way to complete it.<br/>I also added options to customize the board size and how many tokens are needed to connect to win. This allows for some replayability in this simple game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T06:24:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df726be52a81fabc3ec871dcca8c41ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RumbleRoar Studios - Francisco Colarich"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
