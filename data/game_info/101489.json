Master advanced techniques like the Drift Drive that lets you dodge bullets in a split second or even flip into Reverse Drive to hit enemies when they least expect it.\u00a0<br/><br/>Fight through a richly detailed sci-fi adventure and unfold the secrets of the Dimension Drives, then climb the global leader-boards in four different difficulty modes ranging from Normal for a balanced challenge to Insane for whoever can take the pain.
