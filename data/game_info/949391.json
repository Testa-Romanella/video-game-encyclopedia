I designed and implemented advanced AI path-following algorithms, which included basic save and load functionality, seamless animation transitions, and smooth third-person camera movements. One of the unique features of the game is the \"danger zone\" mechanic, which I coded entirely in shader language for improved performance and graphical fidelity. By utilizing my proficiency in both C# and shader programming, I was able to create a proof-of-concept that highlights my technical abilities and attention to detail.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/4871ed120e4980acb85498226627bca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chakki2209"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
