Time is running out... Good luck.</p>\n<p>---------</p>\n<p>My personal record for the game is <strong>Infection Level 6</strong>. What's yours?<br/></p>\r\n\r\nControls :\r\n<p>Use the <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> and <strong>SPACE BAR</strong> to shoot ! And set the <strong>sound on</strong> :)</p>\r\nRemarks :\r\n<ul><li>As a <strong>dungeon</strong> theme, I tried to mimic games I loved like <strong>Doom</strong> or <strong>Might &amp; Magic</strong> in a kind of old FPS rendering.</li><li>The limitations \"helped\" me to find the idea of being in a human body as a <strong>white globule and fighting infections</strong>.</li><li>I spent hours on create an <strong>automatic</strong>\u00a0<strong>generated dungeon</strong>. It was fun ! I can set number of rooms, size of rooms, and put doors on any wall of the room.</li><li>I had so much difficulties trying to allow gamer to <strong>shoot with the mouse cursor</strong>. I really failed and passed too much time on it... The fire action is now very simple.</li><li>I improved a little bit in <strong>graphics</strong> using Piskel for making animated gif of life constants in the game. But, It's still my weakness. As you can see, 3D objects are just basic shapes :(</li><li>Music and sound effect are free to use\u00a0from the <strong>Youtube library</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Anyway, I had a really good time making this game. It was sooooooo cool !</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a940b9b3ad2630cb002726e825ee0dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Damneo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
