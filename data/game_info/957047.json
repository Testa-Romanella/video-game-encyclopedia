As it fitted around the Easter vacation, I was barely able to start the game and will be working on the game further after submission. You will only be able to walk around and explore the forest currently.</p>\n<p>The idea of this\u00a0mini-game will allow you to travel in time to restore your timeline.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Set in the year 2099 at the turn of the New Year celebrations, you take on the role of a time traveller with issues with your ability to time jump. Realising your own wife has no recollection of who you are, your adventure will see you aim to fix your own timeline to get back to the celebrations of the year 3000.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T18:05:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a33b9213ffbcc8739fcea075284770d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waken Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
