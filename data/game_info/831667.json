{"id": 831667, "slug": "i-was-cursed-to-be-a-slime", "name": "I was Cursed to be a Slime!", "name_original": "I was Cursed to be a Slime!", "description": "<p>While taking a leisurely stroll on his day off, a hero finds a slime! However, it turns out it's not actually slime, but an individual cursed to be one after entering an evil spirit's cave. There is no way our noble hero could ever abandon a person in need, even on his day off, so the pair join forces to take out the evil spirit and return the slime to it's true form.</p>\n<p>This is a short turn-based RPG made for OpenGameArt Spring Jam for the theme slime. It was made in Wolf RPG Editor. There are a couple things I want to tweak after the jam, mainly being to get the attack boxes to quit hiding the enemy sprite's stats and\u00a0making the battles more challenging without being too challenging, since that can be worse than too easy.</p><p>Credits: (Anything not mentioned was a default Wolf Asset)</p><p>Art:</p>\n<p>Slime Snail</p>\n<p>Author: Reemax (Tuomo Untinen)</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/slime-snail</p>\n<p>Slime</p>\n<p>Author: Madjestiko</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/slime-2</p>\n<p>Raven pixelart</p>\n<p>Uploaded by Twinartsy</p>\n<p>https://www.kindpng.com/imgv/hwRTTii_silhouette-png-download-raven-pixel-art-tra...</p>\n<p>Swamp background</p>\n<p>Author: CraftPix.net 2D Game Assets</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/swamp-2d-tileset-pixel-art</p>\n<p>[LPC] All Seasons Apple Tree</p>\n<p>Author: ElizaWy</p>\n\n<p>Tree trunk by Johann C.
