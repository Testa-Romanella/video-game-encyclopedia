She was a tomboy, nothing could stop her. The house was built near a small forest so in any emergency situation they could hide in the forest. One day when she was wandering in the forest, she heard a man crying for help. Brave Jane ran for help. Then she found a broken house near the withered trees. She was told never to go near the area by her parents. But Brave Jane went inside without hesitation. When the voice was following, the crying slowly turned into a crooked laugh and all the doors and windows were shut at once. Then a small white light appeared. \"SAVE US,\" said the white light. Jane was very scared and confused at the same time. She asked the light \"who're you\" . Then few other souls appeared. (The intro conversation). Jane was really sad when she heard the story.(The evil spirit doesn't let WW2 dead soldiers' souls to be free, to free the soul Jane must fight the evil spirit). Jane asks the souls who have to do to help.(Souls explaining the mission). Mission continues and Jane finds and makes weapons to defeat evil spirit's minions. Then she defeats the evil spirit and heals the evil spirit (she gets the skill: holy cleanse or something like that) and frees the evil spirit(who was cleansed) along with the other souls and the game is over.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Team Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Miwata, Tomoya - Programmer, team leader\r\n</li><li>Ha Nhat\u00a0 A - Level design, graphic assets and audio assets\r\n</li><li>Pena Burgos Sebastian - graphic assets\r\n</li><li>Chamod Ranadeera - Script and audio assets\r\n</li><li>Farid Umar A - Audio assets and graphic assets\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T09:53:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/176e873c3049b29fb46350e511be1b2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miwa maroon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
