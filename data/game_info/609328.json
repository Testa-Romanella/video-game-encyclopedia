Watch as OPZ grows bigger and better over time.</p>\n<p>So what is Operation Zombie Killerz ?</p>\n<p>Well its a FPS zombie survival game but with a twist. You are a state of the art prototype robot with only one goal... Destroy Zombies On Sight. Survive endless hordes of zombies as you get better gear and items.</p>\n<p>As you slay the dead they may drop you a <strong>\"Cache\". </strong>These come in three rarity's <strong>Rare,Legendary</strong> And <strong>Mythic.</strong> <strong>Rare</strong> weapons have only <strong>1 weapon perk</strong> for e.g: Increased fire rate.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Legendary</strong> weapons have <strong>2 weapon perks </strong>and have increased damage &amp; ammo reserves than there rare versions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mythic weapons </strong>are totally unique. They have their own <strong>custom perks and looks</strong>. For e.g: Celeste: A mythic rocket launcher that shoots a volley of stars that supernova on impact decimating anything in their path !\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now lets talk about\u00a0<strong>Blessings:</strong></p>\n<p>There are currently <strong>3 Blessings</strong> in the game. <strong>\"Valor\"</strong> increases melee damage by <strong>300%</strong>.<strong> \"Windfall\" </strong>increases sprint speed by <strong>20%</strong> and finally <strong>\"Strength\"</strong> Increases equip limit from <strong>2 to 4.</strong></p>\n<p>Now the juicy stuff... <strong>Weapons:</strong></p>\n<p>Currently there are around <strong>18-20 Weapons</strong> which each have at least<strong> 5 rare variants</strong> and at least <strong>4 legendary variants per weapon.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Easter Eggs:</strong> As of version 0.1 there is only 1 easter egg in the game which is a<strong> music easter egg</strong> hidden in the first map <strong>\"God Complex\"</strong> can you find it ?</p>\n<p>Lastly i just want to thank you for even considering trying my little game. Its far from prefect and im still learning so much. But i thought it would be cool to upload it here and let you see how the game evolves as i grow as a developer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, and go slay some zombies !</p>\n<p>- Shaun</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T07:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80be7eaefe7a9fb4fbc444301faee39a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shaun246"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
