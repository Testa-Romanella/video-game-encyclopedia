Each one of the island is unique, featuring different atmospheres, creatures, monsters and loot.<br/>But\u00a0what makes Ozone unique against other games based on the same style is that, in order to survive, you have to gather food and water. With this, entertainment is always granted. You will never find a boring situation where you cannot find an enemy player, because there will always be monsters with AI hunting you down, or your own thirst and hunger trying to alert you to find something to survive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T05:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299d316f41af541b7bcc89c3a842c473.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SouzaCarlos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
