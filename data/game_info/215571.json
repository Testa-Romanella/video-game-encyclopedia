In this rock-paper-scissors style format, the stats dictate which ship survives! <br/>The triangle works as follows!<br/>Attack &gt; Speed<br/>Defense &gt; Attack<br/>Speed &gt; Defense</p>\n<p>For example:<br/>1 Speed subtracts 1 Defense from the enemy ship!<br/>If any stat reaches 0, that ship is destroyed!</p>\n<p>Pay attention to the stats of the cards being thrown at you! You'll need to decide whether you want to sabotage the card, or overwhelm it with a superior build! Lets get started!</p>\n<p>Player 1 Controls:<br/>Select \u25b2 = W<br/>Select \u25bc = S<br/>Confirm = D<br/>Launch Early = A</p>\n<p>Player 2 Controls:<br/>Select \u25b2 = Up Arrow \u2191<br/>Select \u25bc = Down Arrow \u2193<br/>Confirm = Left Arrow \u2190<br/>Launch Early = Right Arrow \u2192</p>\n<p>Each round, cards will be upgraded (Spread across multiple cards for the winner, with a more powerful booster for the runner up!)</p>\n<p>Good luck!
