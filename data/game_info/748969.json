If you learn to play it properly, you can make all sorts of islands. Cliffy, grassy, scattered, clustered, spikey, you name it. You have three sliders at your disposal, as well as a pause button. Experiment with the order in which you use and change these, as the way you grow your islands will change drastically.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a15d0d0224bebaa0e0f1a0feb4344285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dentstudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
