For some time now, I'm tinkering on big ideas. Yesterday, I took the most common advice for aspiring gamedevs to heart and decided to make something quick and dirty and release.</p>\n<p>So this was my first solo game jam. Done in 24h, though experienced creators should be able to do this in 1 or 2 hours easily.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>Blocks spawn on the right and fly towards you (the block on the left). Blocks match if they match in color and with the dongle. You can change your dongle with the <left>, <right> keys and change color with <up> and <down>.</down></up></right></left></p>\n<p>Every 5 blocks, the speed increases and a new color is added (up to 5 colors). Good luck!</p>\n<p>Please write your high-score in the comments. I usually fail around 20 blocks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T02:59:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e2b4f78704f4bc4e1f0d251255fac8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Polylog"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
