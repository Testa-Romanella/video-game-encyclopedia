Uncommon letters tend to be stronger, but each monster is useful in different scenarios. The length of the word determines the monster's HP and attack power.<h3>Cast spells to manipulate your letter tiles or change the battlefield</h3><br/><br/><br/>Learn a variety of spells during runs that can be cast during battle to help you find the tiles you need, spell the longest words available, or change the battlefield's terrain to give your monsters an advantage.<h3>Upgrade your tiles with enchantments and affinities</h3><br/>After each battle, choose from various rewards that power up your tiles. Letter affinities mean you'll always have a letter in your pool, and tile enchantments give a variety of powers to your monsters. Choose carefully how to upgrade--you'll need to choose rewards that counter your upcoming enemies and synergize well together.<h3>26 Starting Classes</h3><br/>Unlock a variety of starting classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.<h3>Randomized runs keep things fresh</h3><br/>Randomized enemies, terrain, upgrades, and final boss battle give each run its own flavor.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T07:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37aa8d66aa6957b4697676558e74a821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Coffman"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Ben Coffman"], "esrb_rating": null}
