The family gathers at their bedroom window as they eye the empty streets outside to find the source of the commotion. The street is slick with mildew, and nothing is moving. As they are about to give up and head back to bed the doors to the apartment building across the streets slam open. A woman, terrified, exhausted exits the two massive front doors and collapses in the middle of the concrete path. The family, startled, draws their drapes shut and calls the police.</em></p>\n<p><em>The affair is handled quietly. The authorities say it was a domestic affair, nothing more. The land- lord shortly evacuates all tenants living on the third floor and has reportedly bared shut apartment number 3906.
