Some lies are trivial; others have a lasting impact. When shadows and lies come together, lives can be destroyed.<br/><br/>What starts out as a search for two sisters who have gone missing turns into a life-changing journey where you cannot be sure whose side anyone is on, or even why things are happening. Who is the enemy? Who can you believe? How do you know who you are when shadows from the past have so much influence on how you see yourself?<br/><br/>Join Eldan and Dathan as they set off on a tricky mission which immediately hits disaster. Threats build up around them from the ominous Zerrlan sect, causing others to join them in order to stay safe themselves. Can you find help on your way from the many monasteries of the Virtran monks scattered all over the world? And more importantly, can they help you find Dathan's vanished sisters?Features<br/><strong>General</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>    Up to five characters in the active party to add strategic depth<br/></li><li>    12 side quests<br/></li><li>    27 secret rooms to discover<br/></li><li>    Discover 'skill orbs' to increase the power of your skills<br/></li><li>    15 hours approx. gameplay</li></ul><br/><strong>Customize your game to suit your preferences</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>    Choose your difficulty level: Easy, Normal, Hard, Legendary<br/></li><li>    Choose a class for 2 of your characters.
