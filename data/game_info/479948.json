IT DOESN'T MATTER.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>PLAYING</strong><br/></p>\n<p>once you start the game, you will see boxes with numbers. these are the parameters you modify for the level generation. parameters include. X axis, Y axis, Z axis, minimum scale size, maximum scale size, and number of blocks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>below the boxes are some stats. these are the number of gems you collected in the current session [yes, it resets once you exit the game. i apologize :(], the density [a relation of number of blocks and the 3 axes. generally speaking, the smaller the number, the more\u00a0difficult the level gets], and the number of gems to collect [this is based on density].</p>\n<p>there are two dropdown menus on the right. the top one to switch the game mode and the bottom one to switch the music tracks.</p>\n<p>this game uses standard first person controls; WASD for movement and space to jump. you can strafe towards the wall and keep jumping up to 3 times to do a wallrun/walljump. you also have a jump stored at all times to be used once. this means, besides using jump as you would expect, you can fall off of a ledge and press space to jump in midair.</p>\n<p>gem collecting is simple: collect the gems as fast as possible. failure can happen by falling off the level or experiencing an impossible gem that cannot be collected. while your time will not be logged, your collected gems will.</p>\n<p>there are two race types: standard and vertical. standard is along the Z axis, so make sure you max out the Z axis on race mode. likewise, max out the Y axis for the vertical race.</p>\n<p>press escape to pause the game and if you want to go back to the generation menu.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>almost everything is done by me. music, programming, concept, sound, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>special thanks, however, goes to brackeys for his unity tutorials and dani for his game karlson and a source of\u00a0motivation. if a bozo milk drinker can make a game, so can i.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64ab9fdee669d84a33d712acbcfc0a00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JohannKrupps"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
