This time I tried to take advantage of the movement with the level design (its not that good though).</p>\n<p>While this definitely isn't my best work, I think its quite fun to zip through the level! (I didn't include a speed-run timer for two reasons: laziness, and while the course is made for speed, it doesn't actually have much speed-run potential)</p>\n<p>I made this game in the Godot game engine, made the art in\u00a0<em>aseprite</em>, the music with\u00a0Online Sequencer<em>\u00a0</em>(its actually better than the ones I've dowloaded), and the sound effects with\u00a0<em>Audacity</em>, although one of them I took from an old game of mine, and was made with\u00a0<em>Bosca Ceoli</em>. The font came from\u00a0Daniel Linssen - itch.io.
