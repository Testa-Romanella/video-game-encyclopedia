Suddenly an ancient magical artifact starts bringing the exhibits back to life! You see a T REX Skeleton Exhibit and it is controlling the artifact! Only you can stop the TREX and get the ancient power for yourself! You must arm yourself with helpful items and weapons in the museum to stop him!</p>\n<p>Not all assets and game mechanics were able to be completed in time for the Jam, but we did our best!
