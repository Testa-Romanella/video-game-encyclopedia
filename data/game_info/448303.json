It will be made on Unity. Why made? Because I didn't make games before. Yeah, it will be my first game, also first 3d game I ever made. I have tones of motivation. And this project will be finished. Also I never learned C# so it will be TWICE interesting to make this game. Current state: Alpha. Devs:1. Hours of making it a day: idk lol.</p>\n<p>@Piece Crap Studio</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/2Qj7ewk<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T04:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d4fa297200acdcdfbd382b8a8dc803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fl1pNatic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
