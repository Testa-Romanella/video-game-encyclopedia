{"id": 63063, "slug": "whirlygig", "name": "Whirlygig", "name_original": "Whirlygig", "description": "<strong>Whirlygig </strong>is a block building game which consists of 4 unique grids \u2013 Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer.  Blocks move upward in Fall, to the right in Winter, downward in Spring, and to the left in Summer.  Every 5 turns, a new grid is randomly selected as the next grid to play in.<br/><br/><strong>Block Control:</strong>  Blocks can be controlled with keyboard or joystick inputs.  Blocks can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise.  The controls can be updated by the user within the Controls screen.  <br/><br/><strong>Game Levels:</strong>  The beginning level of the game is set by the user when selecting the difficulty.  This dictates the speed of the block fall, the movement of the blocks from side-to-side, and the number of points achieved when destroying rows of blocks or activating a special bomb.  Every 10 rows destroyed increases the level as long as the level is greater than the starting difficulty selected by the user.<br/><br/><strong>Scoring:</strong>  Points are accumulated when 1 to 5 rows of blocks are destroyed, or a bomb is detonated.  The more rows that are destroyed at once or individual pieces blown up, the higher the points earned.  <br/><br/><strong>Game Over: </strong> The game has no timer or restriction on number of levels, lines, or blocks.  The game ends when the block level reaches any of the 4 spawn points.<br/><br/><strong>Whirlygig:</strong>  4 destroyed rows at once is called a Whirlygig.  When this is achieved, a bonus piece is created.  The user has 5 turns to destroy this bonus piece to receive a good block that will be stored within the grid for later use.  If the bonus piece is not cleared, the user receives a bad block immediately.  Up to 3 good blocks can be stored in each grid, but only one can be activated in a given turn.  However, good blocks can be activated one after the other, and their spawning is in addition to the 5 standard turns received in the grid.<br/><br/>Extra Long = The extra long good block is 5 pieces high allowing the user to obtain a higher score by destroying 5 rows at once. <br/>Bomb = The bomb good block destroys any piece to the left, right, top, or bottom of the bomb.  The bomb itself is also destroyed in the process.<br/>Single = The single good block spawns 3 consecutive single blocks for the user.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e5083f31aab560e8a76896919291035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bannerman Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bannerman Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
