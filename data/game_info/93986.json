Slowly he opens his eyes, and notices a light appearing in his room.</p>\n<p>The light is getting brighter, the trembling is getting louder, and suddenly a portal appears right there, in his room!</p>\n<p>Are you brave enough to help Sir Questionnaire\u00a0investigate the portal? Step through the door into a different world? Full of monsters, danger, adventure, and loot!?</p>\n\n\r\nGame\r\n<p>Sir\u00a0Questionnaire is a turn-based hack'n'slash game, where you enter a dungeon and each room gives you two options: leave the room, or interact with what ever is in the room. This can be monsters, but also debris, treasure chests, pools of water, or just another door!</p>\n\n<p>Take pictures of your various encounters and complete your codex with information on the various entities that roam the dungeon.</p>\n<p>Take on Quests as you enter every game, ranging from easy to hard, with each quest type giving you a reward for your next game. The harder the quest, the bigger the reward, so choose wisely!</p>\n\n\r\nSteam!?\r\n<p>For now the game is not available on Steam, just on Itch. Why? Because I'm not sure this game is suited for Steam.\u00a0 HOWEVER if you buy the game here on Itch, and the game eventually does hit Steam, you'll get a steam-key for free with your Itch version!</p>\n<p>If you want a Steam version, let me know! If enough people are requesting it, I'll put it up on Steam alongside Itch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad0/ad0cd36adb6fd7e534d3c4f6170db322.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orangepixel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
