The game is also based on a wave system, having 20 waves to complete before the finale. Both main characters seen in the game are sent to save the world from a nuclear invasion, so they have to go through a base of enemies to be able to stop them from firing nukes. The game features a fair and cooperative buying mechanic so when progressing through the game you can be stronger with each wave of enemies.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T10:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120a1e3cf279d208b94a6eaf3edb5c8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SzymonSroka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
