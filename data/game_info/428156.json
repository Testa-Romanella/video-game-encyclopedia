As players acquire more and more deities at their disposal, a good team most well-suited to their play-styles must be formed after a randomly-generated Expedition Deck is dealt to them the beginning of each expedition.<h3>Key Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Innovative Battle System \u2013 You can utilize up to 3 gods/goddesses to form a team with 5 different roles to choose from: Tank, Physical Damage Dealer, Magical Damage Dealer, Healer, and Support.<br/><br/></li><li>Rogue-lite Adventure and Expedition Maps \u2013 An Adventure Map that resets its tiles every lap, a new randomly-generated deck every expedition, with an Expedition Map that also generates new paths every time you embark on a new Expedition!<br/><br/></li><li>Survival of the Fittest- Your team will not be automatically healed after each battle.  Nor will level up restore the team's health.  How far can you push?<br/><br/></li><li>Acquire New Deities \u2013 As the game progresses, new deities will join you on the Adventure Map.  Meet Hermes, Zeus, Anubis, Isis, and more!<br/><br/></li><li>Opportunity Attacks from Monsters \u2013 When you make the characters switch rows, the monsters have a chance to make an opportunity attack on the retreating character.  To switch, or not to switch, that is the question!<br/><br/></li><li>Divine Cards - Another innovative design where the cards will change functions according to the active deity at the front row!<br/><br/></li><li>Movement Abilities \u2013 A never-before-seen feature in a card battle game!  When you move a deity to the front row, he/she will automatically perform a special action.  Some will heal teammates, some will make an extra attack or even AoE attacks, while some will provide beneficial abilities such as drawing an additional card or regain action points.  Pick the right team, and maybe you can come up with that IMBA combo!</li></ul><br/>Note: In addition to Greek and Egyptian myths, we plan to add Chinese, Norse, Hindu, and Japanese myths in future DLCs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You're welcome to join our Discord server to interact with us.<br/>https://discord.gg/eWajgA4", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb4ba11c6ee16499e73a33d72278480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greedy Wolf Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Greedy Wolf Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
