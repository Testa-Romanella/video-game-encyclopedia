{"id": 28460, "slug": "forza-motorsport-4", "name": "Forza Motorsport 4", "name_original": "Forza Motorsport 4", "description": "<p>Forza Motorsport 4 is the fourth game in its series that allows the player to race a variety of 500 cars.</p>\n<h3>Modes</h3>\n<p>The main career mode is called World Tour Mode. It allows the player to race a series of challenges to receive a better car as a reward. 26 locations include famous real-world tracks, such as Hockenheimring and Indianapolis. There&#39;s also a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players</p>\n<h3>Changes from previous games</h3>\n<p>There are several differences between Forza Motorsport 4 and its predecessors. One of the most notable is the automatically adjusted difficulty. The game keeps track of the user&#39;s score and abilities and alters the AI and speed of the rival drivers accordingly. Another new feature is that the player can choose the prize car he or she receives.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a new option called Autovista. In this mode, the player can explore a car in details, both inside and outside of it, including the parts not usually seen. Autovista provides the user with information about certain parts of the car through the voice messages. There are 24 cars that the player can observe in this mode.</p>\n<h3>Controls</h3>\n<p>Being an Xbox 360-only game, Forza Motorsport 4 allows the player to use Kinect as part of the controls. When included, Kinect can control either the vehicle or the player&#39;s vision. In the former mode, the game uses automatic acceleration and deceleration, while the player steers an imaginary wheel. In the latter mode, Kinect tracks the player&#39;s head movements to let the user look left, right, or back.</p>", "metacritic": 91, "released": "2011-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-26T14:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/609/6093bea01151a43078264e33e91bbf83.jpg", "website": "https://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-US/games/fm4", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 724, "beaten": 76, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 82, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 65, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 172, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 173, "platforms": ["Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Turn 10 Studios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
