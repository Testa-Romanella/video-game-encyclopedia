We have spent five years polishing our creation to make sure that your experience with the game will be as memorable as the aforementioned titles and we wholeheartedly believe that you won't be disappointed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fury Unleashed: Prologue</strong> is a standalone demo which contains nearly entire content of the first comic book included in the full game. It should normally take 1-2 hours to complete, and the character progress and unlocks made in the Prologue seamlessly transfer to the full version.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Explore the pages of a living comic book where ink is your most valuable resource and each room is a comic panel. Find out why is John Kowalsky, author of acclaimed Fury Unleashed series having a creativity crisis and see if you can help him deal with it.</p>\n<p>Kill enemies quickly enough to unleash your fury and rip through everything in your way without getting injured. Learn to play flawlessly and beat the entire game in one, epic combo!</p>\n<p>Choose either challenging Hard mode, which will put your skills to the test - or Easy mode, where you can adjust the difficulty parameters to your liking.
