I came late to the jam due to getting my demo of NEMESES out, so this is what I was able to put together. It was originally going to be a horror game, but I couldn't get the planet mechanics working right for a monster, and the project took a completely different direction last minute. A creature was modeled, textured, animated, and placed in the game, but trying to make it follow the player around a moon caused all sorts of erratic behavior. Mostly spinning aimlessly off into space.\u00a0</p><p>The actual story was designed and implemented during the final evening.\u00a0Pardon the terrible voice acting, and my attempt at voicing a female character.\u00a0Hope you like it!</p><p>*UPDATE* I couldn't get a really important piece of the game to work by the deadline, so I added an updated version. It's after the submission cutoff, but to get the full experience of the game, I recommend playing the update. It's mainly one really small, but really important detail. It was in the original version, the timing was just really off.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c2/8c2a246a6c421b2c4cbe16480f511da9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Reeves"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
