The software of choice for expert keyboardists. Once you've installed the software, you'll be paired 1 on 1 with one of our excellent instructors. They'll walk you through the rest.</p>\n<p>Thank you for typing with us!</p>\n\r\nNotes to players:\r\n<p>This game (by nature of its design) requires a keyboard that supports all characters of the English Alphabet. It also expects a QWERTY keyboard layout. If you can at least simulate English characters you'll be able to get by, but the best experience is on QWERTY. I apologize for this!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Triple TriJam which means it was made in a total of 9 non-continuous hours. It also means that shipped with this game is 3 builds, each representing 3 hours of work. The third one is the most \"finished\" so if you just want to play the game, that's the one to play.</p>\n<p>Certain elements of production were NOT tracked in that 9 hour figure.
