Magic dueling in pubic is a common thing here. Those who lose pay not with their lives, but with their honour! One little mistake - and your opponent's precise spell removes an item of your clothing, and when there is nothing else to remove, you can only giggle shamefacedly in front of a students crowd...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Yet, many young witches dream of studying in Catwarts. The diploma of this academy is very appreciated in their profession, and the specialization of Catwarts is soooo nice - everyone likes to train magic cats!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You were also invited to study in \u0421atwarts. Your first duel is coming soon - it's high time to check if your cat army is ready to fight and... put on beautiful clothes. Who knows if you will be able to win this duel", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45cce427de2b399625445041c6cbc2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joystick Knights"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Joystick Knights"], "esrb_rating": null}
