You have to play as a child who get locked since he was a small, in order to be trained into a soul container to feed their evil god.\r\n</p>\n<p>Created by my friends and me for Ludum Dare 48, maybe will develop deeper later.\r\n</p>\n<p>Was intended to make a full-length demo but because some unexpected accident happened to some of our team members, it has to be ended in a unneat way, sorry for that! Within this demo, you have to just escape from the building. No need to reveal the dark secret behind your childhood, nor this whole city. If we are lucky enough, we will make a complete version afterwards.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:39:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/697/69751558978a5f8d097dd25c687fcb46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lighty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
