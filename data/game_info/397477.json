The city is in the throes of an outbreak, with the shuffling undead wandering the streets and the urban jungle becoming a tangle of overturned cars and crumbling buildings. Picturesque, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s against this backdrop that Jill Valentine prepares to make her escape, though there\u2019s a bit of a twist in the timeline for those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with the original. If you played Resident Evil 2 earlier this year, you may know that Leon and Claire arrived in the city on September 29th. Jill\u2019s story, however, starts a few days earlier. As an accomplished member of S.T.A.R.S. and a survivor of the incident in the Arklay Mountains (the site of the original Resident Evil), Jill has some experience with the horrors that await.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T09:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a4b/a4bb55f42fe837ae7bf1307e7b41cc85.jpg", "website": "https://www.residentevil.com/re3", "rating": 4.04, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 308, "owned": 2785, "beaten": 1046, "toplay": 574, "dropped": 83, "playing": 24}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 919, "suggestions_count": 501, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 946, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
