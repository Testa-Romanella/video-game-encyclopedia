{"id": 362111, "slug": "tankroids-wip", "name": "Tankroids (WIP)", "name_original": "Tankroids (WIP)", "description": "<p>This game in its current state was developed in 1 week as part of DSOP's July Game Jam.<br/><br/>This game was built for an arcade cabinet that has 4 sticks and 3 buttons per stick. My intention was to make a competitive game that plays a bit like Atari's Asteroids but with a level a bit closer to Atari's Tank.<br/><br/>I used @Kenney assets for most of the game. A DSOP member donated some sounds (WIP). The metal backgrounds came from\u00a0FreePBR.com.\u00a0 The Hazard strips came from here.</p>\n<p>I am currently developing a dedicated server that will let people connect and just brawl. After that, I\u00a0will likely move on to a different project.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0feel like I\u00a0learned a lot about myself on this project. I proved to myself that I\u00a0can get a project done if I\u00a0set my goals correctly and a really push into it. However, I\u00a0believe this game was designed with some unrealistic constraints (arcade cabinet, game jam time limit, day job) and does not make sense for a long term project. I think I\u00a0can a better game for a more traditional platform.\r\n</p>\n<p>Right now I'm adding networked multiplayer, once again, so that I\u00a0can prove to myself that I\u00a0can do it. Once that is working well enough, I'll abandon the project. (unless for some bizarre reason the project becomes <strong>crazy</strong> popular and I can justify spending full time on it)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:39:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aa893e54d5c41521226f67d091d1d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["greenf0x"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
