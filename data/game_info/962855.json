The world must have looked massive from where you stood, at three feet tall. At that time, you probably thought mysteries lurked behind every corner in the world of adults.<br/><br/>If you could go back in time, to a world of the past where monsters and mysteries existed, would you fix some of the broken things you left behind and alter the course of your fate? <br/><br/><strong>Welcome to Edelton, the twilight town of Rose and ash.</strong><br/><br/><strong>\"Summerset\" is the prologue chapter to the larger \"Garden of Roses\" to come, full of its share of monsters and mystery and an unfinished score to settle.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>You play Will Getz, a hot-headed young man with unfinished business to settle. When you were seven years old you left the town you grew up in during the dead of night, never to return.  Fifteen years later, you return to the quaint town of Edelton at long last to finish things where you left off.<br/><br/>While you're in town you quickly find yourself being drawn to  a harpy named Rosa Oaks, and quickly become tangled in all the suffering that befalls her. The seemingly short trip to dot your i's and cross your t's spirals into something much bigger than yourself where everyone is involved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your discoveries and epiphanies are recorded in the \"Memorandum,\" a journal that expands as you start to remember the town from 15 years ago. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Your choices, both large and small, have ripple effects that aren't immediately obvious. At the end of your journey, you'll have a chance to look back and figure out how things could've gone differently and turn over any stones you might have missed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-30T03:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aab/aab2088d2a63695e0bc27b904e2b9699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Outis Media"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Outis Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
