Your goal as the player is to survive and get out of the labyrinth. This job won't be easy though, as you only have a limited light source and your field of vision is restrained. In Looming Darkness as the title indicates, you're surrounded by darkness that's closing in on you as you play.</p>\n<p>If you like the game feel free to donate as it will be used towards our next game project! :)</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>- Glitching NPCs dev team:</p>\n<p>Daniel M\u00e1r Bonilla</p>\n<p>J\u00f3n Einar J\u00f3hannsson</p>\n<p>Viktor Sveinsson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/715f4575d1b1044df133d108d0fee016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GlitchingNPCs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
