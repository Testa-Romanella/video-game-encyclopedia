Some vfx and sound effects were borrowed from the asset store, and I've sourced the music from the Shovel Knight soundtrack by Jake Kaufman.</p>\n<p>Please give me some feedback on the project -- it is far from perfect and quite short and I intend to work on it some more in my free time.<br/><br/>Special thanks to the Digital Worlds Institute for help with troubleshooting and the dialogue system in the game as well as a thank you to everyone who takes the time to download and play  my little project.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Compatible with Windows only.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Borrowed Assets:</p>\n<p>\"Dragonslapper\" Font</p>\n<p>69 Game Over Jingles Pack</p>\n<p>8-Bit SFX</p>\n<p>Free Casual Game SFX Pack</p>\n<p>Vertical 2D Shooting Assets Pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:09:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d3d4f0442bf0293af7e9247db43c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Terra42"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
