It's a high score-based game where you try to survive for as long as possible inside a tight arena.</p>\n<p>You lose when you touch the sides of the arena. Your speed constantly rises, as does your score. You gain more points faster the closer you are to the edges of the arena. Your only method of control is changing direction by turning on a dime.</p>\n<p>It doesn't run perfectly on modern hardware, with the arena scaling being kinda messed up and partially off-screen when maximized, but you can run it in a window and resize it until the arena is properly visible.</p>\n<p>The game plays a Shepard tone; an auditory illusion that sounds like it's constantly rising.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/595e19ecbb28fbb6538881034e72638f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
