Including new sprites, music, tiles and such to add to the engine for these future games.</p>\n<p>There's also a browser based version though (a bit more limited I\u00a0think but pretty much the same) on the\u00a0page that the download's hosted through. So I decided to see what could be put together in a few hours using a browser tab, as well as\u00a0the built\u00a0in art and music. Basically what anyone would be able to chuck together once they open the link.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Along with being playable in an emulator (or plonked onto an itch page, like this game has been) the ROM file you can download after finishing up on your own NES game can be flashed on\u00a0to a NES cart (or\u00a0a NES Everdrive, or anything similar) and played on an actual NES console. It's amazing to see free software like this and GBStudio available nowadays.</p>\n<p>There should be around fifteen-thirty minutes of gameplay here too depending on how long it takes to finish certain parts.</p>\n<p>In those few hours I ended up also adding the goal of filling up all of the sixty four currently available levels in the engine with some kind of content. I kept the first eight template levels, made a bunch of my own puzzles...and added a ton of filler haha. But most of that filler involves creative peeps I\u00a0know and follow etc. Podcasts, websites, events, video makers, streamers, photographers. That kinda stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's still little puzzles there, but don't expect anything ground breaking haha. I'm preeetty sure this is a complete list of everyone shouted out in levels too if you wanna give their stuff a looksie:<br/></p>\n<p>Retrospekt</p>\n<p>Hack The Dino</p>\n<p>Slopes Game Room</p>\n<p>TheGrizzlyGrotto</p>\n<p>Sezza\r\n</p>\n<p>Rachelleum</p>\n<p>RetroBreak</p>\n<p>KindaSasha</p>\n<p>RonThePharaoh</p>\n<p>AVCon</p>\n<p>GBStudio Central</p>\n<p>Elvies</p>\n<p>There were a few more folks I\u00a0had listed to add but ended up running out of levels, so apologies to 'em. If I\u00a0make some kinda sequel expect to see folks and groups like\u00a0RetroFuture, GumpyFunction, PSCountry, RealOtakuGamer and GamesForJames shouted out.</p>\n<p>The last few levels of the game ended up being the ones I\u00a0put the most work into and are also my favourite. I should have added the idea I\u00a0had for 'em earlier on in the game so more folks get to see it buuut unfortunately inspiration sprung a bit late. So to anyone who gets all the way to the end; many thanks haha, honestly.</p>\n<p>If you find yeslef wanting to try Retro Puzzle Maker out and have a go at making your own NES game check it out here\u00a0and if you use Discord, have a peep at the channel here.</p>\n<p>Aaaanyway, sorry for the wall of text but hope ya enjoy the lil game. And keep and eye out for the next thing I put together using Retro Puzzle Maker. Have a few ideas floating 'round in me noggin.<br/><br/>Peace out and stay safe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T13:16:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2c1099ca793fd18c9ab21cfa7a15292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GameBuoyGames - Michael Towns"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
