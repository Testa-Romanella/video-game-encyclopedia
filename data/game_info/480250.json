The central mechanic is that the player can\u00a0<em>rebound </em>by jumping again as soon as they hit the ground, up to nearly the same height they were before. The purpose of the game is to bounce around huge 3D spaces rising higher and higher, with your jumps becoming longer and ever-more dangerous.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Click on the game and move the mouse to look around.</li><li>W - move forward</li><li>A - move left</li><li>S - move backward</li><li>D - move right</li><li>Spacebar - jump, rebound, and wall jump</li></ul>\n<p>The source code for this game can be found on github.
