{"id": 55370, "slug": "boppin-2", "name": "Boppin'", "name_original": "Boppin'", "description": "<p>Boppin&#39; is a puzzle-oriented video game created by Jennifer Diane Reitz in 1991, developed under the company name Accursed Toys and published by Karmasoft for the Amiga computer with only 32 colors on screen. Around that time Karmasoft held a level design contest. The game sold poorly with 284 copies, so Jennifer got it republished by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms) with up to 256 colors on screen. Due to mature content containing blood and Seppuku, the game was rated for players aged 25.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:46:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65b8b72f361768de8ee84e700cfd68d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Accursed Toys"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Apogee Software", "Apogee", "Karmasoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
