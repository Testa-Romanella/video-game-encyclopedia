The crew is in cryosleep, bound for a distant asteroid.</p>\n<p>As the ship's \"caretaker bot,\" you are responsible for allocation of the now-precious energy reserves. Solve puzzles by powering different objects around the ship, and enter simulations created from the crewmembers' memories. It is your task to ensure that all available power is concentrated in the crew life support systems, in the hope that they will be kept alive until rescue. But what if all the power on the ship simply isn't enough?</p>\n<p>Aiku is the culmination of Columbia College Chicago's 2018 large team game capstone course - a nine-month collaborative project involving over forty students.
