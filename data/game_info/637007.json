Meet other unforgetable characters like: The bug or the scarecrow! Sounds like super much fun, doesn't it? Just press the start button above this description and your journey begins! Do it.

I will try to \"shitpost\" less for my upcoming projects. Also, I've had pretty poor time management on this one, so this release has not the same level of polish than Your Average Lift Experience. I still gave my very best, enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93b6eee0b17243335840fdb4215e208f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Katsuhira"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
