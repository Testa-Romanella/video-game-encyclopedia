You play as Cole Flux, a Psychic with mysterious powers and one of the stranded travelers. You must navigate him throughout the island to not only search for his lost companion but to also solve the 'curse' that is slowly seeping the island. Fortunately and unfortunately, you will not be alone.</p><p> As you navigate, you will find more companions along the way. You will be able to use weapons to battle against the monsters that wander the island. However, beware that the monsters will not only test your skills, but your tactics as well. There is more than one way to kill a monster, but there are lots of ways to die in battle. It will be a difficult journey in more ways than one.</p><p>---</p><p>How to control your Character:</p><p>Arrow Keys = Move Character</p><p>X Button = Pause/Menu Button</p><p>Space Button = Click/Event Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/2144156d0b439ccf11463ae61363351f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ngearhead"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
