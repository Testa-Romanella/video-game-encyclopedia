It's full of spiders.</h3><br/>The one good thing about spiders was that once you left Earth, you didn\u2019t have to deal with them very much. Now they\u2019ve invaded the ENTIRE multiverse. <br/><br/>But wherever there exist spiders, there exist those destined to face them down: The Exterminators. That's you, by the way. So strap in, take a deep breath and plunge headlong into one of these interdimensional portals.<br/><br/>That's what we pay you for! You are being paid, right?<br/><br/><h3>Play with friends in four player co-op or go head-to-head in Spider Hunt PvP</h3><br/>But you don\u2019t need to face your fears alone! Collect your three least arachnophobic friends and play through the entire game in a 4-player, online co-op mode. <br/><br/>Friends not pulling their weight? Challenge them to prove themselves in \u201cSpider Hunt\u201d, a Spiders vs. Exterminators PvP mode where you can play as an arachnid for the first time. Throw webs to slow exterminators down, perform daring acts of parkour to escape justice, or simply hide in a vase and watch the chaos unfold while laughing manically.<br/><br/>Of course, the Exterminators will have a host of tools and weapons to hunt spiders down, so you better hope nobody has picked up the tracker...<br/><br/><h3>Arm yourself with the latest in sci-fi weaponry</h3><br/>Utilize the latest advancements in cutting-edge multiverse technology and upgrades to hunt down the arachnids, then exploit their classic Achilles heel: FLAMES \u2014 or lead showers. Or earth-shattering kabooms, remote control vehicles, lasers\u2026 crushing under heavy objects\u2026 honestly, they're pretty weak to most forms of violence.<br/><br/><h3>Game Features</h3><ul><li>Scream like a big baby when a spider is lurking under your laser pistol.<br/></li><li>Murder that spider for startling you.
