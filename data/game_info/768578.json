So I made an alternate soundtrack for their new game Marzipan Beef Reverser. Maybe I'll work at Videlectrix someday.</p>\n<p>Advance through the tracks by pressing [Right] or Z (the A-Button). Backtrack by pressing [Left] or X (the B-Button).</p>\n<p>You can download this as a .gb rom to play on your favorite Game Boy (or emulator) as a music cartridge! Sorry, I'm not able to export to Analogue Pocket format at this time...</p>\n<p>Images are from the already-existing game. Music is by me, Sloopygoop, based on the original tunes from the game.\u00a0Check out more of my music here and here.\u00a0And if you're looking to hire someone to make .mod files for your Game Boy game...
