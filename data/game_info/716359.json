If you go too far in the air, a parachute will deploy to get the ball safely back down to the ground. (Controls and parachute not yet implemented!)</p><p>Known issues: It's possible to bounce back to the left and fall off the platform, and if it does it may continue to do so until the game page is reloaded. It may also go so fast it starts skipping making new ground and might fall that way, and then the ball will fall forever until the page is refreshed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f0/1f06f07d8cf46b1fc0c33c4dd0025e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JimOfLeisure"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
