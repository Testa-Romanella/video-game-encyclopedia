You can try to use color sticker note or ping-pong ball. Notes are easier to attach but tend to change their color when tilted so balls can prove a better alternative.\r\n </p>\n<p>Choose marker with contrasting color, green and blue will do nicely, assuming you don't have anything that color in the background.\r\n </p>\n<p>If you do not have color marker you can try black and white one. Print the provided file and depending on your camera setup choose the one best working. Remember tracking bw marker is more expensive. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Windows version does not provide head tracking.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc7cccb89025ac6053bf41251bb95128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["pkowal1982"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
