It's currently in development, and I'm looking for what feedback I can gather.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry for the \"programmer art\" by the way. I have no idea how to draw, so this is what you get. If you are an artist and want to help out, please ping me. \ud83d\ude0a</p>\n<p><strong>An important note about money:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It would be incredibly immoral to make money off of the\u00a0Ru\u03df\u03dfian invasion of Ukraine, which is why I ask you to please donate to Ukraine during the \"game over\" screen. However, I have decided to leave the option to pay for the game on itch.io as well. That is because at the end of each month I will forward all of that money to a trusted charity and my employer will match 100% of the amount. You are welcome to take this option if you wish to maximize your donation. That said,\u00a0I understand that unless you know me personally this would require you to trust a stranger on the Internet, which is rarely a good idea. In the end I just encourage you to donate directly to the charity above or to any other one. Ukraine needs any help we can provide!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T09:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01d35fe8443cc585a5cb393469277c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mortarman"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
