There are dangerous sky pirates on the loose and you will have to be\r\nquick to use an arsenal of different cannons and weapons to combat them.  The goal is to reach the town in one piece or\r\nto gain as many points as possible to achieve the highest score.</p><p>You can first choose your sky ship equipped with cannons and\r\n3 other unique abilities and weapons. You may then also choose a captain to\r\ncommand your ship these captains will bring unique abilities to the table that will\r\nbe inherited by your chosen Skyship. Each captain is completely unique and the\r\ncombinations you choose for your captains and Skyships will change how you\r\nplay.
