The\u00a0Spectrum scene online, and the people in it, has changed dramatically\u00a0in that time, leading to a completely new set of people contributing\u00a0levels and audio for the game. The game itself is a spiritual\u00a0successor to W*H*B, but uses a different game mechanic and so required\u00a0a completely new engine (especially as the old engine couldn't actually\u00a0cope with the more populated levels), but is just as complex and\u00a0very difficult to master.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong>\u00a0- <strong>Sizzler</strong> - \"<em>X=Y=Z might be a\u00a0different style of game to W*H*B but is just as playable and even more\u00a0thought-provoking</em>\"\u00a0- 91%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5a/a5a0c09dfcac10a2a8af96eabb520abe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
