Governed by a string of beloved kings, the nation was wealthy, its people prosperous. That was in the past, however. Now, Artoire\u2019s fortunes are dwindling as constant wars and food shortages sweep the land. After innumerable hard years, the people of Artoire begin to despair. Fearing for the worst, they search for a messiah who can save them during their time of peril\u2026<br/><br/>And that messiah comes in the form of a fourteen-year-old girl called Liliane.<br/><br/>Liliane is a beautiful, charming, elegant young lady from the foreign land of Charentes, born to the noble Saint-Coeurs. Betrothed to the future king of Artoire, Liliane ascends to the throne upon the death of the old monarch, to public approval and rapturous applause.<br/><br/>With the passing of time, however, the public opinion towards Liliane turns. It soon transpires that the new queen is vain and flighty, and she cares not one jot about the plight of the common people. The death toll continues to rise, new wars loom on the horizon, and despair swells.<br/><br/>Betrayed and helplessly hurt, a young man called Marius becomes a key player in a revolt that will shake the society of Artoire to its very core. Once a street urchin enamoured with the queen, and now a lead revolutionary, Marius is faced with a difficult decision. Can he really bring the queen he once adored to justice\u2026 or will his old feelings ruin all he has been working for?<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Story by ebi-hime, author of Sweetest Monster and Blackberry Honey<br/></li><li>A handful of choices and five unique endings<br/></li><li>Around 60,000 words of text (approx 3-4 hours of reading)<br/></li><li>Detailed background and character art<br/></li><li>A custom OST<br/></li><li>1080p display<br/></li><li>Misery!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-25T13:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a49/a4965825eb763234b27bae04f8131159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ebi-hime"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["ebi-hime"], "esrb_rating": null}
