Humankind is part of one of two factions battling for the control of the multiverse. <br/>After a long time of stalemate, the enemy faction, led by the prince Kalkux, developed faster and more powerful spaceships, achieving important victories. <br/><br/>The human race started to lose faith in survival. Ships with artificial intelligence were not clever enough to handle new enemy ships. Remote controlling via quantum entanglement was not reliable in other universes.<br/><br/>On the brink of dispair, humans developed a new and faster ship, the \"REDSHIFT\" class, with a key innovation: a human pilot would be physically present in the ship. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Your mission is to take control of Redshift to expel the enemy from key galaxies and universes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c82f4ab39870372fcbb30b8413a62173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["World XXI Soft"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
