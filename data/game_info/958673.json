I will try to make the difficulty level harder when the level goes up. I have thought that if the player escapes from one place(starting point) to the endpoint, the player can move to the next level, and along the way, the enemies would be faster. Also, Adding new player abilities, such as a dash, fighting (attack and/or defense), or additional power-ups.</p>\n<p>2) Aesthetic Modification: To make the game bit more intensive and difficult \u00a0I will try to add additional significant and coherent graphical elements to the game, such as new enemies or environmental challenges, complete with animated states. \u00a0I will change the background and along with visual changes, I will change the audio.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) Gameplay Modification: I will figure out adding a unique behavior of the player. which can damage the enemies easily. To improve the enemies, I will work on the enemies' speed in order to make them faster or any damaging behavior towards the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by Md Towsif Sadab</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:36:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b60/b6094cc88770718f4782961d62e085ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["sadab_towsif"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
