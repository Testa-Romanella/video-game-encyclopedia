This app provides numerous practice questions in which Latin disciples can decline nouns and pronouns.\r\n</p>\n<p>The app contains various achievements to incentivize taking full advantage of the consistent practice Pedagogus provides.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>This was intended to be an app but I ran into troubles with publishing it on to both the app store and google play. Because of this it is easy to exploit; however, if you intend to actually practice declination then I recommend playing as intended.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Audio - Robert Moreland</p>\n<p>Special thanks - Dr. Allison Das</p>\n<p>Programming - Myself</p>\n<p>Art - Myself, made in Piskel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T08:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/080e534f531fa85cf5ce894715117607.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheTwoFingeredGlove"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
