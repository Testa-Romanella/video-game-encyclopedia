{"id": 117751, "slug": "project-bigid-prototype", "name": "Project Bigid (Prototype)", "name_original": "Project Bigid (Prototype)", "description": "<p>This is a small prototype for a first-person hunting-horror game about Bigfoot. I built it to test an overmap system, manual weapon control, some NPC dialogue, and the overall feel of the game concept. I doll'd it up a little, so it's playable. There is a complete game loop. It will take around 10 min or so to finish.</p>\n<p>You play as Joe Walsh at the start of his Cryptid hunting legacy during the summer of 1979. When Joe misses his catch back in Washington state to a mysterious adversary, his new contact in the tabloids digs up a potential case near a small town in Ohio. Joe races to the town in the hopes of beating \"them\" to it.</p>\n<p>The final game, aside from a massive overhaul of the visuals, will include more points of interest to unlock on the overmap, more characters to talk to, more gear to help you in the hunt, and a little bit of resource management. The final journal entry in this demo reveals the sinister antagonist planned for release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe8be31ac5debef462e088ccba363a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MallNinjaMax"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
