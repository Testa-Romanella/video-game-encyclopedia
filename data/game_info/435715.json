{"id": 435715, "slug": "slimekeep", "name": "Slimekeep", "name_original": "Slimekeep", "description": "<p>Slimekeep is a simple arcade game where you must shoot slimes strategically to earn the most points while staying alive. As slimes live longer and grow, they become worth more points. Occasionally voids will drop which also can help you defeat hoards of slimes. This game was made in less than 48 hours for the 46th Ludum Dare game jam. Also, if you are on a device without a 16:9 aspect ratio\u00a0(like most Macs), press the grayed-out fullscreen button to enter fullscreen. Otherwise hit the blue one.</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare Link -\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/slimekeep</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc00261c07aa32670737900e76614283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenBonk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
