Hey !!!</strong><br/>The flying is pretty unintuitive and people have been having trouble with it, so here's a quick tutorial:<br/><strong>When jumping, double tap the jump button as fast as you can and hold the second press. This will let you reach the max altitude.<br/></strong>Don't forget about the airdodge either!</p>\n<p>This will be fixed and made more intuitive and forgiving in the next build.<br/></p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this demo and would like to support this project, consider becoming a patron over at Patreon!</p>\n<p>Have questions or comments?
