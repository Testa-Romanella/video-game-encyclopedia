Theme: Bounce</p>\n<p>Checks Please is a game where the goal is to bounce checks as quickly as you can. A check will bounce if its value is larger than the amount of money in your bank account in the top right. If a check will bounce, you send it to your outbox. If a check will not bounce, or its value is lower than your bank account, you must throw it in the trash. More detailed instructions can be found in the game's How to Play section.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Arrow Key - Throw un-bounceable check in the trash</p>\n<p>Right Arrow Key - Send bounceable check to the outbox</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n<p>LootLocker SDK for leaderboards</p>\n<p>GUI PRO Kit - Casual Game by\u00a0IneptStudio\u00a0for our leaderboard sprites</p>\n<p>Orloj Font by Jonathan Paterson</p>\n<p><strong>Mungil Font</strong>\u00a0by gheraile</p><p>Everything else was created by the team.</p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Mastersimrad</p>\n<p>DJAnimeGirlFarts69</p>\n<p>Warlick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:04:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/738/7382b65e71b675bbd54b365abf2ab82c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mastersimrad"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
