LineWorlds are all developed in a home-made vector engine created with Game Maker. The only consistent rule of the LineWorld Universe is that everything be made of lines. A LineWorld game can be a platformer, top down flyer, or even a point and click adventure. The Music of LineWorld is collaged across levels creating a transforming musical experience that follows progression in the game. In the premiere game LineWorld:the First Story the protaganist is a small walking house that travels around several distinct levels. This introductory challenge serves as a proof of concept with dialogue from the developer of LineWorld.</p><p>If you have any ideas or want further information about Lineworld<br/>Please email me at jaredemjohnson@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c74ff4aae28458f8556a8ec9ddf3561.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jaredjohnson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
