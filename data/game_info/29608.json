{"id": 29608, "slug": "art-is-dead", "name": "Art Is Dead", "name_original": "Art Is Dead", "description": "<strong>Art is dead</strong> is a 2D top-down shooter that redefines the idea of AI enemies. In this game, walls are your enemy. You can't hide behind them, you can't use them to your advantage, and your bullets can't pass through them. Meanwhile, enemies can move freely through the map and they will chase you to your death. No matter how deep you are into the game, one stupid mistake can end your kill spree abruptly, so be careful and never underestimate your enemies. In addition to this, there's a deep lore behind the game explained in a very easy way, so you don't have to read long texts or memorize multiple names, just enjoy the way everything unfolds.<br/><br/><br/>Enemies are optimized to make your life there miserable. If you think you are fast enough, a new soul will approach you with terrifying speed while dodging your useless bullets. If you think your weapons are strong enough, a new soul will appear in the darkness, coming to you slowly but resisting all your damage. If you think you have everything under control, which you should never do, your surroundings will become the playground of a sneaky soul only visible through your lantern. All of them will tear you apart in seconds, so you better get away from them and think fast. These are not the only enemies there are, so don't get cocky and learn from all their movements.<br/><br/><br/>The game has two main modes:<br/>- <strong>Ego chamber</strong>: If you want to understand the lore of the game, this is where you should go. It can be done in a very short amount of time, but it's very challenging and can become frustrating at times. Each level works as a checkpoint, but be aware of every trick the joker soul tries to pull on you. You can lose all your progress if you are not careful and be forced to start the Ego chamber from the start. The more you advance, the more things you'll understand, and the more challenging enemies will become.<br/>- <strong>Survival</strong>: Just to have fun and break scores. Make use of the best weapons, the best strategies, and the best equipment so you can last the most rounds possible. Just try not to break all the lights, you'll miss them on late rounds. You can choose from 2 different maps. Survival Corridor is composed of 27 rounds designed manually to make the experience there frustrating and difficult. You'll need to explore the map in search of better equipment and not get trapped in narrow corridors. Combat Arena on the other hand is very easy to explore, and rounds are randomly generated. If you have the patience and skills to get to round 100, that's a win, but I doubt you are capable of that.<br/><br/>**************************************************************************<br/><br/>Although this description may sound a little serious, the game has a very defined sense of humor. For every achievement you complete, a new skin will be unlocked so you can be more stylish while killing tormented souls. Some of them have a very rough sense of humor, while others are just cute, fun, or related to other products of Darkhunter Studios.<br/><br/>So, what are you waiting for? For the price of a Happy Meal, you can hold the power to execute indiscriminate genocide on poor little sad souls. If you ask me, it's a safe bet.<br/><br/>We are thinking of adding multiplayer to the game, which would increase a lot the hours of entertainment. If we see a good reception from the players, we will start with the development and you will be able to enjoy the game with your friends in less than a week. You know what people say, genocide with friends tastes way better", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T03:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/339/339dae6d0dda1f7b3133587484f082d4.jpg", "website": "http://www.smallrockets.com/pc/artisdead/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Small Rockets", "Darkhunter Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Real Networks", "Darkhunter Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
