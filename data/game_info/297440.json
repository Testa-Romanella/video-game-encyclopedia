Now it\u2019s time to find out which one are YOU!<br/><br/>Welcome to the wet and wild world of ultimate fishing, where you play as the FISHERMAN! You are the master of the fishing rod, line and lure. With real physics.<br/><br/>FISHERMAN is a spiritual sequel to an old game that many people in Finland remember! It was a game where gnome type of troll just sat fishing for her wife. Or was it an albino hippo? It was so long ago that my memories get hazy... But events set in destiny made this game come back to life in this new form.<br/><br/>This time you don't sit and you are not a troll. You stand up and you are human (kinda) and most importantly - you fish again! With real physic. Randomly generated whoppers. Just like it was always meant to be. Take your time. Fishing is not about skill, it\u2019s not about fast reflexes or polished technique. Fishing is about taking your time, relaxing, catching and hatching rare and exotic fishes and by that slowly progressing towards a new location. Find new fishes, purchase better gear, try new looks and venture to new areas in search of almost legendary fishes, that nobody has ever seen.<br/><br/>List of Features:<br/>(lists are needed to make this text appear longer and us to look more professional.
