It is about picking up the missing Space Station parts (as the theme \"Something is missing\" goes). I've spent most of the time writing codes and building up game level, and there isn't much time left for game testing. I will keep testing the gameplay, but please don't hesitate to report any BUG you've encountered.</p><p>In order to meet the requirement of the game jam, this game has WebGL version. However, it is recommended to download the executable version of the game to get better graphics and performance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/39776a6389ddc9e516cdfdf709e13712.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VincentHu0326"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
