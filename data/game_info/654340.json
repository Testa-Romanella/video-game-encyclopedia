The Big Bad Wolf has transformed into a blood thirsty werewolf with flying abilities ...although he may be the worst pilot ever. There is no way for Little Red to escape.<br/></p>\n<p><em>This is my first attempt to create a 2D game using Unity. I also created my own sprites. It was an interesting project  that taught me a numerous of skills. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the development process. Oh.., in case you are wondering, the art style of the game is intentional (even the menu buttons and the terrible resolution of the sprites). The whole point of this project was to create something playable without loosing myself in the perfectionism-procrastination loop.<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>A: Move Left<br/></p>\n<p>S: Move Right</p>\n<p>Space: Jump<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:01:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3a/c3aa9c30f12eb7c5f9c3f698d83c16a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["georgegkas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
