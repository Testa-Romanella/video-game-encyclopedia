With medical supplies running low, she'll have to make do with the bar's limitless supply of alcohol to treat her wounds... Will the zombies get her before alcohol poisoning does?</p>\n<p>P.S.

WASD to move, Left Mouse Button to shoot!<br/>2. Barrels contain beer in them; shoot the barrels to break them!<br/>3. Beer heals you fully, but incurs one random penalty from the following list:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Movement leaning effect<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Accuracy down<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Color distortion<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Screen blur<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Ripple distortion<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Unstable camera<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 - Tilting camera<br/>4. Penalties are permanent and stack with one another, and can get higher in intensity!<br/>5. Drinks are a multiplier to your final score; the drunker you get, the higher the multiplier!</p>\n<p>======================================</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>- MagicaVoxel - Voxel art<br/>- bfxr.net - Sound effects<br/>- abundant-music.com - Randomly generated music<br/>- GXSCC - Coverting Midi to 8bit<br/>- Audacity - Cropping audio<br/>- Unity - Game engine</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b4/8b4d0667dd4b8cb65095ad18c7f24e65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JunoStriker"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
