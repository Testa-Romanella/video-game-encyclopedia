In this simple point-and-click village management sim you can construct magnificent projects, make scientific discoveries, and eventually build up your village to its full potential. Make sure to keep your villagers well fed, and watch as generations of your islanders transform a driftwood-littered beach into a colorful community.<br/><br/>Idle Island runs in real time, so be sure to check in on your villagers every few hours or days to ensure they're doing well and keeping busy. \u00a0It typically takes 1-2 weeks of casual play  to experience everything Idle Island has to offer.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm\u00a0 continuously working Idle Island, so any feature suggestions or feedback is welcome! If you fill out my very short feedback form here, you can add a name to the pool of random villager names available in the game.</p>\n<p>There is a lightweight .jar file available for those who have java, otherwise grab a Windows or Mac .zip file to get playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T05:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28b/28b8d2abf437da9e199efb73d086d6cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["No Problem Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
