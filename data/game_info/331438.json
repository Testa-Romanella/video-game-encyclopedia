It was posted on Newgrounds before the Portal system launched in 2000; I eventually uploaded it to the Portal in 2006 so people could vote on it and leave reviews.</p>\n<p>This story has since been re-told with Pico&#39;s School: Love Conquers All.</p>\n<p>Pico was made in Flash 3, before the introduction of variables (or just about any code, for that matter). To simulate stored data, I weaved a complex web of movie clips that gave orders to the main game. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t aware of frame labels, so all the commands referred to frame numbers, making things difficult to edit afterwards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-03T20:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/badcbda1c9985d39d8409cdee1cca50d.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/310349", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
