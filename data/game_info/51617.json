As preparation for an impending Ice Age, a new project, half science experiment half live-entertainment, is launched. It&#39;s called &quot;Darwin Project&quot; and it challenges 10 participants to survive the cold and fight to the death in a treacherous arena.<br />\nKEY FEATURES:<br />\n- MANHUNT &amp; SURVIVAL:<br />\nTrack the position of enemies, by using environmental clues they left behind and be creative with your use of crafted traps to take the upperhand. The biting cold of the Northern Canadian Rockies will also slowly freeze you should you be careless.<br />\nWatch our Dev Diary #1: The Manhunt  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMsJSzGhQds<br />\n- SHOW DIRECTOR:<br />\nThe Show Director is the living bridge between the players and spectators. He/She is the host and master who controls the arena with nuclear bombs, zone closures, gravity storms, and the power of their voice. This could be a real tool of self discovery; the start of your new career as a charming but deadly game show host.<br />\n- LIVE SPECTATOR INTERACTIONS:<br />\nStream viewers on Mixer<em> can also bet live on the competitors they think will reign supreme, in addition to helping the Show Director choose targets for their arena-shaping powers. Whether they\u2019re voting on which player deserves a death-defying heal or which zone to nuke, it\u2019s time for spectators to become active participants in the manhunt!<br />\nTo try out this feature, Darwin Project devs will be hosting matches on https://mixer.com/DarwinProject as Show Directors during the entire duration of the Open beta weekend (from 4pm to 7pm (EST)).<br />\nConsult our Mixer broadcast schedule http://www.scavengers.ca/live-spectator-interactions-broadcast-schedule-mixer/.<br />\n</em>Twitch integration in on its way, stay tuned!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfe/dfe48baa20b1a6be5953999035622c65.jpg", "website": "http://www.scavengers.ca/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 1579, "beaten": 14, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 134, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 194, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 195, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scavengers Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scavengers Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
