In Ad Infinitum, you play as a German soldier haunted by the horrors of the Great War. While your mind grapples with memories of your family home and the trenches on the front, you try to break the endless cycle of suffering.<br />\nBETWEEN A DREAM AND REALITY<br />\nYou wake up in your bedroom, unchanged from your teenage years, in a run-down and deserted manor house. Suddenly and inexplicably, you are transported to the trenches where the horrors of war are overshadowed by vile and even more terrifying creatures. Unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare, you must fight to regain control of your life&#39;s narrative.<br />\nNIGHTMARES THAT BECOME REAL<br />\nUnspeakable nightmares come to life in the recesses of your mind. To escape the death traps and terrifying creatures, you must understand the source and motivation of each monster and solve the puzzles that stand in your way. From blind demons who can hear your softest footsteps to hideous disjointed puppets who move in the dark, horror is around every corner.<br />\nA FAMILY TORN APART<br />\nThe fallout of the war is felt far from the front. Peel back the shroud that hides the secrets of your family, torn apart by the Great War, and try to remember your past. Through exploration and by solving riddles and puzzles between the walls of your home and the barbed wire of No Man\u2019s Land, you ultimately reveal a chapter in the story of a German family torn apart by war.<br />\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1234430/Ad_Infinitum/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T21:02:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9b/d9b676027a253474e281ff405bfecf4b.jpg", "website": "http://ad-infinitum-game.de/", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 14, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5"], "developers": ["Hekate"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Nacon"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
