Along the way the crew will have to fight, making sacrifices to themselves and their sanity, and question their own boundaries of what they will do to survive.</p>\n\n\r\nInfluences\r\n<p>Games like Battleship,\u00a0Oregon Trail, and FTL</p>\n<p>Films like Alien,\u00a0Star Wars, and Interstellar<br/></p>\n<p>Music from this playlist:</p>\n\n\n\r\nCombat Prototype\r\n<p>Voyage is currently in early development. The latest build release is a <strong><em>prototype </em></strong>of the combat system for the game. That means that many features are unbalanced or missing, and that there is\u00a0a lot of unpolished and placeholder content. It is unoptimized.\u00a0There are also bugs.</p>\n<p>Our goal with this prototype is to test the core mechanics of combat - weak points, targeting, and crew control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The prototype should give you a good sense of the direction we want to go with Voyage. We want it to be dark, difficult, and unforgiving. It's missing many of the features we would like have to make it more fun and replayable, but those will come as we develop the game further, and\u00a0hopefully you can be a part of that.</p>\n\r\nFuture Development\r\n\n<p>The combat prototype is the first major milestone for the development of Voyage. Below is our current plan for milestones, up to release and subject to change:</p>\n<ul><li>Combat prototype</li><li>Traveling prototype</li><li>Game loop demo</li><li>Steam Early Access release</li><li>Full release</li></ul>\n<p>The traveling prototype is our next major milestone. It will be what\u00a0connects combat encounters,\u00a0like the one from the combat prototype, together through an interactive star map. Each encounter will represented by signals that the player travels between to progress.</p>\n<p><em>* Until we receive funding to work on the game full time, our development speed will be significantly reduced. Because of this, it's difficult to predict our release schedule. Currently our scope has the three of us working full time for around a year and a half to complete the game.\u00a0</em></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\n<p><strong>Camera Controls</strong><br/>Rotate camera: Right Mouse Hold</p>\n<p><strong>Targeting</strong><br/>(with targeting active)<br/>Place target: Right Mouse<br/>Cancel target: Left Mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Crew Controls</strong><br/>Select single: Left Mouse<br/>Select multiple: Left Mouse and drag<br/>Navigate to position: Right mouse</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Keys</strong><br/>Abilities: 1 - 3<br/>Show tactical overlay: Tab</p>\n\n\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n<p>TBD</p>\n<p>The shader we're using to show damage on the ship uses tessellation and displacement, and won't work on older graphics cards or certain integrated graphics systems.
