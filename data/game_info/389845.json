Made just for us.</h3><br/>Cats are Liquid - A Better Place is a 2D platformer about a liquid cat and her friends.<br/><br/>You play as the cat, in a place created just for you and your friends. You get to go on a nice adventure with them where nothing goes wrong and everything is perfect, as long as your friends stay there, right by your side.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you get to explore 120 rooms and discover new abilities like the hookshot and light burst.<br/><br/>You can also create your own worlds, and share them with others through the Steam Workshop. All of the rooms in the game were made using the same editor that's included in the game. So if you see something in an official world, you can do that in your own custom world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-31T12:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f36/f3651c0653436fa3e42132202c167758.jpg", "website": "https://catsareliquid.lastquarterstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Last Quarter Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Last Quarter Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
