I used characters and sound effects from Advanced Education with Viktor Strobovski by mrdrnose.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Viktor Strobovski took over Baldi's schoolhouse. And he brought some of his friends! Since this is an elementary school, Viktor decided to give his students easy examples. I mean, they are really easy. So you can do that, right? What could possibly go wrong? It's not like he'll chop off your head if you do something wrong. Anyway, you know the drill: Collect 7 notebooks and don't make mistakes. Viktor doesn't like mistakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Afterword</strong></p>\n<p>Check out Advanced Education with Viktor Strobovski! It's a very cool and challenging game.
