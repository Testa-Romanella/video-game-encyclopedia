The usual \"HP Bar\", and the more unique and complex \"HEAT METER\". The heat meter includes many positives and many negatives. As your heat meter rises you gain new abilities, but if it rises to 100%, you OVERHEAT. Once in OVERHEAT, you will start burning to death unless you cool down in time (either on a cool-down platform or not attacking or not taking damage). This is a resource management game as you try to maintain strong abilities while not dying due to overuse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game!\r\n</p>\r\nLore\r\n<p>A traveling robot must go to learn the secrets of its origin. Show the fires of your passion.</p>\r\nAsset Credits\r\n<p><strong>All sprites made\u00a0by Taneim</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SFX Produced by Nick</strong><br/></p>\n<p>MUSIC\r\n</p>\n<p>Astro Race - Zapsplat\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/music/astro-race-mid-tempo-electro-music-with-a-spacey-...</p>\n<p>When It is Getting Dark -\u00a0lemonmusicstudio https://pixabay.com/music/action-when-it-is-getting-dark-15303/</p>\r\nPRESENTATION\r\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T14:54:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f6e497da6ffc7d03383136d1e290c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["broomen", "NiravGolyalla", "Taneim"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
