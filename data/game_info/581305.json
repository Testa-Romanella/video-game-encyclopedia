With a 7 x 7 board and 10 colors, the player is given 2 colors each turn. The player may rotate and move these 2 colors how they like and drop them into the board. The player is shown what the next 2 colors will be. When 3 colors are connected (vertically, horizontally, or adjacently) they will all disappear and transform into the next color in the sequence (shown at the bottom of the game board). The player is shown what the next two colors will be, this can often change the plan for the current two colors.<br/><br/>Three Unique Game Modes<br/><br/>Classic<br/><br/>An empty board and the ultimate challenge to continuously plan and organize colors from the start. How long can you survive? How can you organize so that all colors will be useful?<br/><br/>Daily<br/><br/>A unique challenge. Each day a new board is generated and the board is the same for everyone! All the future colors will also be generated in the same way. Players compete from across the world to see who can get the best score with the same exact starting position.<br/><br/>Special<br/><br/>The same as Daily mode only there is a power up to delete the current colors.<br/><br/>How Does Scoring Work?<br/><br/>Points are scored when merges are made. If 3 pinks merge into 1 red the player receives 3 points. Combos will multiple points. If 3 pinks merge into 1 red which creates a new merge of 3 reds to an orange, which creates a new merge of 3 oranges into a yellow.  The player gets 3 + (6 * 2) + (9 * 3). This creates huge incentives for big combos but preparing for big combos can be risky if the colors needed to complete the combos don't arrive.<br/><br/><br/>No Ads or In-App Purchases allow for a distraction free gaming experience. Merge was created by a single developer who hates the current state of mobile games and wants to try to offer better games at an affordable price.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T13:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/5677368a275b69ed38ff981d8f6a34e4_FNcCrQk.jpg", "website": "https://bubbl.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Andrew Beers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Andrew Beers"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
