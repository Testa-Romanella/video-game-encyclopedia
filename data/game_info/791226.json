(Uploaded in Screenshots)</p>\n<p>The game was supposed to be a small to medium-sized interactive narrative visual novel with puzzles that give the player direct control. This of course, like all game development, started as an idea that grew in complexity.</p>\n<p>The story for the game revolves around Lego mini-figures and the owner of the Lego mini-figures. The issues faced by transgendered people and those suffering from body dysmorphia and spreading awareness about them are the focus of the story. A reference to real-world issues such as overly authoritative figures, that impact society negatively instead of positively as they are supposed to, is also made.<br/><br/>Click with the left mouse button or with space to progress through the story part of the game, and click on the lego blocks in the mini-games to rotate them and connect them all to progress.\u00a0<br/><br/>USED ASSETS :\u00a0https://fungusgames.com/\u00a0,\u00a0<br/>https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/open-peeps</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T15:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10d975d352c21db7aa844b12cb1cdf38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
