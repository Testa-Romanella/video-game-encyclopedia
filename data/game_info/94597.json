Inspired by games like Pok\u00e9mon and FTL - every playthrough will be a unique challenge.</p><p>The year is 2038. It has been twenty years since the Rending - an event that left most of the world's population dead, their souls severed from their bodies. These souls linger, and survive as ghosts.</p><p>There are rumours of humans developing supernatural abilities. Apparently there are people possessing the same magical abilities as the ghosts, and even people able to control the ghosts themselves.</p><p>Ghostlords tells the stories of these individuals and the world they live in.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d518ebfd5a14f27f91c510713adfe982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HelixFox"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
