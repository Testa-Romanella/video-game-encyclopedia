Made in Java.</p>\n<p>The main difference is that different ships have different roles. You have ships that can search the enemy board (lookouts), ships that can block incoming shots (destroyers), ships that can build other ships (frigates), and last but not least, ships that can fire on the enemy board (battleships).\u00a0You can read the rules of the game in-game by clicking on the '?' or the '...' button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The offline mode allows you to play locally with another player. In order for you to avoid seeing each other's boards on the same screen, you will be shown a mostly blank screen after your turn is over, then your opponent will manually start their turn once they've made sure you can't see the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game also features an online mode, which is more ideal, but requires some knowledge of IP addresses/servers to begin. More detailed instructions about how to play online are provided if you press the '?' button on the online menu.</p>\n<p>Feel free to resize the window.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2f/d2f7ff5a72d56c5756725b11b26ef745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Trouv"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
