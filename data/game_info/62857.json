You can create thousands of planets and explore each one entirely in room scale virtual reality. Create icy, molten, rocky or Earth like worlds, each with unique features and terrain. And, after finding one you like, teleport to its surface and explore every mountain, valley and ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExoplanet is inspired by the classic PC game Starflight. Almost everything you see in Exoplanet is created during runtime.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/0263ca959e3e488eba0661c36d1a1981.jpg", "website": "https://github.com/GreggBzz/FracPlanet", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregg Brzozowski"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Gregg Brzozowski"], "esrb_rating": null}
