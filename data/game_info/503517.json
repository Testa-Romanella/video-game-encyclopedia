An addicting game, perfect for those bored with their lives and in need of that wonderful brazilian spice in their lives - and phones! Join in now for a chance to acquire the elusive, mistifying and VERY friendly: Brasil-Chan! She's the best unit in the game and will definetly help you with all your raiding needs, too!~\u00a0</p>\r\nWarning, EDC is not responsible for any addictions or compellings you might feel during your gameplay with Carnaval Destiny Idol. Play under your own discretion.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n<p>...But seriously, <strong>as much as we enjoy gachas, we are well aware of its dangers on a lot of vulnerable people<em>.</em></strong>\u00a0This game is supposed to be a satire - both a comically humorous one, and a serious one. <strong>It's both a cautionary tale and a celebration of what makes us love - or hate - that genre, too<em>.\u00a0</em></strong>You play as a tired, bored worker, living their lives in the same way as always. This game brings quite a bit of colour into your life - but it doesn't come cheap to try and get the coveted 5-star Brasil-chan. Peer pressure and in-game incentives will keep you hooked until you get her... or something else happens.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong>: <em>Mouse Only</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Adherence to the Jam's Theme</em></strong>: <strong>We explore both the addicting loops provided by gachas, as well as have our protagonist stuck on a loop of their own: Their own job and life.</strong>\u00a0There are only a few ways to escape the in-game loop, and we hope you enjoy trying your best!</p>\n\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Resources</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Engine:\u00a0<em>Unity2019.4.11f1\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art: <em>2D</em> -\u00a0<em>Clip Studio Paint<br/>3D - Maya &amp; Substance Painter</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Programming:\u00a0<em>Visual Studio</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound: FL Studio</strong></p>\n<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n<br/><br/>\n<strong><em>Credits</em></strong>\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Art</strong>\n<br/><br/>Bruna \"<strong><em>Kida</em></strong>\" Chagas - Character Designer and Illustration - Twitter: @kidakashArts<br/><strong>Melissa</strong> Pinto - 3D Modelling, Texturing &amp; Environmental Artist<br/><br/><strong>Game Design</strong><br/><br/>Gabriel \"<strong><em>Cyber Twilight</em></strong>\" Medeiros - Project Management &amp; Technical Game Design - Twitter: @CyberTwilight<br/>Isabela \"<strong><em>Zeppeli</em></strong>\" Pimenta - UI Design &amp; Game Design - Twitter: @Zeppeli_<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong>\n<br/><br/>Gustavo <strong>Krieger</strong> - UI &amp; Structure\u00a0Programmer - Twitter: @krigolino | GitHub: /GMKrieger</p>\n<p>Gabriel \"<em><strong>Fencer</strong></em>\" Dantas - Systems Programmer - Twitter: @BFencerMusashi</p>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Fabio</strong> Araujo - Music &amp; Sound Design - Twitter: @vadiasexy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T07:57:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/33714cb1476493a6fc7bbfeebf2efcc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyber Twilight", "Kidakash", "BFencer", "littletoymaker"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
