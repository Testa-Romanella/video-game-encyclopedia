By any means necessary, fight your way through the other Ennas and\u00a0find a way out of the compound in this really short game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made this game after playing some simple RPG Maker games and thought to myself, \"I can do that too\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>I can't.</p>\n<p>It was just supposed to be a shitpost maze game for Enna's return but I had too much fun with it, the scope got too big, and eventually I got bored with it\u00a0so you can tell that the game is unfinished. So rather than just dropping the entire thing, I'm publishing it as is.</p>\n<p>Did I playtest it?
