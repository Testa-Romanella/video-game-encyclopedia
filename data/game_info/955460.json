Your goal is to catch salt molecules and proteins to start forming the crystal while carefully monitoring the solubility gauge. Once you reach the nucleation zone, you must grow the crystal within a strict time limit of 60 seconds, avoiding salt molecules to prevent degradation.</p>\n<p>Can you rise to the challenge and become a master of protein crystallization by crafting the ultimate crystal?
