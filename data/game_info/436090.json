Deal-it Cards is an interactive way to play cards that gives you more control over the playing cards. You are given a deck of cards and you must pull each one out of the deck then tap it again to flip it over. You can play to the rules of Solitaire, Free Cell, or more. You can even choose to play with 2 decks for more complicated card games. Also, you may reshuffle for a new deck at any time.<br/><br/>song credits:<br/>Sunrise by Alex Blesener on the album, 'Kiosk at The Mall'", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T01:52:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b97c0f8a9c0bfeaa63d28754b1cba14f_L3BqsX4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Blesener"], "genres": ["Casual", "Card"], "publishers": ["Alexander Blesener"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
