If you get 2 or less you'll receive 3 as damage.<br/>- You have to decide: risk a higher number to give the other player more damage, or play it more safely and don't risk yourself.<br/>- You have to pay attention in what color the other player is as well, and roll the dice before he/she move to a safe smaller number color.</p>\n<p><strong>DICE FIGHT!:</strong><br/>- If both dices stay in the same piece a Dice Fight! will start.<br/>- Press the roll button as many times as you can!<br/>- In Dice Fight! you won't have to wait the roll animation to get the numbers, a number between 1 and 6 is generated instantly, and you can roll your dice as many times as you can within the time limit.<br/>- The numbers you get are added together in a score.<br/>- Once the time stops, the player that got the higher score wins and the difference between the two numbers is given as damage to the other player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f3/6f3fce1606bebe5eafc6990afcaf8b67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Davi Fox"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
