Users are invited to play the role of a Vietnamese person in a distant future who found the digitized consciousness of one of their ancestors in a machine with all their memories and buried family secrets.<br/></p>\r\nGoals\r\n<p>By telling the stories of women in my own family, I hope to help myself and young Vietnamese people of my generation understand the lived experience of our foremothers in a more empathetic way.</p>\n<p>By experimenting with speculative storytelling, I also want the audience to think about the legacy that could be lost to time as women continue to be left outside of the archive, and their voices are silenced.</p>\r\nHistorical and cultural context\r\n<ul><li>A lot of the stories of women who lived through the Indochina War and Vietnam War were not recorded in history textbooks in Vietnam.</li><li>Stories of women who lived through wars survived in the stories that they tell their children and grandchildren.\u00a0</li><li>Those stories need to be preserved and told to future generations, or they will be lost to time.</li><li>Hau Dong, a spirit summoning ritual in the worshipping of mother goddesses, is a way to communicate with deities, the spirits of ancestors.</li><li>It is often used by families to look for people who died far away from home.</li><li>There is no religious text. The tradition is preserved through songs and dance.</li></ul>\r\nCredit:\r\n<p>This project used both my own 3D assets and stock assets that have been licensed for this project.</p>\n<p>Waterfall and water portal\u00a0model and shader created by Zhicun Wang.</p>\n<p>This project used PoseCore for body movement tracking with webcam.
