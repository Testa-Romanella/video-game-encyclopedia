The theme \u201cRewind\u201d gave us the idea to time travel to the past, in Prehistory time to be precise. <br/>The player found a portal in his room, he will be sucked into it and will land in prehistoric times. Many monsters will appear, and the player need to defeat them with his slingshot, the only weapon he will have with him. But that\u2019s not all, he can also gain a power of repulsion after defeating 15 enemies. This power allow the player to repulse all the monsters on the screen, and he can also move and attack during this time lapse.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can set the game on the \u201cOptions\u201d section, choose between Qwerty or Azerty keyboard, by default the game will be in Qwerty.
