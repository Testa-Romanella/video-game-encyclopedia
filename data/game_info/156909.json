This is the game that was made by friends at my recent birthday part, AT the party.  I spent maybe an hour or so on development time at best.  Yeah, it's rough, but some people like it that way.</p><p>Game design shoutouts go to Stacey, Kandis, and Tim.  Thanks for helping out with your ideas, sprites, and voices.  Also thanks to Cara, Emily, and Christine for sending in ideas from far away.  GABE AND MELINDA, big shout out to you for sending in amazing assets that we haven't incorporated YET.  Soon, friends... soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/444f5d14b91e531eceed00a8c85e4a10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jenothy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
