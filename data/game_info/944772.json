In this game, you will spend a day as a social phobic. It's just an ordinary day, but as a social phobic, every daily activity seems extraordinarily torturous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is what a social phobic has to say about themselves.\u00a0Every night, I keep looking at electronic devices very late, because the internet is my only haven, where I need to catch my breath every night, to watch videos, see comics and read novels.\u00a0Only by entering the virtual world could I temporarily release my fear of the real world.\u00a0In the morning, I struggle to get out of bed and make the mental preparations needed to suppress my fears before heading out the door. The crowds on the street look like monsters and I am afraid to meet their eyes. In class, I am very uneasy, constantly worried that the teacher will call me up to answer a question and praying internally that she won't notice me. Even in restaurants, I am afraid to talk to the waiter/waitress and order. I'm even more afraid to ask the waiter/waitress not to put food I don't like. My life is really tiring...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Input: Keyboard and Mouse\r\n</p>\n<p>Use \"W,A,S,D\" to control the character forward, left, backward and right.
