The theme was a choice between\u00a0Unorthodox Solutions and Illegal Actions, but I decided to combine them.</p>\n<p>You just robbed a bank. As you approach the exit with your riches, you encounter some unfriendly security guards. Obviously, you were expecting this to happen--which is why\u00a0you brought, against common decency,\u00a0a rocket launcher with you.</p>\n<p>It's good at, uh, killing people, but there's a catch: every time the missiles explode, they leave behind a patch of fire that kills you if you step in it. Kill as many guards as possible as the space you have in the room shrinks, and don't get caught by the guards!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD or arrow keys to move<br/>Move the crosshair with your mouse and click to shoot</p><p>Art by me<br/>Sound effects from freesound.org<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Siren:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/onderwish/sounds/470504/</li><li>Explosion:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/sounds/478272/</li></ul>\n<p>Good luck...
