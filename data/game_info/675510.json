You can do this just by bumping into them. Be careful though! This technique is likely to send you flying too! Also beware of standing idle for too long, as these platforms are old, and unstable. They could collapse at any moment if you stand on them!</p>\n<p>Your fight will take you from great <em>Sakura Forests</em>, to the <em>Rooftops of Kyoto</em>, and even <em>deep into the mountains</em> - as you and your friends wreak havoc across <strong><em>9 stages</em></strong>!</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>9 Stages</li><li>Keyboard &amp; Controller Support</li><li>2 Players on 1 Keyboard</li><li>A Custom Soundtrack</li></ul>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Keyboard A:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0A/D -&gt; Move</li><li>\u00a0Space -&gt; Jump</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard B:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Left/Right -&gt; Move</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0L.
