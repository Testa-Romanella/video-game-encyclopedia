I made this game using RPG maker, It's an oldschool turn based RPG game, fans of Dragon Quest and old Final Fantasy games will hopefully like it.\u00a0The duration is about 20 hours.\u00a0If you find any bugs, please report back to me and I'll fix them. You can download it for free, and if you're kind enough you can donate any amount you wish. That will help me to make another game, because it took me a loooong of time to finish this. Thanks again and I\u00a0hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c907ca63aa4c56dfaf8776861a402575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iliasofsuburbia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
