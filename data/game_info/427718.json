Players will explore the eastern dark world, seeking the astonishing truth behind the unspeakable mysterious events.<br/><br/><br/>Dark Souls series (include Bloodborne and Sekiro) are always our studio's favorite, and developing our own soul-like game has been our target since the studio established. Every single player has his/her own understanding about what the most \"soul-like\" factors are in games, and our game, Unformed is the our studio's first answer sheet. Perhaps there would be no fancy special effects nor eye-dizzying battles, but we do hope players could experience the tesion of exploring dangerous stages and the accomplishment of beating invincible enemies just like they did in Dark Souls series, and enjoy our spooky eastern myths story.<br/><br/><br/>Our game, Unformed is still in early access stage. In the next one year and a half we will keep polishing the current existing content and publishing new content such as stages / enemies / stories etc. Also we will communicate with players on Steam about our developing plan. If any bugs / mistakes happen in our game, please let us know by leaving comment on Steam, we will react as fast as we can.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T07:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a16684ea73b0d6cee09f7f60ad26870f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bones"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cimugames"], "esrb_rating": null}
