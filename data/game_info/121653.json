{"id": 121653, "slug": "applefox", "name": "AppleFox", "name_original": "AppleFox", "description": "<p>\"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\"</p><p>This quote by famous scientist Isaac Newton was directed towards fellow scientist Robert Hooke insulting his unfortunate physical build. Being as the theme was 'Standing on the shoulders of giants', it seemed fitting to use the original quote as a basis for our game. We took inspiration from both Newton and Hooke and decided that a catapult seemed to encompass both Newton's Laws of Motion and Hooke's Law on the extension of springs. Finally we decided that using apples as the ammunition for the catapult seemed to perfectly fit the iconic story of Newton's discovery of gravity, when an apple allegedly landed on his head as he studied underneath a tree.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/6618c449305860746b9507fbd7d0f5cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unrealsevenfold"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
