So after another day of work, it's your job to help him go through his evening and finally go to bed. Easy, right?<br/></p>\n<p>Overall the gameplay is frustrating and repetitive, with a VERY silly tone to it. Don't play if you're not in the mood for laughs and if you plan on taking this game seriously.</p>\n<p>In the end, if everything is done right, it will take around 10-20 minutes to beat.
