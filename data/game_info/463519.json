Earth retaliates by engaging a force field to keep the pink alien out of bay. Unfortunately the mother ship has other ideas. It beams out little aliens through the force field. The world leaders have called in for you to help. The cities are under threat of being destroyed.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You control a fighter jet, which has to put a stop to this chaos. Fight wave after wave blasting at the aliens as they start to approach the ground surface. Try to defend the city building. Beware, if you collide in to an alien, a life will be lost. Also watch out for the mother ship above. Not only will it beam out more aliens. It will also attempt to fire its laser. At the end of the day you don't really want to end up being Zzapped in the Butt, do you?<strong><br/><br/>Credits:<br/></strong>Programming, graphics and sound effects by <strong>Richard Bayliss</strong> using CBMPRGStudio<br/>Tape loader system by <strong>DoSoft</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T05:19:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d53563cc79eb7acfee9eadda4ed239c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
