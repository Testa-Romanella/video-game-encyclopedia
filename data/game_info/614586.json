You are a scavenger tasked with looting all the treasures that the heroes have left in a dungeon after defeating all the monsters. You will use all of your different abilities to disrupt other goblins and use your intelligence to gain the upper hand, after some time you will need to use a portal to leave the dungeon before the heroes return, be greedy but be careful as well, not everything that glistens is gold.</p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>You must travel through the labyrinth finding treasures. Try to get as many as you can. But... be careful not to be too greedy, because you have a weight limit which you can carry and sometimes \"not everything that glistens is gold\". Also, there's a timer and you must escape the labyrinth before it ends or else you'll die. To escape, you need to open the portal at the center, but be wary that once activated by someone you will only have 2 minutes to escape. At the end of the game the winner will be decided depending on the value of their objects. Choose well and have fun with your friends.</p>\r\nControls (Sorry, we didn't have time for tutorial D:)\r\n<ul><li>Move your goblin with <strong>WASD<br/></strong></li><li>Jump around <strong>Spacebar</strong></li><li>Rotate the camera <strong>moving your cursor</strong></li><li>Grab nearby objects with <strong>right click</strong></li><li>Throw a stone at your enemy with <strong>left click</strong> to stun him and steal his loot</li><li>Create a false Item that has no value to\u00a0 deceive your enemies with <strong>F</strong></li><li>Run as fast as you can holding <strong>Shift</strong></li><li>Run even faster for a short period of time with <strong>R</strong></li><li>Interact with the world with <strong>E<br/></strong></li><li>Open your inventory with\u00a0<strong>I</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:51:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/507fecdc6694a3ef08d65faeea975d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CluelessStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
