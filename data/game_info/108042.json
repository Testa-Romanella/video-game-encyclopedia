You have to fight waves of monster while collecting new cards for your deck.</p>\n<ul><li>40 unique cards</li><li>9 different monsters each with their own unique deck cards.</li><li>15 monster waves (if you beats them all you will loop on the last 3 ones).</li></ul>\n<p>No sounds, no music, and the interface lacks feedbacks. I didn't have the time in 48h (it was quite a complex game to code).</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>You have 3 Actions points (AP).</li><li>Each card cost 1 to 3 AP. Click on a card to play it. If it don't works, it's because it does not have a valid target, or you dont have the required AP.</li><li>The card \"focus\" in the bottom right corner is a special one. You can always play it, it won't be discarded. Use it to refill your hand when you don't have anything usefull to do.</li><li>Other cars go to the discard pile and are shuffled back to your deck when there is no cards left in it.</li><li>Some special cards like potion are single use.</li><li>When you kill an ennemy, a chest may appears. You can loot a card by clicking it. But something it's not good to add a bad card to your deck, choose wisely!</li><li>Some cards allow you to remove cards from your deck.</li><li>Rare and legendary cards are very powerfull. You will recognize them by their different color (blue for rare, orange for legendary).</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f9aef2744288ff0b411ee2f6c53190e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThetaTauTau"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
