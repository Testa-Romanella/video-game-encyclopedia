You have been abducted along with a girl who is supposed to be your protegee. At the enemy king's castle, after days of captivity, your superiors have arrived for a negotiation. See what happens after.</p>\n<p>The game was meant to be an otome where you can date Selios, Deous, and Minos (on compulsory order). I have finished most of the script, but the story became too long to be made into one game. Now I plan to release Selios's path first as a full game. This demo version contains the first 10 days of this path.</p>\n\n<p>You can walk around the castle. There will be an event every day.</p>\n<p>Your choices during the events affect your 'progress'.</p>\n<p>After you have triggered the event of the day, you can go to sleep in your bedroom to proceed.</p>\n<p>There are minor events around the map. In some cases, they affect your 'progress' too.\u00a0\u00a0Currently available minor events: Provisions (a shady acquaintance); A Night of Illusions; dreams (unfinished); random dialogues in many locations.</p>\n<p>The game ends on Day 31 (the demo version includes days 1-10). The progress determines your ending. There are two endings for Selios's path.</p>\n<p>As days go on and you accumulate progress during the game,\u00a0random dialogues will change.</p>\n\n<p>Credits: See 'About' menu. I'll write a complete acknowledgement in the full version. :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T20:47:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92b287b81cc8dbcbcac8e8cfa7ebe099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["LightyOle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
