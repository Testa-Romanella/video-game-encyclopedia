Any similarity is purely coincidental.<br/>\r\nIn the 77 years of the meta-universe, 77% of the world's population is active in 114,514 disparate virtual communities. Our story takes place in one of the 114514 \"Vega\" communities.<br/>\r\nIn Vega, the public morality is very different from the first year of the cosmic calendar (2021), and the two most prominent points are universal faith.<br/>\r\nIn the first year of the meta-universe, everyone is ordinary, but it is ordinary people who make great achievements with ordinary people that make glimmers of light converge into a river of stars, creating a miracle. Confidence, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful qualities of a human being. Confident people have an aura about them and seem to have everything under control.<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, in the \"Vega\" community of 77 years in the meta-universe, the word \"universal faith\" has become a criticism and accusation. It seems that everyone, no matter men or women, old or young, should not be an ordinary person, let alone be ordinary and keep a confident heart.<br/>\r\nNow, in the year 77 of the metacosmic calendar, if you are a \"universal male\" like me, but have entered the \"Vega\" community, I can only hope that you can keep yourself, do not lose this valuable quality.<br/>\r\nIn Vega, you will encounter all kinds of events that are not in keeping with contemporary morality. Here are two options for you to choose from. For example, if you approve of stealing, snooping, or bullying, you will lose your goodness, and if you do not, you will become more virtuous. If you completely lose the goodness, will become the vast masses of \"vega\", and if you are too kind, so \"Vega\" is not able to accommodate you.<br/>\r\nThere's a lot of funny stuff going on here, too, so gloat or take it seriously is up to you. It's worth noting that most of vega's people are schadenfreude funniers.<br/>\r\nOn top of that, just like everyone else in the meta-universe, you'll have to work overtime, work overtime, and even be lucky when \"the biggest and worst incident in the history of the meta-universe -- your balls running away from your apartment.\"<br/>\r\nThe good news is, there's always luck in the universe, and there's always a chance you'll get a girlfriend.<br/>\r\nThere are 8 endings and many achievements waiting to be unlocked.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T02:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f1/9f151abb1eae90f95cf147e89be3de9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u7ec7\u5973\u661f\u6e38\u620f"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u7ec7\u5973\u661f\u6e38\u620f"], "esrb_rating": null}
