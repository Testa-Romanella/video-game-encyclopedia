It was made as a side project when another game I was working on turned into a larger beast than I had planned for a first release. I set a limit of 4 days for it, but 4 days turned into 7, and this is the result. As a result this is mostly a core or prototype to build on, and I'd like to continue building on it. I did spend a large chunk of that time to polish and bug hunt though, so it's a playable prototype. I'll also be seeking an artist, so if your a pixelartist, please send me a link to your stuff. It will be a free project, but if this game gets some traction I'd like to expand it into a game I could put up for sell, and expand this hobby into a career. </p><p>I hope you'll try it and enjoy a classic couch battle between friends with this game. If you'd like to give feedback or criticism, I'm always open to it, as I want to get better at this. </p><p>I'd like to thank Justin Howard (@jhow1138 -twitter) for the music. He took an idea, and produced great results. </p><p>Also, thanks to Yoyo Games and the Game Maker community. I would still be stuck with ideas flying around in my head and no way to make them without this program and community. </p><p>Contact and follow me on twitter @ethanhdgs or email me at oddcatgames@gmail.com.</p><p>Thanks for at least making it all the way to the end of the description, and download my game so you didn't waste time reading it.   :D</p><p>-Ethan Hodges<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4caff8ef0f6b010dfb10aafca3163e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddCat"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
