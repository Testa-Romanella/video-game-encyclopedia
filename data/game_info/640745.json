On the way to the planet, you see four different things; an astronaut, a snowman, a fox and a turtle. Because you have seen these creatures, you are now able to morph into them (each creature having its own pros and cons to surviving certain environmental hazards). You must\u00a0<strong><em>adapt</em></strong> to survive whatever obstacle is thrown at you!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W -up</p>\n<p>A - left</p>\n<p>D - right</p>\n<p>S - down</p>\n<p>Space Bar - Jump</p>\n<p>U - fox\u00a0</p>\n<p>I - turtle\u00a0</p>\n<p>O - snowman\u00a0</p>\n<p>P - astronaut\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nFire kills everyone!\r\n<p>Fox - most versatile but\u00a0dies to everything</p>\n<p>Turtle - slow on land but quick in the water</p>\n<p>Snowman - slippery, and immune to cold snaps</p>\n<p>Astronaut - no gravity and is immune to disease</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Artist\u00a0 and Game Design -\u00a0James Collins</p>\n<p>Artist,\u00a0 Animator and Game Design\u00a0- Samantha Lindsey</p>\n<p>Tech - Bryn McKerracher</p>\n<p>Tech Artist -\u00a0Andrew Savey</p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0Sqriations<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea78e1fe2a558b98801392267ea17b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IndieDevAndy", "Technical Games", "Bryn", "sammiewammie"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
