The theme for the jam is \"Opposites Attract.\"\u00a0 I never knew Xanderwood was such a huge Paula Abdul fan either. To implement this theme, I made it so that enemies that are not the same color as you are hostile towards you. You color changes randomly while playing.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>A and D to turn left and right. That's it!</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>Your character automatically shoots are randomly chosen enemies. The character also moves forward at all times. Your job is to dodge enemies and their projectiles. As enemies are destroyed, health globs and bombs are dropped for you to collect. Collect the bombs strategically to destroy large hordes of enemies. As the game progresses the difficulty ramps up. If you reach level 10 you'll be doing pretty good. But beware, things quickly become a little insane at level 10. How long can you survive level 10?</p>\n<p>I made this game in Construct 3. Music was made in FLStudio20. SFX were made with SFXR, Please rate and comment and I will do the same for you. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95adf9ea003db80e9f1275ac2d6cc9cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
