There is no end to that battle, but you can still try to get a decent highscore!</p>\n<p><strong>I dare you to beat my highscore of 178 seconds.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Download the game for better performance and audio quality!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Player 1</strong></p>\n<p>Move with \"A\" or \"D\"</p>\n<p>Jump with \"W\"</p>\n<p>Kick with \"S\"</p>\n<p><strong>Player 2</strong></p>\n<p>Move with arrow keys</p>\n<p>Jump with up arrow key</p>\n<p>Kick with down arrow key</p>\n\n<p>This game was\u00a0<strong>made in about 7 days</strong>\u00a0for the <strong>MashUp</strong><strong>\u00a0Game Jam 2022.</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Randomized prompts:</strong></p>\n<p>Genre: Fighting</p>\n<p>Theme: Balance</p>\n<p>Setting: Sea</p>\n<p>Item: Water</p>\n\n<p>Programming, music and art were\u00a0<strong>made by myself during the jam.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>v1.1</p>\n\n<p><strong>Headphones recommended!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81d18ee973c2f2687baab3b7d2e3af8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Lenki387"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
