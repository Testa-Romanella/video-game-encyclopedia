Most of them are easy and teach you how to use the game. The final levels get harder. Nevertheless, it is not top hard too hard, as you can get thought the levels by trial and error. \r\n  </p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Place the connectors using the controls described below. If you successfully formed a line, that connects all fields, you will be notified to press any key so you can continue with the next levels.\r\n  </p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Use W, A, S, D to move the cursor.\u00a0</li><li>To choose the connector directly, you can use the keys: U, I, J, K for the circle segments and O, L for the straight lines.\r\n\u00a0</li><li>Alternatively, you can swap the currently selected connector with G and H. With space or return you can actually use the selected connector.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Logiker \u2026 Code, Gfx\u00a0<br/>Wil \u2026\u2026\u2026.
