I may revisit this for AI and networking development\u00a0later, and add single player and on-net multiplayer later, but no promises at this time, as this is just a toy project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T03:54:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1f98fb1d0adce8e741ae14f5d549673.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kris40k"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
