So I thought 'why not make my own, and put it online for free.' And so I did!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm well aware there are dozens of minesweeper clones around, and mine (get it) isn't particularly unique (although you can change the colours a little). The project was made simply so you could enjoy playing minesweeper on the computer without the internet and without annoying ads. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S. there is currently no custom mode, it\u00a0might\u00a0be added in the future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33f/33f19d3425a2927e6b19cd4ab62e3be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koomplr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
