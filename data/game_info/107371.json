{"id": 107371, "slug": "voyage-to-the-final-lands", "name": "Voyage to the Final Lands", "name_original": "Voyage to the Final Lands", "description": "<p>\"Voyage to the Final Lands\" is a fantasy adventure game heavily inspired by the Legend of Zelda series. It was made in under 72 hours for the\u00a0Gamemaker Community Jam #4, according to the theme of \"Voyage\". We won Best Use of Theme and 7th place among 43 entries.</p>\n<p>Sail from island to island in a quest to find the Final\u00a0Lands, a legendary land where only the bravest of adventurers can live. Follow in the footsteps of countless other adventurers who died, and hope you don't do the same. Sail through 5 islands filled with hidden treasure, dangerous monsters and tricky puzzles. There are three main items, a final boss and countless optional treasure to find.</p>\n<p>The official jam version is available for download here. If there is interest, I will release one more version where I fix the game-breaking bugs, make combat more interesting, update a few of the sprites and add a little bit more content on some of the more shallow islands.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: Cloaked\u00a0Games</li><li>Art: HayManMarc and\u00a0Cloaked Games</li><li>Sounds: Joseph Benedetti</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>\"Galway\", \"Doobly Doo\", \"Interloper\", \"Frozen Star\", and \"Full On\"<br/>by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Type 7r Spritefont:<br/>Chrisblue (CC BY-SA 3.0) Modified by us.<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96ba2a6355b2a09cbde2e7f1b87d90e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cloaked Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
