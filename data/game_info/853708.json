Made in one week for ACM Game-Dev fall 2022 Jam with the theme \"gravity\". Discover what it's like to be \"Yo Mama\" You know... the one from all the jokes? Due to unfortunate time constraints(cough cough statics homework), yo mama is not so fat that she has her own gravitational field, but yo mama <em>is</em> so ugly, she makes onions cry. But it's still gravity themed, I swear! look at all the almost floating onions!\u00a0 Concept, code &amp; animations - Ryan Baas(me), Music - our very own Jorge Cantu!
