To do so, you\u2019ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations\u2026 as well as threats within your own court.</p>\n<p>Customize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.</p>\n<p>Meet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You\u2019ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you\u2019ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.</p>\n<p>Conquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins \u2014 and while dealing with politics in your own court.</p>\n<p>Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favor\u2014and to test your strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Explore - Conquer - Rule!</strong></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world&#39;s oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you.
