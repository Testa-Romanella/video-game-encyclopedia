Players control a platform that floats upward. They\u00a0move\u00a0left and right to collect falling shapes and weigh down their platform in a race to the bottom of the level. Terrain and obstacles need to be navigated, as well as managing the stack of collected shapes so they don\u2019t collapse and fall off. It\u2019s an exciting, dynamic and chaotic game to play with friends!</p>\n<p>This game is a continuation of a Certificate III Game Design course project at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment. Many updates are still planned, but we are publishing the game on Itch at this time to gather feedback.\r\n </p>\n<p>Many thanks to the AIE, Sean Fenemore, Alex Jansons, Yoon Jin Park and Team 1.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T18:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d0d945fa91dd78dcb5043ce76461120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["emipvg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
