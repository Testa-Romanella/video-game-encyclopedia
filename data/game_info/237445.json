There are three variations you can play.<br/><br/>Totally free. No in-app purchases.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt into 12 piles of 4. The objective is to move them all onto the suit piles (foundation). You can only move the top card of each pile and piles can be built down in suit.<br/><br/>When you have no moves tap \"Re-Pile\". It is important to know that \"Re-Pile\" does not shuffle the cards. It only redistributes them back into piles of four.<br/><br/>CRUEL - The classic game.<br/>SAVAGE - You can build piles in mixed suits but there are no re-piles.<br/>BRUTAL - A very difficult game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:16:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f3569a03e7e7d51bac6b72c1846b33b.jpg", "website": "http://mmpapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MmpApps"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["MmpApps"], "esrb_rating": null}
