{"id": 17252, "slug": "deadlight", "name": "Deadlight", "name_original": "Deadlight", "description": "<p>Deadlight is a side-scrolling survival platformer with horror elements set in a post-apocalyptic 2.5D environment of Seattle. The game follows a former park ranger Randall Wayne, who tries to get to a safe zone located in the city, where he hopes his family will be waiting for him. Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination. On his way, Randall, in control of players, should avoid both zombies and members of self-proclaimed local authority gang called New Law. The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall\u2019s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2012-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T07:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/595/59556e1839b2e79b6f11f2c68a197663.jpg", "website": "http://www.deadlightgame.com", "rating": 3.63, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 167, "owned": 3292, "beaten": 428, "toplay": 69, "dropped": 135, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 541, "suggestions_count": 537, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 548, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Tequila Works"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
