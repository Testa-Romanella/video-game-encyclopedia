Breathe deeply, and the lizard will float gently across the desert. Take lots of quick breaths and you will plummet back down to earth. Don't go too fast or too slow, or your lizard friend might get dizzy.\u00a0I hope you have a good time!</p>\n<p>Controls: Hold \"Space\" to breathe in, let go to breathe out. Press \"R\" to reset the game.</p>\n<p>NOTE: DO NOT try to match your breathing to the game. You will probably hyperventilate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bb/4bb32d48f9492ba9bbb140cbb9d9b1c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["InTheLibrary"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
