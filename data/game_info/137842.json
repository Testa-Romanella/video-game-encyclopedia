There's an old saying in her city that warns people about an abandoned house inside the town's forest. Rumour has it that the place is haunted by ghosts and spirits, and if someone tries to enter the mansion, they may never get out. But L\u00facia doesn't buy that idea. She is a smart girl, and knows better. One day, she decides to see for herself. Now, she's locked inside the old mansion! And guess what! The ghosts are chasing her! Help Lucia run from the ghosts, in which seems to be an infinite-storey building! Hurry up! They are almost reaching her!</p><p>A game by\u00a0Luiza Figueiredo and Thiago Torres</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9acd041602f5f4f7acb1c43d6abbd36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Membrana"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
