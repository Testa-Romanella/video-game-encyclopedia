{"id": 197427, "slug": "vampyro", "name": "VamPyro", "name_original": "VamPyro", "description": "<p><strong>VamPyro</strong> is my own <strong>Unity 5</strong> creation, fully scripted in C# and using a set of free assets for character models, animations and pathfinding (see below for links). Each level, as well as the number and placement of enemies and blue health pick-ups, is created procedurally. The game can be controlled either with <strong>keyboard and mouse</strong> or with a <strong>Sony DualShock 4</strong> controller.<br/><br/>In <strong>VamPyro</strong>, the player is tasked with <strong>escaping </strong><strong>procedural mazes</strong> which increase in size and difficulty with each beaten level. The only offensive weapon against the maze's enemy population is a <strong>flame</strong> <strong>which draws from the player's</strong> <strong>health</strong>. When<strong> l</strong><strong>ower health means higher movement speed</strong>, it is up to the player to manage these variables by using more of the flame or picking up <strong>blue cells to replenish weapon fuel and health</strong>. <strong>Enemies can catch fire</strong> from coming into contact with either the player's flame or another burning enemy. <strong>Once on fire, enemies move faster</strong> than usual for the last seconds before they die, posing an additional threat to the player. Beating each level is either achieved by retrieving <strong>yellow keys</strong> from defeated enemies and then <strong>escaping the maze</strong> through the opened exits or by <strong>burning every last enemy to the ground</strong>.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p><ul><li><strong>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</strong>: <ul><li>Move with WASD</li><li>Aim by pointing the mouse</li><li>Shoot by clicking the left mouse button</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>DualShock 4</strong>: <ul><li>Move with the left joystick</li><li>Aim with the right joystick</li><li>Shoot with R1</li></ul></li></ul><p>Player Assets</p><p>Enemy Assets</p><p>Pathfinding</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29d27eb03f2cd6ab77da976409d13fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["meytophe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
