You have to deliver a very important letter to the king ! He is the boss and only he is capable to stop the apocalypse ! You have 60 seconds to succeed in your mission. Will you be able to save the world ?</p>\n<p>This game was posted for the 2021 VimJam in September and was the second ever game jam that I took part in. Each participant had 10 days to create a game that fitted the theme \"<em>On the edge</em>\" and the restriction \"<em>Boss</em>\". In my game the world is\u00a0<strong>on the edge\u00a0</strong>of collapse and the player has to deliver a letter to the king (i.e.\u00a0<strong>the boss</strong> of the lands) to save the world.<br/></p>\n<p>All art &amp; audio created by me during the jam.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this game, please send in a comment. Reading feedback and your experiences seriously brings me a lot of\u00a0happiness.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the biggest lessons I've learnt during this jam :<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Desining levels for a platformer is amusing</li><li>Creating assets (both auditive and visual) is a lot of fun, even if it looks very amateur. Here's the link to the beepbox song.\u00a0</li><li>Paint dot net's noise function really gives a lot of depth to images</li><li>It is important to fix a resolution <em>before</em> starting the project, otherwise you get unpleasant results (such as my first game jam entry)</li><li>Being able to conceive games and getting inspiration from everywhere is a really pleasant feeling.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4eb6ade888a23cbd983fa284fe231500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VicoPTP"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
