Now some people known as Alien-Agents have found that you are roaming on the earth, so they are in search for you. When your spaceship was crashed it's important parts were scattered all around the Wellspring town. Now you have to find\u00a0\u00a0and collect\u00a0all the three parts (Engine, Exhaust and the Key) &amp; take each one of them to the spaceship (one by one) in order\u00a0to repair your spaceship and go back home. But the twist is that you can't breathe the air on earth for a long time, so you have to possess or control the souls of humans roaming in the town (Special ability) in order to survive, But you can't control a human for more than 15 seconds i.e. If you you control a same human for 15 seconds he will become mad and make chaos throughout the game. You have to switch between the humans throughout the game and beware of the Agents roaming around the city trying to catch you, they will not recognize you when you are a human so try to be a human in front of them! So \"Let There be Chaos\" but you have to go back home!\r\n\n\n<strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong>\n<ul><li><strong>Use Arrow Keys or w, a, s, d keys to move around in the world.</strong></li><li><strong>Press space-bar to possess an NPC when near.</strong></li><li><strong>Press Q to leave possession from a NPC.</strong></li></ul>\n\r\nCREDITS\r\nLead Programmer - Reshi.\u00a0\r\nLead Game Designer - Snow|Brugon and Infiniverse.\r\nLead Musician - Olandersone (bombasonido@gmail.com).\u00a0\r\nLead SFX Designer - Herno (bombasonido@gmail.com).\u00a0\r\nLead 3D Artist - NE0.\u00a0\r\nCo-3D Artist - Sir Flippers\u00a0\r\nCo - Programmer - Infiniverse.\u00a0\r\nLevel Designer - Infiniverse.\r\n\r\nPREMADE ASSETS USED -\u00a0\r\nSimple Toon Town Assets -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/simple-town-cartoon-...\r\n\n<p><strong>THANKS!</strong></p>\r\nIMPORTANT -<br/><strong>The Game\u00a0 is BROKEN because we ran out of time, Sadly,\u00a0 but we update it soon please stay tuned.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T18:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e9c3f441ec1890cb71a53a45c048ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Infiniverse Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
