It is the first sequel to The Bard&#39;s Tale, and the last game of the series that was designed and programmed by Michael Cranford.</p>\n<p>The game features Dungeons and Dragons-style characters and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, The Bard&#39;s Tale, also created by Michael Cranford. The Bard&#39;s Tale II takes place on a larger scale with an explorable wilderness, six cities, and multiple dungeons which give this game its dungeon crawl character. The game has new features such as casinos and banks, and introduces a new magic user called an Archmage, among other changes from the first game in the series.</p>\n<p>The game became somewhat infamous for its very high difficulty level. Cranford acknowledged this in interviews, stating that it may not have been playtested enough and that while he wanted to make a challenging game, he did not realize just how difficult it was to complete the quest.</p>\n<p>Although it received mixed reviews upon release, The Bard&#39;s Tale II won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1986.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1986-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/042/0429fe43399bafa66a8a8f7e76267b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.17, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 9, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "Apple II", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Interplay Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
