{"id": 615077, "slug": "fractal-block-world", "name": "Fractal Block World", "name_original": "Fractal Block World", "description": "This is a surreal exploration game.  You move through the world by flying.  A key aspect of the way exploration works is there are locations where you can shrink or get larger.  You can easily shrink 100 times to become extremely small.  You start the game in a forest area where you can shrink to explore the trees.  Once you figure out how to leave this place, the world opens up into many procedurally generated interconnected areas.  Where to go is up to you, and there are many trophies and much gold you can collect throughout the world.  But your main quest is to rescue your friend by finding an Inner Core.  This requires finding the path that leads deep into inner space.  Along the way you will encounter mazes and scavenger hunts.  You will want a pencil and paper to map out the world.  In a future release, we will add a second optional mode to this game with monsters and weapons (still during the early access period). The final release should be spring of 2022.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T03:52:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/289318147fc4c56a615bffaaf2a7a7f5.jpg", "website": "http://danthemanhathaway.com/ComputerGames/FractalBlockWorld/ReleaseMisc/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Hathaway"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fractal Block Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
