As for Beastboy, well, I love gorillas and I love green, so yeah, xD<br />\nThis mini game was originally made for the Strawberry Game Jam 3 and nearly all content was made by yours truly, from the art, to the animation, to the coding and more.\u00a0The only aspects I didn&#39;t make were the background music and the announcer voice at the start of the game.<br />\nThis was also partially a personel challenge of trying to get a game done(regardless how small) within a week with a heavy work schedule of which i&#39;m happy to say I managed to complete, :D!<br />\nEnjoy, :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-24T11:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5a9/5a9c7a1e594c3fd3b0eca7d3c6f592ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Sanctioned13"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
