The player is given 3 lives and\u00a0controls a paddle with the mouse.</p>\n<p>Design challenges were that i needed to figure out how to simulate how the ball plays out in breakout. I did this by using the physics behavior in construct 2 to have the ball to bounce out surfaces. I also had difficulties in which the ball would sometimes get stuck and so i create a button that allows that player to re-center the ball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/336/336674000ffc5f34b4485a1b68e7aba9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alexander_matos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
