It was fun making a game under an hour, it was extremely challenging. Knowing that your time is limited. I managed to finish the game for an hour and twenty minutes, 8 minutes for the art and the rest is programming and testing. I'm quite disappointed since I didn't made it in time. My computer freezes once in a while and runs very slowly as the anti virus runs a full scan in background. Though, I'm still really proud that I made a game in a short period of time.</p><p>\r\n\tGame created with Game Maker Studio<br/>Sounds created with bfxr.net</p>Controls<ul>\n<li>W - Move Up</li>\n<li>A - Move Left</li>\n<li>S - Move Down</li>\n<li>D - Move Right</li>\n<li>Mouse - Aim</li>\n<li>Left Mouse Button - Shoot</li>\n<li>Esc - Restart</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Socials</strong>\n<ul><li>Follow us on Twitter @DAInteractives</li><li>Like us on Facebook: @DAInteractives</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd9806363d8f624b029dc5ca19287582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["High Leap Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
