This was a great experience and provided some forced education for sure! We're already looking forward to the next one. We both realize this isn't exactly a home run, but at least it got completed enough to submit. Thanks for putting this Game Jam on!</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Out of Control\"\u00a0and this was our take on it given our limited skillset.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc664fb2768816b2e768291f25d3d847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cory.colt"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
