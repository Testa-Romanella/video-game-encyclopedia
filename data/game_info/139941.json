I made all the: art, code, music, writting &amp; testing. It's been in the drawer forever, and I considerit very personal, but it is a pitty that no one can see it so I want to share it for free with you guys, It is not a professional game but hopefully can entertain you for a couple minutes. If at least one person gets to enjoy this little adventure it would have been worth it so if you liked it please let me know :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f81928f709d998200537b123d2b4f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ManuScythe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
