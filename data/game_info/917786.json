The structure of the kingdom is feudal: the Duchies and the Marks are managed by their ruling Houses, many of which also have their representatives sitting at the Council, a governing body ruling in the name of the King located in Lybra, the capital city of the Kingdom. As the leader of the Council, all social classes will come asking for your help: Merchants, Scholars, the Army, the Cult of the Mother, and of course, the People. It will be your task to drive the choices of the Council and satisfy their requests\u2026 but you\u2019ll also have to manage the resources of the Kingdom, and keeping everyone happy won\u2019t be easy.<br/><br/>Your main interest is obviously to make Ankist prosper; however, you are also trying to increase the power and the prestige of your own family over the others. The campaign spans decades and generations, and you will assume the role of different representatives of your House over the course of the game.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T03:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/650/65029ef6256516845aabfe8a9bfdb35e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "toplay": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Big Trouble"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Big Trouble"], "esrb_rating": null}
