Minigames, there is nothing quite like being the last one standing in Bumper Balls or the first team making it out of the darkness in Dungeon Duos. All minigames are played with button controls, so you can stick to the Joy-Con\u2122 controller or bust out the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller or a Nintendo Switch Lite system.</p>\n<p>Party with superstars near or far</p>\n<p>Bring the party anytime, anywhere with same-system<strong>, local wireless</strong>, or online* play. Use stickers to praise or pester fellow players as you race across the board collecting stars.
