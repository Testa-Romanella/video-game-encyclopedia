{"id": 704993, "slug": "myproject-vanialviv", "name": "MyProject (Vanialviv)", "name_original": "MyProject (Vanialviv)", "description": "<p>This is my prototyped project that is inspired by the game Cataclysm DDA. I have envisioned it as a top-down, 2D, real-time survival/RPG.</p>\n<p>Right now some of the\u00a0features that have already been realized are:</p>\n<p>- The map generator that is using the Perlin Noise algorithm in order to generate a map. After that, it applies a different color to each pixel on the map that is based on the Noise.</p>\n<p>- The Chunk system is transforming each pixel from the map into a chunk that it later unloads if the player is far away from the chunk. Each chunk consists of\u00a024 by\u00a024 tilemap tiles. The chunks also have a system that randomly replaces some of the tiles with different sprite tiles(like flower tile of tall grass tile) in order to give more variety to the\u00a0procedural generation.</p>\n<p>- As for now,\u00a0the map has the 3 colors for the pixels to differentiate that type of the\u00a0chunk that needs to be loaded:\u00a0</p>\n<p>light green pixel for the plains chunk that consists of different grass tiles and a few trees</p>\n<p>dark green pixel for forest chunk that has a huge amount of trees</p>\n<p>brown pixel that generates only once on the map and is used to generate a chunk that has a custom wooden house.</p>\n<p>There is also a white pixel that represents the position of the player on the map.<br/></p>\n<p>You can open the map by pressing \"m\"(right now the map is blurry in the prototype due to a bag(in unity it works fine)).</p>\n<p>- Working player inventory with the ability to equip, drop, unequip, store and take items from storage. Inventory has a weight system that calculates the weight of all items. To open inventory you need to press \"i\".<br/></p>\n<p>- Items can be stackable and non-stackable,\u00a0\u00a0have different weights, some of them can be equipped and used by pressing \"LMB\"\u00a0while others are used as ammo or resources for building.</p>\n<p>- Storage system that allows you to store items in chests, carts, and bodies of zombies.</p>\n<p>- If you go down from the start position you will see enemy zombies that use A* algorithm in order to move and attack the player. When you kill them you can loot their bodies for items. They are using a loot table system in order to generate items from the pool in the storage of the body of the enemy.</p>\n<p>- Working apparel system that shows clothes on the player if equipped, some of the clothes can give different usability to the player(backpacks give the player additional\u00a0weight capacity and night goggles give infrared light at night).</p>\n<p>- Day/night cycle that was made with\u00a0Unity Lights 2D experimental system.\u00a0 Items like flashlights and matches are also using this system.</p>\n<p>- Working weapon system that\u00a0consists of a baseball bat, pistol,\u00a0automatic gun, shotgun, with a working ammo system for each gun and shooting mechanic.</p>\n<p> - Building system that allows building walls, floors, doors, and other buildings. Some of the buildings can be rotated before placement by pressing R. To open the building menu you need to press \"b\".</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/707e406b0b52822fd0fa50335e8e637f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vanialviv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
