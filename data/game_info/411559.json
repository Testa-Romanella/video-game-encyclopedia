{"id": 411559, "slug": "lightbreak-funyarinpa9", "name": "LIGHTBREAK (funyarinpa9)", "name_original": "LIGHTBREAK (funyarinpa9)", "description": "<p>LIGHTBREAK is a game about harmony. In the beginning of each level, a musical composition is presented, pure and whole, but is then broken, creating dissonance, confusion and chaos. It must be placed back together in order to repair and recreate harmony. In doing so, a new and improved \"extended\" version of the original harmony is played to celebrate this new order. The core gameplay fades as the player progresses through the game, and inevitably the game becomes about music creation. With no score system or timers, the game allows players to freely interact and create melodies, essentially providing a fun, relaxing experience (with the added challenge of completing the harmony).</p>\n<p>Created during Global Game Jam 2020 with the theme: REPAIR. Won the award for Best Game at Georgia State University.</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>GAME DESIGN<br/>Sam Mousavi</p>\n<p>PROGRAMMING<br/>Adam Schulz<br/>Sam Mousavi<br/>Hannah Wiser<br/>Josh Maxion</p>\n<p>UNITY DEVELOPERS<br/>Adam Schulz<br/>Sam Mousavi<br/>Hannah Wiser<br/>Josh Maxion</p>\n<p>ART STYLE<br/>Christina Pham<br/>Sam Mousavi</p>\n<p>ARTISTS<br/>Christina Pham<br/>Pascal Wilson</p>\n<p>ANIMATION<br/>Christina Pham<br/>Hannah Wiser</p>\n<p>AUDIO<br/>Seersha<br/>Isaac Ross</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d337efea5f933015d0a945e2a5bd81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["funyarinpa9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
