Take over a dystopian abandoned city. Each tile has obstacles to overcome through different means, and you will need to plan your forest ecosystems out like factories, where different buildings and units will help to strengthen your biome and destroy the surrounding devastated landscape.</p>\n<p><em>Gameplay notes:</em> Fly Traps remove any rusted cars or dumpsters around them, while the Wrecking Ball removes taller buildings. Use Bees to convert dirt tiles into fertile grass. Some trees have to be placed on water instead. Try to cover the entire map in greenery!</p><p><em>Any comments or feedback is greatly appreciated!
