The story is pretty lacking at the moment as we have yet to decide key plot devices and key points of interest to include in the story. There is some story, do not get us wrong, it is just... lacking in content. Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy what we have made so far.<br/><br/>From what we can tell, this game is rated E10+. There is some fantasy violence (fighting enemies), a bit of smoking and a bit of drinking. There even might be a mild swear or two.<br/><br/>This game is a constant work in progress. Mechanics and storylines are bound to change slightly in the future. The rating will more than likely change to a Teen rating. While the story is vague at the moment for the demo, more will be added to the beginning of the game and more will be revealed when you get further into the game.<br/><br/>This is a project that we have worked hard on together and are happy to share it with you all now. While nowhere near complete, we have decided to share the first portion of our game with you all... in the form of a demo. Please, check it out, critique as much as you can on what you can, all feedback is welcome and encouraged.<br/><br/>You cannot get better at something if you don't know what it is you are failing on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7e/c7e1796216ff8cee275768c6e0dc6e96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NinjaKittyProductions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
