This was an ambitious project from both the point of view of my skill level and the tech I was using. All created in timeline AS2! Check out it's features.</p>\n<ul><li>Day-night cycle</li><li>Tide (Went out at night allowing you to travel from island to island)</li><li>Fishing (Level up your fishing and catch bigger fish)</li><li>Hydration (Get hydro pouch then\u00a0water from the plants to drink)</li><li>Hunger (Catch and eat fish - use the desalinator first or you'll vomit)</li><li>Temperature (Get's too hot in the day, look for shade - will effect health)</li><li>Suit damage (Taken from crabsters (crab-lobsters))</li><li>Combat (Fight with crabsters that come out at night - need a bit of wood first)</li><li>Puzzle - Story to work out and advance the game - this was just a prologue</li><li>Torch / map / watch / inventory / data disks</li><li>Simple skill and quest system.</li><li>Indoor and outdoor environments.</li><li>Hand-drawn and animated sprites and backgrounds.</li></ul>\n<p>It was pretty advanced conceptually and quite\u00a0nuts, therefor\u00a0hard to categorize (Maybe survival with story?). SMH\u00a0that I tried this all with timeline and movieclips, I expect it is\u00a0probably more than a little buggy too. Now that browser Flash is officially dead, here's the exe, feel free to check out my grand ambitions! It really could have used a tutorial, sorry. Anyway, after this, never again, my next projects were using AS3 OOP, classes. MVC, the works.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b67/b6796654fa80e854e9abdedc7b6efeac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stu's Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
