There are a total of 15 level, 5 easy, 5 medium, 5 hard. Difficulty can be set in options on the main menu. And the paddle has a bit of control over the ball, ie: if the ball hits more to left side of the panel the ball will be nudged to left, this effect is increased the closer to the edge of the paddle and decreased the closer to the center.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbf7517f796d3e9b4bafd0d464d76d87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrainChicken"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
