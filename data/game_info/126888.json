Obstacles are cloned if the player collides with them, so the more players collide with obstacles, the harder it becomes to navigate the levels. Obstacles can also be cloned to solve physics-based puzzles.</p>\n<p>This game is mainly designed to be played with an Xbox controller. You may use keyboard and mouse, but it is not recommended.</p>\n<p>Developed by students at Westerdals Oslo ACT for a cross-platform design project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f80b81a948dd01e5f525aea2b03d3f94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lars Aass Olsen"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
