Added additional effect to enemy shooting ranged attack as an indication for the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 9/2/2021\r\n</strong>Added a new enemy type, tweaked some animations and effects and materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 22/2/2021\u00a0</strong>It's a bit confusing to update 2 different itch links but hopefully soon we'll combine them into one so it'll all make sense.<br/><strong>Update 23/2/21\u00a0</strong>Added some additional assets in the tutorial area. The overgrown foliage stands in front of the player and it needs to be cut before the player can progress.<br/>There were multiple improvements to the stamina system as well\u00a0(mostly bugfixes) and now the player can actually move while blocking with a reduced speed which gives the player more flexibility in battle.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update 25/2/21\u00a0</strong>We have introduced a system that hides objects that would obscure the player to make it easier to navigate around.<br/>Additionally a new area have been added to the end of the level which will be the gate that leads to the lift that takes the player into the mountain. This area features a dart trap that is meant to teach the player how to use roll and block (oh yeah, roll actually gives you some invincibility\u00a0 frames so that helps).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update 4/3/21\u00a0</strong> So quite a lot has changed since the last update. The system that hides objects in the player's view has been reworked so now it hides a separate top portion of the meshes depending on specific areas the players are. <br/>More assets such as destroyable crates, barrels(with some spicy particle effects), tree and bush variants has been added.<br/>The lift area has been populated with some fairly detailed assets and the lift itself.<br/>As this area is meant to serve as a tutorial area, we have popup messages along the road to indicate what skill the player should use at certain points. UI-wise it is still an early version of course.<br/>Overall we think we are getting close to finishing up this area so we can move onto other areas and the boss fight segment.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update 7/3/21\u00a0</strong>Finally added a pause menu (Escape key)\u00a0which is only used to access a debug teleport menu for now, there is also an exit button which might not work in webGL but it should be fine when it is played as an exe.<br/>We have started working on the transition part between scenes. This includes setting certain objects such as the player to DoNotDestroyOnLoad which preserves stats such as HP,\u00a0 stamina, souls and later on upgrades.<br/>It is possible to travel to the next scene now but it only really contains a bumpy lift ride and a flat plane with some funky stairs(ofc this will be another built out environment).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Update 9/3/21\u00a0</strong>So the last implementation of scene loading and retaining valuables turned out to be a hot mess after all... So we have put our heads together and found a better and simpler way of doing it using PlayerPref which is built into unity. So right now if you die in a certain scene, you *should* restart in the scene you died with with half of\u00a0 your souls and max HP while your current HP and souls carry over completely to the second scene after you activate the lever. After some testing it seems like this feature works on WebGL as well (we think it's using some sort of cookie in your browser) to store the \"save file\". So you can literally close the window, reopen it and you continue with how many souls you left off with.<br/>The second area has been updated with some new assets and a more expressive lift crash (to explain why you cant go back)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 11/3/21\u00a0</strong>We have finally figured out how to detect keyboard and controller input during runtime so the tutorial popups actually change according to input. Feel free to try to play\u00a0with controllers if it is possible.\u00a0<br/>The Descent area has been extended with a \"hidden\" tunnel leading to what it is going to be our hub house\u00a0with the NPC for upgrades.<br/><br/><strong>Update 24/3/21\u00a0</strong>The \"new\" safe house has been added and furnished compared to the last update. The glowing capsule upstairs is a placeholder for the Vendor/Upgrade NPC for later on.<br/>Most of the time (the last 8 days) were taken up by the boss who is mostly functional, however the arena is still just a placeholder of course. You can get to it by using the teleport cubes in the second area (placeholder until we implement rest/save spots).\u00a0Some additional animations such as\u00a0 stagger (when you cut her legs off...oh yeah you can do that!), and the intro animation still need to be added. It will also have multiple phases when it alternates between hanging from the ceiling (spitting ranged attacks) while smaller spiders are summoned. So basically the boss works, you can kill it but it's pretty hard as the player's stats are the starter stats as we do not have an upgrade system. We are still trying to figure out the best way to handle healing but a healing item will be a part of this of course (no wonder it's hard to beat the boss without it lol)<br/><br/><strong>Update 25/3/21\u00a0</strong>Minor update relating to the boss, it has the phases in-between the land phases now (30 secs of doing nothing for now) , this is when the spiderlings (Smaller Spiders)\u00a0\u00a0would be invading the player and in the second one (bellow 33%) is when the boss would also do a spit attack from above along with the spiderlings.<br/>Also the arena has been updated to an alpha level. Obviously it needs a lot of detail but this might be the size we are going for.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:38:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["viktorSitkei"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
