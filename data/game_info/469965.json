We are all teachers, and we wanted to mak a game that explores how your class management practice evolves as a new teacher. Players must interact with students in an attempt to maintain engagement, and improve their practice by making deeper connections with students. This is a prototype version, and there are so many more functions we would like to expand upon, but this was the best we could do in 5 days. We hope you enjoy our game and that you have an opportunity to reflect on what bad, good and great\u00a0teaching would look like!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6bb4119c7b3c08a8b6cbc7d7f20281e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stanford-smath"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
