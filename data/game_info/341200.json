This game was made in Unity.</p>\n<p>In the game you can choose how many letters(from the keyboard) you want the computer to say(No patterns, chosen randomly) from 1-15\u00a0, then you hear one letter after another and write them in the exact same order (one at a time).\u00a0\u00a0You need to confirm with Enter button. You get one letter wrong, you fail, so you need to get every letter correct.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The one thing i am mad - after you write the letter, you have to delete it manually(i tried many things, and didn't want to try with deleting and creating the input field in-game by scripting. I wanted to finish as quickly as i could after the 3h passed).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f9/3f967296f430c5f2cdb481e250bb9f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ciekawy Michu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
