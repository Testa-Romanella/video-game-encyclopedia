Not only does it feature good-looking models in exciting environments and situations, but it also offers a story element that you unlock by completing puzzles.<br />\nYou can do each puzzle in five different difficulties ranging from surprisingly easy to frustratingly impossible. People who seek a challenge can enjoy this game just as much as those that want to lay back and do some simple jigsaw puzzles.<br />\nThe game plays in and around a castle in a post-apocalyptic world. A long and brutal war left only a few strong men alive. Each settled down in their own part of the world. Those men quickly became the center point of small functioning societies comprised of the remaining females. A Familiar World tells the story of nine women, how they found each other, and how they eventually managed to flee their cruel reality.<br />\nThe story element of this game that can be unlocked by completing puzzles works as a Prologue of a visual novel, A Foreign World. The main story will talk about the struggles those nine women face in this new world they flee to. Can you help them?<br />\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2229110</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T11:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a9f/a9f8593a1f9b80c814cee5c37cbeab57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HighbornTiger"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["HighbornTiger"], "esrb_rating": null}
