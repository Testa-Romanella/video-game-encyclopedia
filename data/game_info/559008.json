Dagger: Chapter One", "description": "A noir first-person murder mystery set in a gloomy 1947 Pacific Northwest city. Play as the renowned Detective D.W. Dagger to help solve his latest case. A violent murder, a possible suicide, and a handful of suspects. <br/><br/><strong>Can you deduce what happened?</strong><br/><br/>----<br/><br/>As the first case in the upcoming series, test your deductive reasoning skills to piece together the truth of a new violent crime. <br/><br/>Taking inspiration from video games like \"Gone Home\" and \"What Remains of Edith Finch,\" as well as the board game classic \"Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective,\" you follow the narrative told through evidence found within the crime scene. As the lead detective, you must find suspects, determine which evidence helps your case and which hurts it, and ultimately, determine who committed the gruesome act. <br/><br/>This is a small, first case to give players an idea of what the larger series entails. It takes around 30-45 minutes to finish, depending on your detective skills! There is no randomized evidence or alternate paths, so once you complete it, that's it.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/><strong>Original Soundtrack by Corey Teply</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T02:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/1728ad7852e4ed9fc657c8e3faf1d4c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Lime Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Team Lime Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
