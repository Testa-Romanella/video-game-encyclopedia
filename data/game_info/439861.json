This is my first itch.io release, obviously I'm not very experienced\u00a0so please leave comment and feedback!\ud83d\ude03 I'll mainly be releasing for macOS, but windows should also come soon when it's optimised. Please support me by donating if you can!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a fruit-ninja-like game, where you click-and-drag your cursor to pop .... stuff. That's not it, you have 5 or 3\u00a0lives depending on the difficulty you choose, and you lose one whenever you miss a GOOD target or pop a BAD target. The instruction is also in the in-game UI,\u00a0HAVE FUN!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8c/f8cdaa55761db0704032890b5c5d58bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["MarvinX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
