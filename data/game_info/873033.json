As a 2D illustrator my biggest struggle was the coding and particle implementation, but I was already familiar with level design and asset creation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\r\nTasks done to create the game:<ul><li>Illustrated a tile sheet that I painted within Unity, and added proper collisions to</li><li>Illustrated 2D game assets that I implemented into the Unity scene (and added proper collisions to)</li><li>Created a player controller that had a camera tracked to the WASD movement of the player</li><li>Illustrated \"bees\" to become a particle that I set up in Unity</li><li>Created a timer using a font downloaded from the Unity Asset Library</li><li>Created a slow down effect when colliding with the \"honey\" asset I drew, along with nullifying that effect when colliding with the \"water bucket\" asset I drew</li><li>Created a win condition and screen when colliding with your \"friend\" at the end of the maze</li><li>Created a lose condition and screen when the time is at 10 seconds and you have not reached your friend</li><li>Created the ability to restart the game when finished playing, and exit the game whenever preferred</li><li>Implemented sound effects and background music from open game art</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T05:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f96747419cf5f52da6d9d636c3baf179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["short9960"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
