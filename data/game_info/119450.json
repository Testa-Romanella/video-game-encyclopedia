You have to manage the tug-of-war battle between the\u00a0light and dark energy that powers your weapons. You have a rapid fire light magic shot and a dark magic spread shot. Using your light magic makes your dark magic stronger and your light magic weaker, and vice versa. Juggle this with running around collecting power-ups and dodging attacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art and UI are placeholder. Any feedback on difficulty, fun, or bugs would be appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a0/0a0cf4549388d3f29516ce8d54b6dc1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ultra Runaway Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
