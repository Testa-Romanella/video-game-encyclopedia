Involved in the death of a childhood friend, she is now pursued by his vengeful lover. Will she find refuge in Iscah, the so-called gentle North?</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>I got into this a bit late for Winter VN Jam but managed to finish it on time. As such I\u00a0cut a lot of corners with the background art &amp; sound. Have plans to improve on that next.</p>\r\n\r\nContent\r\n<p>Not sure what is the best way to add content warnings here (will look at it after having got some sleep) but the Last of the Lords of Ice does touch on some sensitive issues and includes antiquated ideas about mental health &amp; women.
