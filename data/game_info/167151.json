Sorry for this Inconvience.</p><p>10/1/2016 - Where have I been? - School Simulator X and the Other Games work on by RainbowKappa789 Incorporated have been on a stand still for the last few months due to the aid to form a new company called PowerSourceStudios. I have good news and bad news regarding the School Simulator X Franchise and the other Franchises and games created by RainbowKappa789 Incorporated. The Good News is RainbowKappa789 isn't dead but the Bad News is that the company has moved which means RainbowKappa789 Inc. has reached it's final destination. What's does this mean exactly? We have decided to work with Kaidish and others to form PowerSourceStudios like said above and it was definitely a good move for my career as a game developer, but sadly School Simulator and Universal Adventures (The 2 Main Franchises of the Series) can't be achieved with this new start. I am trying to explain that Universal Adventures was Discontinued right before Beta since of lack of time and I had the ideas but had no way to develop them. School Simulator X was completed with 2 DLC Packs ,but 1 was technically exclusive originally in The Review Copy which now is $9.99 USD on Itch.io. The April Fools 2016 DLC was really the only DLC which was Released after it's Official Release, and sadly we're cutting it short there with the DLC Plans. School Simulator X is still being supported under RainbowKappa789 Himself but the company is dead officially and have moved to PowerSourceStudios. I am Very Very Very Sorry for this Annoucement and I hope you guys don't get mad at me. I hope to see you in many more games to come like the Narrator Once Said and Hey, Maybe one day we will remake this into a Sequal and reclaim it's Franchise! But till later... We're out! - RainbowKappa789 (RainbowKappa789 Inc. Founder/ CEO, PowerSourceStudios Co-Founder/Co-CEO)</p><p>12/23/2016 - Hey... RainbowKappa789 here, We are going to be using this account for my personal games since I technically make games but not with KaiDish often at least, only really take credit of each other's work. We will still published main works we do together and such, but for my solo works at least I will post here. :P Looks like We're back!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4eebb443697b8ac3da885b432ffbc30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["RainbowKappaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
