However, instead of shooting, the game focuses heavily on avoiding bullets through clever movement and with the help of a dodge. This dodge (or roll), rolls the dice on a number of different modifiers which in turn can either help you or harm you. The roll is your most powerful movement option as the movement speed is quite slow so you have to access the risk/reward of a short term benefit to potentially a longer term consequence. The roll also is your only offensive tool since it destroys all projectiles around you, it basically acts as a get out of jail free card, although it is on a cooldown so you have to pick your time wisely!<br/>The goal is survive as long as possible!<br/></p>\n<p><strong># Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p>SPACE for rolling (in the direction of your movement)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>#Info</strong></p>\n<p>If your PC has trouble with all the lights, I put an option in the main menu to deactivate the 2D lighting<strong><br/>#Engine\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Godot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3b67d84c5d02363798bb8ac2a64f385.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samjahraus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
