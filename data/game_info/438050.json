But over time, the more problems are avoided the more they become and increase in intensity, until the character will be completely overwhelmed.</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p><strong>DRAW SIGNS TO DEFEAT THE YOKAI</strong></p>\n<p>To defeat the enemies you will have to trace the correct symbols through your movements. There are six symbols that change with each wave, get ready and test your reflexes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Defeat the enemies without getting hit to charge your secret technique and overwhelm the Yokai with the special symbol!</p>\n<p>If things are going to get out of hand, you also have another special move available to wipe out all enemies in sight,; be careful though, you can only use it a limited number of times</p>\n<p><strong>EIGHT UNIQUE ENEMIES</strong></p>\n<p>In the game there are eight types of enemies: each of them is a different threat to the player, learn their behavior to deal with the various waves more effectively, choosing in what order to get rid of them!</p>\n<p><strong>INTENSITY</strong></p>\n<p>The better you are, the more difficult the game becomes, but also the points obtained will be more. Maintain the flow and demonstrate your skills.</p>\n<p><strong>A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAVES</strong></p>\n<p>Enemies do not appear randomly, but are part of pre-established waves. Which waves you will face, however, will be decided by fate. Learn to recognize patterns to be prepared for threats!\u00a0Some waves will only appear at higher intensities.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>ENDLESS GAME AND SCORE SYSTEM</strong></p>\n<p>Hold on as long as you can and beat the highscore! Take advantage of combos and kill enemies when they are closest to the grid for bonus points.</p>\n<p><strong>INK </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Defeat the Yokai before they get too close to you or dodge them to avoid losing great quantities of ink and decreasing your maximum capacity of it. Be careful though, the enemies who reach your ink supply will take away a minor quantity of it. You need ink to trace the symbols; avoid running out of ink by killing enemy to refill it. If you run out of ink, you lose the game.</p>\n<p><strong>POWER UPS\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>Power ups will occasionally appear on the grid which will allow you to have temporary bonuses. Try to catch them without getting hit by incoming enemies and evaluate the best time to do it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEVELOPED BY:</strong></p>\n<p>ONION GAMES TEAM (EVENT HORIZON SCHOOL MILAN, YEAR 1, 2019/2020)</p>\n<p>Game Design:\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Andrea Facchinetti</li><li>Alex Silvestri</li><li>Francesco Stoppa</li><li>Matteo Nigro</li><li>Ivan Tummolo</li></ul>\n<p>Programming:\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Eleonora Tiritiello</li><li>Riccardo Giuri</li><li>William Degrandis</li><li>Daniele Comotti</li></ul>\n<p>Concept Art:\r\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Lara Rusenenti</li><li>Giulia Meli</li><li>Daiana Gigliotti</li><li>Brandon Hernandez</li><li>Martina Archetti</li><li>Manale El Allame</li><li>Lara Bonamici</li></ul>\n<p>3D Art:</p>\n<ul><li>Alex Zerbato<br/>\n</li><li>Andrea Giurano\r\n</li><li>Edoardo Torti\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c52ea9ad4146117c729d02e95701ad3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Event Horizon School"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
