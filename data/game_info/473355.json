Its a quick, simple game. If you know the Youtuber BRACKEYS, i'm sure you would be able to tell where this game is inspired from. He is a great beginner Unity teacher, he taught me everything I know about Unity so far in a clear and comfortable manner. I would greatly recommend checking out his channel. This game is a version of his tutorial game, but with me putting a twist on it and some improvements and expansio.n\u00a0I would most definitely recommend playing this with your friends as a competition to see who would be able to finish all levels first. Good for killing time during this lock down as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/2152560191429038ae45488e3a999e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LaughingBuddah"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
