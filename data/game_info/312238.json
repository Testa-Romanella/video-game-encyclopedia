Navigate through the obstacles , but don't fall into the pit. Checkpoints will be there to make sure you don't lose too much time.

The initial version started from the top and descending, but we found out that the obstacles could easily be skipped so we reversed the level around. Nonetheless, playtesting with different people showed that there are still ways to cleverly get past certain points, which from a design standpoint makes the gameplay more interesting if you are looking to get the shortest time on the course.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Art: Joaquin Pelz</p>\n<p>Gameplay: Robert Bazoiu<br/></p>\n<p>Game &amp; Level Design: Robert Bazoiu, Joaquin Pelz<br/></p>\n<p>Music: De4dl0ck (https://de4dl0ck.newgrounds.com)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:13:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/490/4902468480c62531b9879fdb198c367c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobertPhillipB"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
