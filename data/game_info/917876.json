The app will be updated weekly with bugfixes, gameplay updates, and new content weekly.<br/><br/>They Came From Earth...Again<br/><ul><li>The Sequel to a game I made for a game jam in the past. Play as an astronaut collecting aliens in order to become the richest man in the galaxy. Travel to different planets; upgrade your ship to enable safer, faster, and more efficient farming of aliens; and gain achievements to prove to the galaxy you are the richest and most successful alien hunter alive. But be careful of alien turrets and tanks as they will try to stop you as you take their citizens. Do you have what it takes to become the best alien hunter there has ever been?</li></ul><br/>Bending Battles<br/><ul><li> A quick-paced sporting game that pits two teams of mages against one another in territorial combat. The objective is to push forward as much as possible within the time limit or knock all members of the enemy team off of the arena. Players can play as a variety of characters, each with a unique ability that offers either offensive, defensive, or utility to your team. Knock players back with your spells in order to push forward but be careful not to be knocked back yourself.</li></ul><br/>Mages and Monsters<br/><ul><li> The party game where you and your friends work together to successfully complete a quest. Team up with a group of friends as a band of mages trying to complete quests to obtain gold and glory. Play as a variety of characters, each with unique stats, skills, and looks. Attempt different quests that offer unique experiences each time you attempt them. While on the quests, attack monsters, creatures, and other enemies; talk with NPCs that offer wares, training, and unique challenges; make decisions about traversing the land that impacts the party; and cook food for your party that either helps or hurts your party.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T05:34:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6301ed02c79943b54f00dfde8193be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elemental Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Elemental Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
