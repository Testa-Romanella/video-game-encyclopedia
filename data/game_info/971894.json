When disaster strikes, players can only continue to climb up to save their lives, but the upward process is not smooth sailing, with tree trunks covering the top and water surface attacks below. At this point, players need to click the mouse to control the cartoon character to move left or right to avoid the tree trunk, in order to continue running up and avoid attacks from the water below. There are gold coin rewards along the way, and the more gold coins you receive, the higher your score. <br/>\r\nThe speed of escaping upwards is getting faster and faster. Between higher scores and faster speed, you must react. <br/>\r\nDo you want to give it a try?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T05:43:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/44239b1e87c00777471e83595e7062ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Architectura"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Architectura"], "esrb_rating": null}
