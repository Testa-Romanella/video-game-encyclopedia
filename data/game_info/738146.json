We don't want you to unscrew thousands of screws like other games. We offer to you, a fun car repair simulation with simple mechanics.<br/><br/><br/>It was an ordinary Monday, Kevin got ready to go to work. And he got in his car, but the car was not starting. Kevin thought for a long time and opened the hood, and poked around at random cables. And Kevin somehow started the car. The UNGA BUNGA method had been worked. The day was the day that kevin changed his career, now he is going to fix cars instead of working in a boring software job.<br/><br/><br/>Prepare a hot coffee for yourself, then open the game (the drink is not mandatory, its optional, you can play the game with the drink you want).<br/>The game is quite simple, check your e-mails on the computer and choose a job you like, after that you need to start doing what the customer requests. You can improve your garage with the money you earn, when you upgrade your garage you will have more equipment so you can do different jobs and earn more money.<br/><br/><br/>You can support us by adding the game to the wishlist.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T03:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67a/67a6d96fe0d9792f1c16bcc58607fb40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HasanKlncc"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HasanKlncc"], "esrb_rating": null}
