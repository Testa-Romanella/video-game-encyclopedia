Sadly\u00a0I could not participate due to lack of time, so I set myself a limit of roughly two and a half to three\u00a0days (the time I imagined I'd realistically would have had during the jam), started reading and watching tutorials and began coding.\u00a0The result is this little game.</p>\n<p>What can I say? I had a lot of fun with the engine, and decided to work a little more on this project. The \"JAM result\" will still be downloadable here, but the browser version will be updated (hopefully regularly).</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun with the game. I am very grateful for any kind of feedback!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goal\u00a0<br/></strong>Transport all the animals (rectangular cuboids) on board your spaceship and avoid (or kill?)\u00a0the people (cubes) who want to keep them for themselves.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rules<br/></strong>Animals can be brought on board your spaceship with the tractor beam. Cows (large rectangular cuboids) give more points than sheep (small rectangular cuboids), but they also take longer to pick up and therefore consume more energy.</p>\n<p>You can also use your energy to defend yourself against the people (attack them)\u00a0who throw their projectiles at you.</p>\n<p>The game ends when you have freed all the animals or your health drops to zero.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<strong>Action</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Controller</strong>MovementWSAD or Arrow KeysLeft Stick<br/>Tractor BeamSpaceFace Button South<br/>(e.g. Xbox\u00a0: A, PS: X)AttackE or Ctrl/StrgFace\u00a0Button West<br/>(e.g. Xbox: X, PS: Square)PauseESCStart\r\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>FAQ\r\n<br/></strong>Probably.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Q: The game freezes when I press \"EXIT\"\u00a0.
