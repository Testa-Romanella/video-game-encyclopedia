The prompt was to make a game with two levels. I made a shooting game where you shoot the alien to win the game!</p><p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p><p><strong>WASD - </strong>Move Beanie (the blue bean)</p><p>Use the <strong>mouse</strong> to aim and <strong>left-click</strong> to shoot the alien!</p><p><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Things I would like to work on:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The sizing of the game. Please use full screen!</li><li>More visuals! And music! And sound effects!</li><li>The shots from the enemy are WEIRD! </li></ul><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Last Thoughts:</strong></p>\n<p>My second game! This was a lot harder and I spend a lot of time on this game. I enjoyed the process...somewhat. Like my first game, I would like to work on this more at a later point in time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c48f2b2ef0ca63c3e75122f2565d940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sarahjrom"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
