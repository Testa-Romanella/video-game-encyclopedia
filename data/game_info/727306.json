The theme for this jam was: \"ENTIRE GAME ON ONE SCREEN\".</p>\n<p>There are obvious shortcomings due to the time constraint and team size (solo), but the core game is playable and somewhat enjoyable. Leave a comment if you want me to polish it some more or add more features, I have many ideas and things planned that I wasn't able to make in time.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Use the arrowkeys on your keyboard to move. That's it.<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:<br/></p>\n<p>Attack enemies by moving into them, but if you try to attack from the front, you will die, so sneak around them!!</p>\n<p>As you progress, time will go faster and faster, which means enemies will move and spawn faster. Try to keep your cool and plan your route quickly and efficiently.<br/></p>\n<p>POWERUPS:</p>\n<p>COINS - awards points</p>\n<p>SHIELD - invulnerable for a small period</p>\n<p>SCROLL OF TIME - make time go slower<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T09:37:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d91594c33eda886082b94cef0710caf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artiknappa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
