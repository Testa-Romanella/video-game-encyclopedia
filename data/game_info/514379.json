Anyway, lessons learnt about building a game early, here's the game I intended to enter, un-modified since the jam.</p>\n<p>You play an assassin and there is a wall between your target. You have one bullet to kill your target through the wall with your gun. Make use of the target interacting with their room and the layout of your room to pin point their location for an accurate kill, you've only got one shot!</p>\n<p>Headphones recommended,\u00a0Sound required!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T07:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ea/7eadafc5facc639e75ec060a33812fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["willhenniker"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
