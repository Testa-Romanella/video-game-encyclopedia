On top of that we\u2019ve simulated real driving physics for each vehicle.<br/><br/>CUSTOMIZE<br/>Offroad PRO is about customization as much as it is about driving cars and 4x4 trucks. Anyone, who ever dipped his toe in a real off-road activity knows, that you spend us much time in the garage twerking, fixing and tuning up your set-up as much as inside a driver's cabin on an off road track. So don\u2019t worry - we got you covered. With several different vehicle classes such as ATV, UTV, quad, crawler, classic 4x4 jeep and special cars and trucks everyone will find a great setup to start with. Then comes the fun part - control damping, stiffness, travel and dozen more parameters,  swap suspension and engines, change tires, add lights, bullbars, roof racks and many more. Customize your looks by changing paints, adding vinyls, or grab a gas tank and camping gear on the roof. The options are countless, so build your rig now and show that you\u2019re the real off road professional.<br/><br/>Note: If you choose to join as an Offroad PRO member, you are agreeing to an auto-renewing subscription plan that will automatically be charged every month through your account for $4.99.
