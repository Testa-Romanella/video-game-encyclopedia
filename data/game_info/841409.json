Well, probably not, but here we are anyway \ud83d\ude17. Make your way down a dark and dangerous land full of menacing creatures that can and definitely will hurt you. Destroy these creatures, earn tokens, die, and...do it all over again because this game is a roguelike \ud83d\ude0c. But hey, don't fret. Your earned tokens can be used to permanently unlock customization for our lovely cat so that the next time you die, you will at least die in style \ud83d\ude05.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-purposed Jetpack:</strong> A movement utility? A weapon? How about both? Use the jetpack wisely to battle against these creatures or run away from them, your choice: fight or flight.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Customization:</strong> You can unlock customization skins inspired by some of pop culture's most famous (or infamous) cats. Who are they? You'll have to find out.</p>\n<p><strong>Boss Fights and Secrets:</strong> As you venture deeper and deeper into the unknown land, more, let's say, <em>curious</em> creatures will stand in your way. Use the experience you've gained to defeat them \u270a.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T10:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e6/0e601015c7cb43c884af8368e58250c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tabby Cat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
