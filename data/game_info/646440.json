People come here, many from faraway lands, some seek peace, others seek religious freedom, some seek asylum, others seek adventure. One thing is certain: they all are taking their shot here in the Isle of Strife, and it's YOU who can\u00a0make sure they get along... or can you?</p>\n<p>Populate the tiny town of Strife Isle, and place people in homes where they can get peace of mind. It's not an easy task, as their desires, faults and likenesses are but obstacles to trust and peace.</p>\n<p>Once the island's total STRIFE level reaches 100, it's Game Over. Try to see how many people you can get together on the same island, and for how long they can stay there before wreaking havoc!</p>\n<p><strong>Possible SPOILERS below</strong>, don't read this part if you want to discover the game for yourself.
