Hunt down the likes of snakes, bats, and bison with your (not so) trusty arsenal of six-shooters, shotguns, rifles, and beans!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WASD - Move</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Left Click - Use Item / Shoot</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Alt + F4 - Quit</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sterling Rios: Design, Art / Animation, Audio, Programming</p>\n<p>Zach Flores:\u00a0 Programming, Design\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:29:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a82056bb827aeec6974c2188f800bffe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sterling Rios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
