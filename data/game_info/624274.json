I tried to play with the same effect @saranomy used for \"I heard a dog barking\", but maybe add some extra challenge there.</p><p>Still lots to learn about storytelling and pacing there, I kinda just dumped a bunch of exposition at the beginning. Had some cool ideas for having thoughts show up while you wandered the maze, especially when you reach a dead end, but I ran out of time to actually do it. \ud83d\ude05</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f589370db903706d1cf85326490daa79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lila-k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
