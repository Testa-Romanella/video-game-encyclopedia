The goal was to make a survival game where you would collect wood and food to survive as many nights as possible; however, in two days we were only able to implement a tree cutting simulator. Currently, you run around cutting down every tree you see and collect fruit to replenish your stamina, if you run out of stamina you can no longer use your axe and you take damage until you find and eat some fruit.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I had coded the player movement, combat/action, inventory, interaction, and stats systems.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ahmad Faiyaz\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0Audio Engineer</p>\n<p>Dilan Huang - Artist</p>\n<p>Jordan Barden - Programmer</p>\n<p>Naveen Sabharwal - Programmer</p>\n<p>Nicholas Way - Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T10:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43b/43b508b5a3710f890073b2163ccfed74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jorbar@umich.edu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
