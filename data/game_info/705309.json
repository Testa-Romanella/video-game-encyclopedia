The\u00a0game is based on another game I used to play called \"World's Hardest Game\" or something like that.</p>\n<p>This demo contains 5 levels that I've been working on. I'm also planning to add a speedrun mode for the full game (already in the works).</p>\n\r\nGame Instructions\r\n<p>You are the magenta cube. Your goal is to reach the level exit dying as less as possible.</p>\n<p>Avoid touching blue and red bombs. The blue ones will kill you. The red ones will kill you and reset the whole level to its original state.</p>\n<p>Some level exits are blocked by doors that can only be opened by pressing switches matching the door's colour.</p>\n<p>Remember: this game is meant to be hard. Try to be as fast as possible. Every move counts.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space Philately (+ seamless loop) by Subdream (visit https://soundcloud.com/subdream)</p>\n<p>Sound effects:</p>\n<p>ChipTone (visit https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T11:07:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39805a288ad8eefd025f84f26a7b389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Reinhardt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
