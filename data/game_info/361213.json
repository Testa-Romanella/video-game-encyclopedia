No aim assist, no reloads. One Bullet, One Shot, One Enemy, One Life.\u00a0Risk it all on one shot against the best.\u00a0With your honor on the line,\u00a0 will you prevail?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made for the third annual Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam.\u00a0 The theme is \"Only One\", and I\u00a0decided to use that to make a Dueling Game. Gun Duels in the old days were often fought on as fair as grounds as possible. This meant that only one bullet was usually used and only one shot was fired per person. I\u00a0decided to capture this in a game featuring dueling Robots, because obviously.<br/><br/>I\u00a0hope you enjoy this game as much as I\u00a0enjoyed making it. It is heavily influenced by Western film. It is\u00a0especially inspired by the duel in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" by\u00a0Sergio Leone. The music, which was also inspired by westerns, was composed from scratch by Austin Slade Jones, who managed to turn this around in a night!\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************</p>\n<p>Browser playable version added after the fact due to convenience for reviewers, no changes have been made.\u00a0please download for\u00a0\u00a0on-time entry and full experience.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bced32f993e08b227b8da847c48e88b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Vakuzar"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
