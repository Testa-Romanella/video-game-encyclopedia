Click on the farming plots to bring up the crop menu, click again to close it. You can unlock more space and crop types by reaching certain crop numbers. The dice in the top left of a crop panel is how much\u00a0it costs to buy, the one in the bottom right is how much it sells for.</p>\n<p>You can rotate around the scene with WASD.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*You can get 3 more Islands by reaching goals however past the first unlock it may not work. Play-testing the build it has worked as many times as it hasn't so I don't know how to fix it unfortunately\u00a0:/*</p>\n<p>This game marks exactly one year since I started teaching myself game development, this time last year I was bored and decided to just sit down and do it and I started with the Kenney Jam 2021. So even though this game isn't that great, I'm really proud of how far I've come so far and I really feel like I've improved a lot.</p>\n<p>Anyway I hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d397d92d8c7a9b22b55a6860d1eb96e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beetBlocks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
