I only made two levels and a boss before stopping (after nearly two years), and for #RemakeJam I remade those two levels using my C++ framework as opposed to Game Maker 8.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, time really wasn't really on my side. I could only work on this during my evenings and lunch breaks. If I had more time I bet I could add more and make it nicer, but I'm not too bothered. Doing this jam was a great trip down memory lane!</p>\n<p>Game - Developed by Me</p>\n<p>Sprites - Final Fantasy NES Sprite Sheets (as well as backgrounds from the original)</p>\n<p>Music - Works from OverClocked Remix</p>\n<p>Sounds - BFXR and Audacity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c09af542265aa1d76cce737081b220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
