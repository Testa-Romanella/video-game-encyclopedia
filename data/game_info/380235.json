Sorry for the annoying parts, but this was my best luck.</em></p>\n<p>SFX makes no sense.<br/><em>Ge-ne-ra-ted. The sound overall is the most frustrating part, but I did my best to reduce all the damage to the Universe.</em></p>\n<p>The game is slow/boring &amp; you miss the theme.<br/><em>The same answer for both - this theme is the worst I ever got in a game jam. I will be very happy to hear how to improve the game AND keep the theme.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I hope you guys had more fun and inspiration than I did. Thank you for playing my game.
