S or down arrow is attack, A and D or left arrow and right arrow are left and right. W and up arrow are jump and press again whilst in the air to double jump. Pick up power ups to gain an edge over your opponent. Any donations will go towards better software to make an improved version. I really hope you enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae3a1f8416db9b05d6ef2ff0751779af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GbsnDan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
