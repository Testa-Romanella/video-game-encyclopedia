It is a game where you try to achieve the highest score.</p><p>It is a reaction based game where you have to coordinate player\u00b4s hand between the 8 character keys and 3 utility keys in order to type the code displayed on the monitor.</p><p>There are 3 big changes and one continuous change making the gameplay a little bit harder and faster. (These changes are listed down below under the \"Spoiler line\")</p><p><strong>(Just funfacts)</strong></p><p>The whole game consists only of cubes and the highscore is only on the local machine. It is my first entry at Ludum Dare. I worked something between 8 and 11 hours on this game. My idea -&gt; How to make you as player use more buttons even though you can control the game with only two buttons.</p><p>Have Fun!</p><p><strong>-----Spoilers------</strong></p><p>Changes:</p><p>[Continuous] The length of words get longer with your increasing high score (min 3 - max 17 characters)</p><p>Bigger changes:</p><p>1. After achieving 750 Score you begin to type faster.</p><p>2. After 2:30 Minutes of in-game time, the time changes from limitless time per round to a countdown based on your score and in-game time.</p><p>3. After 4:40 Minutes of in-game time you have to type the words in reversed order.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc4/fc4a52b7355b31ad2c00d6fe4443918f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["David GameDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
