Just requires a keyboard.</p>\n<p>I worked on it alone and\u00a0thought many ideas, but this seemed the fastest and fast it was, but also had many more mini-games in mind to get new faces that I couldn't add in time. Anymay, at least looks decent and gave me some new knowledge. Hope you enjoy it ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to Lemmino for lending his song \"Parallax\".
