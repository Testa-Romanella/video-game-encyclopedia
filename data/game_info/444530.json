All powers share the same resource so each and every instance of using your power to sneak by a light or to get more information on enemy positions will decrease the options available to you, so remember to always act wisely. Currently in development by a 3 man Portuguese team for a school project, we look forward to the day when project Shadeborn is complete. We will be sure to keep you updated as time goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to check out our twitter and our Indiedb!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d670983ba5e96e6fa341bee123f20af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creative Flow Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
