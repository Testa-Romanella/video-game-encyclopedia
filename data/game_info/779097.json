But apparently, moving on means enrolling at a community college in a supernatural town overflowing with monsters and dark magic...\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>returning players:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>We ask that you start completely anew. A lot has changed since we released our demo, and if you start from an old save you risk breaking your game or running into errors.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>versions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Currently, the .pc and .mac versions are being revised. If you do not own an Android device, we ask that you download an Android emulator on your computer to play, like Nox or BlueStacks. We apologize for the inconvenience.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>on saving:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>This game does not have automatic saving.\u00a0<strong>You will need to save manually</strong>. The good news is that you have an unlimited amount of save slots, and can load them at any time. So if you have a particular scene you really like, you can save before it and then load it up to play that particular scene.\r\n</li><li>When you reach the end of each chapter, you'll get a screen letting you know the chapter is finished. You'll also receive another prompt telling you to save. If you continue without saving and there are no other chapters out, the game will go back to the main menu and your progress will be lost.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>release schedule for part 1:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>April 30: Chapter 3</li><li>May 7: Chapter 4\u00a0</li><li>May 13: Chapter 5</li><li>May 20: Chapter 6\u00a0</li><li><strong>TWO WEEK BREAK</strong></li><li>June 3: Chapter 7</li><li>June 10: Chapter 8\u00a0</li><li>June 17: Chapter 9</li><li>June 24: Chapter 10\u00a0</li><li>July 1: Chapter 11</li></ul>\n<p>We will be releasing at 12pm EST on the respective days.
