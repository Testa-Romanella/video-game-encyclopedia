As he woke up, he somehow landed in hell! Try to help Paul to escape, so he can get there in time and maybe even collect some roses on the way?</p>\n<p>As a human-being different rules apply to his life. Usually there are only ghosts in the underworld, but as Paul is still alive he can get a second life if he dies at humans, but as ghost you have some limitations...</p>\n<p>Sounds intresting? Press Play to help him.</p>\n<p>(Note: This game can get pretty hard sometimes, which is why there is a option to disable death. This is NOT the way you are supposed to play. But if you have problems with the difficulty or just want to mess around and do goofy things, you have the option to activate this. But I encourage you to try to beat\u00a0 the game the intended way)</p>\n\n<p><em>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T09:44:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5f4d7e59a667314a9afdda4da31da98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kinda Good Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
