You play as Yolanda, a witch who loves gardening, and her magic helps her with this! Or... Hinders her. As you walk, you plant seeds, and as you pick flowers, your magic causes all the nearby flowers to grow faster! Add to this how some flowers don't get along with each-other, and you've got a florist who has more flowers then she can deal with! Pick flowers and deliver them to those who need them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Space or Z to pick a plant or deliver to a window</p>\n<p>Press Shift or X to destroy a plant</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Tile Set: Kenney Game Assets<br/>Character Sprite : D Machin<br/>Speech Bubbles : Kicked-In-Teeth<br/>Pick-Up Sound effect : Kenney Game Assets<br/>Fonts : Kenney Game Assets, somepx and prettypinkpansy<br/>Photo :\u00a0Joanna Kosinska on Unsplash<br/>Photo :\u00a0Nagesh Badu on Unsplash<br/>Music by Cosmin Mirza (cosminmirza.com)</p>\n<p>Plants, Icons, Thank You's and programming :\u00a0ME!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ced/ced13defc9a349a95dc7c010f2154dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GreenClovers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
