A slightly enhanced port of the game was later released for the Dreamcast, as well as a handheld version for the Game Boy Color. The game is named after the WWF's then-current \"Attitude\" marketing campaign, with the tagline \"Get it\" also being used on company programming during that period.</p>\n<p>The game is the sequel to WWF War Zone and is the last WWF game to be published by Acclaim. The WWF signed a deal with THQ later in 1999, ending a ten-year relationship with Acclaim that began with WWF WrestleMania. Acclaim then signed a deal with Extreme Championship Wrestling, producing two games using the same game engine, ECW Hardcore Revolution and ECW Anarchy Rulz.</p>\n<p>The game is dedicated to Owen Hart, who died at a WWF event on May 23, 1999.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-14T09:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d81/d81f1c40004227323a34f5fc2f978cf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.64, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 397, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "PlayStation", "Nintendo 64", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Acclaim Studios Austin", "Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment", "Acclaim Sports"], "esrb_rating": null}
