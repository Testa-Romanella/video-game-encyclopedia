Homemade Grilled Cheese machines are locked away in the farthest reaches of the galaxy by Emperor Xerxes. The Republic of Arlon has fallen. Klepto Phantasmagoria has escaped the clutches of Captain Vernon Ardala and has angered Wiaxx the Merciful for the last time. With little time left for the few survivors of the Resistance of Arlon, Phantasmagoria must steal back the Molten Core of Uxane that was recently obtained by the now turned Wiaxx the Unmerciful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the knowledge of the recently turned Wiaxx, he commands Phantasmagoria to venture back to Ardala\u2019s star system and reclaim the Core before the Resistance of Arlon reclaims the Core and reunites the galaxy through the Resistance of Arlon. Phantasmagoria uses the power of CyberChase (Not the PBS Kids cartoon - Do not sue.) to slip between the security of the Empire of Xerxes to obtain the one and only weakness of Ardala; grilled cheese on a brioche bun.</p>\n<p>Upon successfully using Wiaxx the Merciful - now Wiaxx the Unmerciful\u2019s old elevated key access code to obtain the Legendary Golden Grilled Cheese Maker. With the weakness of Ardala in hand, Phantasmagoria goes to confront him head on in what will be the final battle for one of them. Who will win? Find out in: Klepto and Arduous Quest for Grilled Cheese.</p>\n<p>Klepto Phantasmagoria: The number one fugitive on the Intergalactic Protection Force\u2019s most wanted.
