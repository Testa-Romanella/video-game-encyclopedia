Have you ever felt you needed a hotel desk bell? Or a bzzzzzzz \u201cyou're wrong!\u201d buzzer? Fire off a good punchline, followed by a rimshot. We don't have the world's tiniest violin, but there is a sad trombone. All of these sound cues, and more, can live in the little magic yellow device in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Each direction button as well as A and B kick off different sound samples. The crank lets you move between different sound groups.</p>\n<p>Audio Plywood is free to download and use. I hope it brings you laughter and joy at just the right times. More information about the audio samples can be found on my website.</p>\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n<p>Q: How much space does it take up?<br/>A: Audio samples, even at low quality, are large. The app is mostly audio samples. In total, you're looking at about 1.3MB of space on the Playdate.</p>\n<p>Q: What's the best way to use Audio Plywood?<br/>A: I find it best to launch the app, use the crank to select a sound sound, hit the power button to put the playdate to sleep, and then put it in the pocket of your jacket or hoodie. Without looking at the screen, you can double-tap the power to wake it up, hit the sound effect buttons of your choosing, then hit power to sleep the device.</p>\n<p>Q: Is this technically the first fart app for the Playdate?<br/>A: To my knowledge, yes. I can't wait to see the first flashlight app.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I customize Audio Plywood with my own sounds?<br/>A: At this time, no. But be sure to keep an eye open for future updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T23:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09f/09f88032bcf21c204c9a739868223bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Enigma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
