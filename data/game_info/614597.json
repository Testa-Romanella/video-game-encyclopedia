In the experiment, the outcome is only decided at the moment the experiment is observed. <strong>In the game, map tiles are (re)generated by looking at them, so you move through an ever-changing environment.</strong> The goal is to save as many cats as possible wile being chased by an enemy. If you find yourself trapped by a wall just look again, maybe you'll find a way. But be careful every time you'll look at a cat there is a chance it will die. You can throw glowing mines to keep the enemy at bay and to lock down areas, so they won't regenerate when being looked at.</p>\n<p>We only had one and a half day to work on this, but we hope you'll still enjoy it :&gt;</p>\n<p>If you are a fellow jamer write us a comment and well play your game &lt;3<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:55:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf996beff2d358a4666516ca65825ba7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qu0d0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
