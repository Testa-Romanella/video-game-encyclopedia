Meet \"12\" a young seahawk hatched in the inner cities \"Central District\". 12 is PNW bred and fed and loves everything about Seattle: Ezell's Chicken, The Super Sonics, Garfield High School, Jack Benaroya, I-5 North, Oh Boy! Oberto, R&amp;L Home Of Good Bar-B-Q, Ivars, Ludusport, UniVsall Embassy, Microsoft, Amazon, Macklemore, Shabazz Palaces, Porter Ray, Sir Mix A lot, EMP, Nirvana, Quincy Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Bruce Lee, London G. Miller, and yes The Seattle Seahawks!<br/><br/>Help 12 by catching the small trinkets that appear on the field as other 12's cheer you on. Don't forgot to catch the football, this is always the \"play maker\" to get you through (hint, hint, hint). Collect coins as you zip downfield if you'd like to \"draft\" other players onto your team (choose different players). Be sure and remember to stay away from the sharp \"cleat spikes\" and the enemy helmets though!<br/><br/>Share your best score's with friends and family via social media, text, email, iMessage, or leaderboard rankings for bragging rights. Be on the lookout for upcoming social media giveaways (t-shirts) too! <br/><br/>Don't forget to also download our official iOS Sticker App \"12 The Seahawk Stickers\" available on The App Store.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T03:57:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43e13f584774742eafb30e011c28acf0_sD1byCj.jpg", "website": "http://advergames.io", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ADVERGAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["ADVERGAMES"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
