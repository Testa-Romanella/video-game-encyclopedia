{"id": 977185, "slug": "the-hamsters-journey", "name": "The Hamster's Journey", "name_original": "The Hamster's Journey", "description": "The Hamster's Journey is a roguelite platformer about combining hats and pants to overcome the obstacles that get in your way, while being chased by the ominous Hamster's Nightmare.<br/><br/>Throughout the levels, you can unlock and pick up a variety of <strong>pants</strong>, such as the pogo pants and the skateboard pants, which affect how you move and how you jump. You'll also find <strong>hats</strong>. These are your actions: Equip the grapple hook hat to swing from the scenery or the dash hat for a quick horizontal burst of speed. There are dozens of unique pairings of hats and pants, and finding a winning combination - or making the most of a bad one - is what The Hamster's Journey is all about!<br/><br/>This is a game about variety of movement, and finding the right tool for the job. But then again, using the worst combinations can sometimes help you find unexpected secrets!<br/><br/>If you make it far enough - and fast enough - you can make it all the way to the end of a world, and unlock the door to the next one. In the end, perhaps the intrepid hamster really can escape and see what's out there in the real world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T06:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/274/27490b987210fa10cd1843ad352ea590.jpg", "website": "https://rainjamgames.neocities.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rain Jam Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Various Tuesdays"], "esrb_rating": null}
