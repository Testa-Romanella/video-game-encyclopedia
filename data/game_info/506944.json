I'm here to present a game I made. It's simple, really, and rather short. It's the story of my owner who had troubles dealing with a break-up (even though he's the one who responsible for it).</p>\n<p>I'll highlight that it is\u00a0my first game so adversity is to be expected. By the way, I'll be thankful to anyone who'll put any bug into light.</p>\n<p>Thank you for stopping by. I hope you like the game.\u00a0You can download it for free. If you feel like it, there's also a possibility to support me as I plan to mass produce toy figures of myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:03:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/1288464e7202494566afdb5ec059f80a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kyojahyl"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
