All in all I made only two games and this is the second one.\u00a0 I hope, you will like this short demo version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game you can play with two levels, you can see some features, level design, some enemies what you have to fight against.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would like to tell some future-features:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jinns and medusas will range enemies.</p>\n<p>I would like to make a better menu, with options and load game.</p>\n<p>There will be saving system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would like to create all in all 9 main levels, after every third with a boss room plus secret levels. 3 levels like this first, 3 like this second, the other three levels are suprise ;) In every 3 level-series you will get different enemies, so it follows on that there will be much more kind of enemies!\u00a0Oh yes, about the enemies: now you can run across them, but I will change it in the future, there will be a stomping system (if you touch them or jump on their head, you will get damage, if you hit them, they will jump back)\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the future you won't see, where a secret wall is. You have to find it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan to make more platformer-tasks, power-ups, a minimal story-line, NPC interactions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lot of work is behind me, but much more in front of me. I'm going foward and I do what I have to do.</p>\n<p>If you would like to follow me, you can make it here:</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/murissimurissi<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>First Update:</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Some Enemies are weaker than the original version.</li><li>Changed Main Menu and Endscreen background.</li><li>Changed wordtype to longer sections.
