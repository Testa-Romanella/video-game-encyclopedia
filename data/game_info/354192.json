Learn the ins and outs of the game, and practice before taking on your friends! <br/><br/>Your goal in Silver is simple: have the lowest sum by the end of four rounds. To accomplish this, use abilities from the cards you draw, and from cards that are already face up in your village, which consists of five cards. You can trade in matching cards, and also trade out your cards for ones you draw to make matches or to lower your score. End a round early if you think you have the lowest sum by calling for a vote; if you\u2019re right, you score 0 points, and get to use the Silver Amulet of Protection the next round. If you're wrong, though you get the sum of your cards plus ten points!<br/><br/>The app walks you through the game, and the comprehensive Help screen gives you all the details you need to be able to play. While you\u2019re playing, view detailed card abilities just by tapping and holding on them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T15:59:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b15bb3fe9da0884d889211a730f8625.jpg", "website": "http://beziergames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bezier Games"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Bezier Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
