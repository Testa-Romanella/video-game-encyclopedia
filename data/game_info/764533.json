The journey of Order from Caos 2 is unique and has more than 20 hours of gameplay, dozens of sidequests, items, special moves, and many puzzles to solve. Enemies walk across the maps and there are no random encounters. The players will walk through forests, cities, beaches, islands, temples, secret dungeons, hidden cities and will fight powerful creatures. The players will have a lot to do in the game if they don\u2019t want to just follow the main story.<br/><br/>Order from Caos 2 has nothing to do with the events or characters shown in the first game in the series.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Order from Caos 2 tells the story of Thomas, a man who lost his family, murdered by a mysterious and cruel Knight of the Bratania Empire, known by the name of Asmodeus. Thomas embarks on a journey of revenge, vowing to destroy his most merciless enemy. However, there is one detail that could change everything, his family might\u2019ve simply never existed at all. Haunted by both possible realities, Thomas needs to understand what is behind all this tragedy to define his future that intertwines with the future of all humanity, even if it is about him going to hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are six playable characters in the main party. All of them have motives to fight the evil that is on the horizon.<br/><br/><strong>Thomas:</strong> the protagonist of the story seeks revenge for the death of his family.<br/><strong>Miguel:</strong> Thomas' amusing friend has magical powers and tells a joke or two every now and then. He has the power to summon creatures in battle.<br/><strong>Daena:</strong> a strong woman who is tired of having to prove something to the people of her town.<br/><strong>Alicia:</strong> a sweet girl who wants to put an end to the atrocities committed by the Empire of Bratania, which oppresses her small town.<br/><strong>Sigmund:</strong> a man whose broken heart may never return to its original form. A strong warrior with medicinal knowledge.<br/><strong>Rob:</strong> a mighty warrior with a strong sense of justice, but a troubled past.<br/><br/>Together, they will fight ghosts from the past, armies of enemy Empires, beings from other dimensions, and even their own personal beliefs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can walk, run, jump onto certain places and even get in the water.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To be able to upgrade weapons and evolve the status of team members, the players will need to find Lumeni Points, luminous spheres scattered around the world but in another dimension. It is possible to find Lumeni Points in many areas of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each character has unique qualities and it's up to the players to position them correctly in the battle to get the best out of them. But beware. Some enemies can change the team's position mid-battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each character has their own Skill Map. Each locked block can be opened in exchange for Lumeni Points. It is up to the players how to boost their characters. It can go the way of adding a new skill or opening the way to increase some stat of the hero in question.<h3>\"I've been developing this game for quite some time.
