As a sole operative, you are tasked with going behind enemy lines and wreaking havoc on their plans. However, you are given only eight bullets to finish the job, though their function is beyond simple lead. Gas, plague, piercing, and bouncing bullets,\u00a0 your power is only limited by your thinking.</p>\n<p>Your success lies in your planning and execution. You must assess your surroundings, identify enemy movement patterns, and figure out how to get to the end of the stage in one piece.\r\n</p>\n<p>We were inspired by TRON, James Bond, and Hotline Miami</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>The Team</p>\n<p>Carlo Barths -\u00a0Programmer</p>\n<p>Justin DeGroat -\u00a0Sound and Design</p>\n<p>Lavern Dreves\u00a0 -\u00a0Artist</p>\n<p>Allen Konrad\u00a0 -\u00a0Level/Game Designer\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Dylan Mccarroll -\u00a0Programmer, Tech Designer\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Ricky Pastore -\u00a0Artist</p>\n<p>\u00a0The Themes\u00a0 (James Bond, Hotline Miami, Tron)</p>\n<p>\u00a0Credits\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>DoozyUI 3.0:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/doozy-ui-manager-20...\r\n</p>\n<p>Odin Inspector:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-seriali...\r\n</p>\n<p>Sensor Toolkit:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/sensor-toolkit-88036\r\n</p>\n<p>Unity 2d Navmesh:\u00a0https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus\r\n</p>\n<p>All In 1 Sprite Shader:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/all-in-1-sprite-shader-156513\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/219/2190ceb2ce63f35605f2ded9fee352a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["drevesl1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
