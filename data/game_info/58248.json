Before the start of the battle, you throw a coin. If you guess - you'll go first, if not - second. The first 2 moves are cards distribution. There are 16 of them. At the beginning of each round, 2 cards are issued. After the cards are issued, you place those cards on the table (arena). That is how you finish the PROGRESS. The opponent puts the card, and if his card is more damaging than your health, he beats your card. If the damage of the enemy card is less than your health, he will not be able to beat the card, and in the next move they are both destroyed. If the damage of the enemy card is equal to your health, the mutual destruction of cards happens. There are several variants. For example, the player who is last, gets beaten and both his card and the opponent stays in the arena. In some cases, draws take into consideration the elements of the map (water extinguishes the fire, the fire burns the earth), the rest is neutral. One card can win no more than 2 opponents. After that they are both destroyed. If the last move you made is with the Krakorus card, then your opponent will be defeated, otherwise he will defeat you. In the case of equalization - it is a draw.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-achievements;<br/>\r\n-pleasant graphics;<br/>\r\n-simple management;<br/>\r\n-interesting gameplay;<br/>\r\n-light music;<br/>\r\n-available in 2 languages;<br/>\r\n-15 levels", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c41/c41784a428a887e80ed69bec6b91b6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GiBar", "Happy Panda Studio Pty"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RoBot", "HAPPY PANDA STUDIO PTY"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
