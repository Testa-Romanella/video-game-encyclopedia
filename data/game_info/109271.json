After playing Super Mario Kart, I used to go home, turn on our PC, and pretend to play Super Mario Kart in MS Paint by dragging the paintbrush tool around a top-down version of the track. This is an attempt to recreate that. </p><p>Race a line around the track. Arrows to accelerate, brake, and turn. </p><p>'r' to restart on a randomly selected track.</p><p>Press '2' to spawn a second player. w, a, s, d to control this player. </p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools.
