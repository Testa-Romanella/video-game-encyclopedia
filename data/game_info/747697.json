Like all mazes, some paths have a dead end, but in this game some walls may not be real and you might just be able to go through the 'dead end'. You can also collect vision tokens to activate your vision ability, which temporarily shows you which walls aren't real!<br/><br/><em>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1.
