Make every photo count!</p>\n<p>This game is PC VR only.\u00a0 Developed using the Oculus Quest 2.</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested, here are almost all the videos I have watched while making this game. I see game jams as a great way to learn and build experience, so I hope these videos can help you out if you see a mechanic that you want to implement!\u00a0I am a solo developer and this is my first ever game jam and VR game that I have developed and released.
