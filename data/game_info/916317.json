Fix it (it just needs one inspector tweak).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2714\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Reskin the game by replacing graphics, font, animations, effects, and sounds. Come up with a visually consistent style/theme, eg: claymation, insects, pencil drawn etc\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2714\u00a0 \u00a0 Implement a different kind of bullet that changes the asteroids clearing dynamic (Use new laser by pressing X).</p>\n<p>\u2714 \u2718\u00a0 [HALF DONE] Implement a shield triggered by the \u201cdown\u201d input that makes the ship invulnerable\u00a0and able to destroy asteroids on contact. The shield has an energy that runs out in 2 seconds and takes about 20 seconds to recharge completely. Add a bar on the interface that visualizes the shield energy.</p>\n<p>\u2718\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make the game two player, either competitive or cooperative, by tweaking input mapping, spawn points, and end conditions.</p>\n<p>\u2718\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Add a flying saucer like in this\u00a0implementation. <em><strong>[I am so bad at this game that I couldn't get to the flying saucer part, and so didn't really know how to implement it.]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\u2714\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Delivery: see if you can build it for WebGL and upload it somewhere so it can be played from the browser. Otherwise make a build that runs on your computer.</p>\n<p>_________</p>\n<p>If you are viewing with the restricted link--\u00a0PW: hellogamestudio</p>\n<p>You can go directly here without needing password access with the link: https://vey.itch.io/paper-asteroids?password=hellogamestudio</p>\n<p>Typeface by Camellina.\r\n</p>\n<p>SFX from CC licensed audio samples of paper folding, stapling, flipping pages, etc.</p>\n<p>Experimental game changes\u00a0made for EGS.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T15:31:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/211/211e04102ad290d24d0437972c150be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
