The game is a showcase of a mechanic we developed and is not a complete game.</p>\n<p>The mechanic revolves around shooting two nodes, one coloured yellow and one coloured blue. When both are active, they create a beam of energy that can be used as a platform for greater movement. An additional mechanic is included where connecting both nodes to special platforms will have them move towards each other while they are active.</p>\n<p><strong>Download and run the executable version for the intended build.</strong>\u00a0 We used VFX Graph for the shaders and then learned that WebGL does not support them. The WebGL version uses an older variant of the nodes without the visual effects for those who do not wish to download the executable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/></p>\n<p>Space Bar to jump</p>\n<p>Left mouse to shoot the left (yellow) node</p>\n<p>Right mouse to shoot the right (blue)\u00a0node</p>\n<p>Middle mouse to reset the nodes</p>\n<p>Enter to reset the scene</p>\n<p>Escape (in the PC version) to quit the game</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Hunter Chu - Programmer</p>\n<p>Dhruva Guruprasad - Artist</p>\n<p>Edward Cao - Game Designer\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version History</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>v1.1 (WebGL)</strong> - changed nodes to adjust for lack of VFX</p>\n<p><strong>v1.0 (EXE and WebGL)</strong>\u00a0- initial release</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:44:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7c/b7c618b3c63d130368619bb158b6f998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LightningGrey", "GrayFox0501", "Celestial_Otter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
