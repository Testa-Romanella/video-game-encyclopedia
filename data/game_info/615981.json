The only limitation being we were limited to the free version. Which means we had to complete the entire project using only 50 events.</p>\n<p>The theme for for our jam was Pitfall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team decided to create a de-make of uncharted though our scope during ideation was unrealistic for the amount of events that we had at our disposal. So we ended up going with just a driving shmup in order to re-use as much code as possible.</p>\n<p>This project was created by:</p>\n<p>Nick Pastoria, Timothy Lanthier, and Shubhangi Verma</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T08:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e64dd4c1dda4c51904f5da230f42256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nickPastoria"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
