What will he discover in the end?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theme: Discovery</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: left, right arrows</p>\n<p>Jump: up arrow</p>\n<p>Push down/fall faster: hold down arrow (hint: use this while in mid-air to fall exactly where you want, or on rotating platforms to spin them faster)</p>\n<p>Expand screen: hold spacebar</p>\n<p>Restart level: backspace</p>\n<p>Exit to menu: Escape</p>\n<p>Mute/unmute: click volume icon in top left corner</p><p>Hints:</p>\n<p>Get to the flag to complete the level</p>\n<p>Create momentum while on the ground since you cannot move left or right while in the air under normal circumstances</p>\n<p>Blue platforms are just regular floors, but you can jump off the side of them\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hollow blue platforms are really bouncy</p>\n<p>Brown colored platforms/balls can't be jumped off of. Only left, right, and down arrow keys will work while standing on them</p>\n<p>Brown balls will collide with everything</p>\n<p>Brown platforms will not collide with blue walls</p><p>Known bugs/oddities:</p>\n<p>Sometimes the player just disappears. Not sure why. If that happens just hit the backspace to restart the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the beginning, I had issues with the player flying through platforms, but I haven't seen that for a while.</p>\n<p>The bounce walls can be quite temperamental based on which side of the player's polygon is colliding with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The physics aren't perfect. Sometimes weird things happen and the lil guy will go flying. I see it as more of a fun feature though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music: www.bensound.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:39:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c70a6078c36c088c3ea79c36f5c6f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DashiellR"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
