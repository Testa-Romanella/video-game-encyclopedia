Last time, I joined with a friend. It was an interesting experience to join this Jam alone now. Keeping yourself motivated is definitely harder, than working in a team. I learned a lot about different libGDX features, but also about planning a game (especially time management and leaving features out, you wanted so bad in the game :D) and about working on MIDI tracks.<br/>I definitely will join the next Ludum Dare again, it might be exhausting but also extremely fun. :)</p><p>I am eager to receive your comments and learn from them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db9/db9e10eabf22876ce661c78aacc517f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Skosnowich"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
