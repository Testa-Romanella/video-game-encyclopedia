Your goal is to navigate from the <strong>Starting Page</strong>\u00a0to pages related to the 3 Quests, you can do them in any order, you'll get a notification when you complete a quest and receive an additional 10 steps. Once you've completed all the quests, you must return to the <strong>Starting Page</strong>, however you can never revisit a page you've already visited, so you'll need to plan a way back out of the vortex.</p>\n<p>Note: All Wikipedia content is created by Wikipedia users not by me, please do not judge the content</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/908/9081723909efcb526a1a7f6e435acf63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Impbox Games"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
