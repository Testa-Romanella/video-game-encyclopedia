Think Indiana Jones meets a librarian meets a Warlock. By scouring dark caves and old monuments, the Lorelock offers the revival of these creatures worship in exchange for power! <strong>Collecting </strong>gods and trinkets is all in a days work for the Lorelock.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\u00a0 our friend has found himself in a deep cave without the ability to get home! Delve deeper into the cave to uncover strange and beautiful new places--and perhaps an old god or two to worship.</p>\n<p><strong>Get there and back again,</strong> to jump back out of the hole you fell in.<br/></p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The Lorelock is an old-school inspired metroid-vania featuring dozens of rooms, 10s of secret collectables, and several unlockable powers.
