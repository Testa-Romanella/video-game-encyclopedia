Switch the background from black to white and back again as you jump, dodge, and climb your way to the goal. </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Be careful! Black obstacles are only visible with a white background and vice versa! Time your background changing to weave your way through the obstacles and emerge victorious.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use <em>WASD </em>to move, <em>SPACE </em>to jump, and<em> Q</em>&amp;<em>E</em> to switch the background colour. You can also mute/unmute the audio at any time by pressing <em>M</em> and restart a level if stuck by pressing <em>R</em>.<br/></p>\n<p>This game consists of 20 short levels and can be completed in roughly\u00a0 5-10 minutes. It was built in a single weekend, as a personal game jam.\u00a0 The theme I got was \"Constrast\".\u00a0 I hope you enjoy it and constructive\u00a0 criticism is always welcome.\u00a0 I did the game jam to help learn and get better with Unity, so any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!</p>\n<p>The sounds were generated using an online API called Bfxr. The link for that is below.
