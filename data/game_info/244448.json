Play the downloadable version if this bothers you; and yes, <strong>WebGL sucks</strong>!</em></p>\n<p>Roses are red, violets are blue.<br/>Purple with yellow comes back to red. <br/>Colors are best when live in harmony. <br/></p>\n<p>Balls fight is a colorful top-down shooter submitted to <strong><em>Different Colors game jam</em></strong> with the theme <strong><em>You are the boss of the game</em></strong>. Balls fight features 4 types of enemies that react differently when being killed\u00a0and you have to prioritize shooting them to make the most of it. How far can you push it?</p>\n<p>My interpretation of the theme was a bullet hell where you get to make your own bullet pattern, however it is not very obvious in this game so I\u00a0leave it to your judgement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Original idea was implemented for a 30min mini gamejam called Emofight, which has only 2 types of enemy. A post-jam version of the game with the glow effect can be played with the downloadable labelled _Glow.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bed/beddcc7becfee0c1a8f39b035c6f5e14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Southocean"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
