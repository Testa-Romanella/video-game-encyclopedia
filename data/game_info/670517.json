This new version only allows you to jump by taking away the ability to move. You will already have access to all 10 levels within the menu so feel free to choose any level or play through them all as you like it.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Press the [space] key to jump.</p>\n<p>Press the [escape] key to return to the menu.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>More Info on game N Blank</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game is for\u00a0experimentation on mechanics. Do expect that this game will have controls failing on angles, odd collisions and, mechanics sometimes getting stuck.\r\n</p>\n<p>These levels are easy to finish however if you were to get stuck on a level then you can press the escape key\u00a0to return to the main menu.\r\n</p>\n<p>Any comments on my game, whether it be positive or negative, to help me improve on what I could work harder in the future (or something).\r\n</p>\n<p>Don't expect a game like mine to be fun, I'm sure it wouldn't be entertaining when playing my game. If things don't go as you like it, you can always delete the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/043/043a3ad9d5c7a8500789c8e0457eba9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlankNReady"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
