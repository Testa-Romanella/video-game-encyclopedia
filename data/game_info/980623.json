Unbeknownst to him, his destiny unfolds when he encounters Clock Wise Cat, a revered professor who sees the untapped potential within him. Shadow Cat is welcomed into Clock Wise Cat's academy, a clandestine institution of knowledge and magic hidden from the eyes of the ordinary world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite his prowess, Shadow Cat finds himself isolated from his peers due to his immense power, which instills fear among the other cats. A loner by nature, Shadow Cat delves deep into the ancient tomes of Clock Wise Cat's library where he stumbles upon a book about the Omega-Verse.<br/><br/>Intrigued, Shadow Cat started to learn more about the Omega-Verse theory, a concept believed by ancient wizards that suggests an infinite number of universes exist within the Omega-Verse, each containing alternate versions of oneself.<br/><br/>Fascinated by the concept of parallel universes inhabited by alternate versions of himself, Shadow Cat became consumed by his studies. His ultimate ambition: to unlock the secrets of the Omega-Verse and reunite with other iterations of himself, whom he deems as his true family.<br/> <br/>Through relentless dedication, Shadow Cat starts to experience visions of other worlds and establishes communication with fellow Shadow Cats across the Omega-Verse.  They forge bonds and pledge to unite, vowing to conquer the Omega-Verse together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Years pass, and Shadow Cat ascends into adulthood, assuming leadership of a faction known as the Cats In Black. Harnessing his magical prowess and understanding of the Omega-Verse, Shadow Cat collaborated with Top Hat Rat Technology to construct a network of quantum computers, enabling interdimensional transit.<br/> <br/>The completion of the device heralds a new era of exploration, as Shadow Cat pioneers communication between universes via this technology. However, despite advancements, attempts to transport organic life result in catastrophic failure, with subjects succumbing to fatal tumors upon arrival.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Top Hat Rat, overseeing Omega-Verse operations, harbors ambitions of traversing dimensions for resource extraction, driven by scarcity in his own universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After countless trials, a breakthrough emerged when a single mouse defied the odds, surviving the interdimensional journey. Dubbed \"Omega Mouse,\" it became the focal point of reseach and experimentation by the Cats In Black throughout the Omega-Verse.<br/> <br/>Amidst the frenzy of their endeavors, Shadow Cat had a stunning revelation.  It became clear to him that within the vast expanse of the Omega-Verse, where infinite possibilities lay, there must be a universe where Omega Mouse is more powerful than him - a universe where Omega Mouse reached it's prime.<br/><br/>With it's inherent power of interdimensional travel, Shadow Cat knows it's only a matter of time before Omega Mouse Prime shows up seeking retribution against him and his allies for their many crimes against mice across the Omega-Verse.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T08:44:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d915cfaba272ae1ad07d306f43a1fd.jpg", "website": "http://www.omegamousezero.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OMEGABYTE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["OMEGABYTE"], "esrb_rating": null}
