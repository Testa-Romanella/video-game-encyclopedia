{"id": 601984, "slug": "regression-lewisjones30", "name": "Regression (LewisJones30)", "name_original": "Regression (LewisJones30)", "description": "<p>Welcome to Regression - A game where you progress by going backwards.</p>\n<p>The basic premise of Regression is that you start off with lots of powers - ranging from double damage, to a chance to rain projectiles on your enemies. As you fight through the ten waves of enemies, you will start to lose these powers. By the end of the game, you will be left with minimal powers to what you started with. Can you get to the end of Regression?<br/></p>\n<p>There are bonus points on offer at the end of each wave (Easy, Normal difficulties only) for choosing the stronger powers, so strategy is key to reaching the end.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>Four difficulties to choose from - Easy, Normal, Hard and Expert. Each has their own unique twist. You might not be able to choose the powers you lose!</li><li>Leaderboards - Four leaderboards for each difficulty. Saved locally, you can also add your name!</li><li>Custom soundtrack - I have created four audio tracks which are played throughout the game to enhance the immersiveness of the game.</li><li>Two weapons to choose from - The staff lets you shoot projectiles from far away and the mace lets you deal massive amounts of damage close by, and take less damage overall as well, but it requires you to be a lot closer to your enemies!</li><li>Fully operational pause menu - In this menu you can see your current progress, as well as a breakdown of all the powers - both available and unavailable - and what they do!</li><li>Tutorial - A small tutorial when you first start playing Regression will explain the basic premise above, as well as allow you to drain your first power.</li><li>Day/Night cycle - Utilising the power of Unistorm's weather system - a full day/night cycle based on the system clock is used. Depending on the time of day you play Regression, it might be dark in the game too!</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move. Use mouse to rotate camera, as well as navigate the main menu and in-game menu.</p>\n<p>Hold Left Shift to sprint. You move a lot faster, but your weapons will not recharge while you are charging!</p>\n<p>Full acknowledgements for all assets and software used will be included within the ZIP folder.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>Some sounds may cut out prematurely if the enemy animation is not played properly.</p>\n<p>The mega troll's death count will always cut out slightly prematurely.</p>\n<p>The weapon recharging text is hard to see in the tutorial.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about Regression, feel free to contact me:</p>\n<p>Email:\u00a0lewis.jones99@outlook.com</p>\n<p>LinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-jonesgd/</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/LewisJGamesDev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:59:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/25495fcc0f590ee57cce4ba3f75da2e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LewisJones30"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
