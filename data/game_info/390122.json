You awake on a beautiful island and have three days to complete various quests. Some are outlined on your map; others are secret and must be discovered through exploration.</p>\n<p>Wander round and drink in the beautiful environment, whilst listening to the haunting ambience. Ambient shrines will change the soundtrack and provide a different mood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0WASD<br/></p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Sprint:\u00a0Shift</p>\n<p>Interact: Mouse 1</p>\n\n<p>HUD: H</p>\n<p>Map:\u00a0M</p>\n<p>Quit:\u00a0Esc</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developers Note</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is far from perfect and is not particularly well optimised. It may also have numerous graphical bugs and things that don't work perfectly. For practical reasons, it is also locked to 1024x768 (anything beyond that turned into a slideshow and even at this resolution, it's still not 60FPS consistently - you can enter full screen mode by pressing Alt-Enter).</p>\n<p>The reason this game lacks finesse and optimisation\u00a0is because it was made as part of a 24-hour challenge. I challenged myself to design, develop and release a game in 24 hours (not in one sitting). The entire process can be viewed on my Twitch channel and a blog of the process can be found in my\u00a0Discord server.</p>\n<p>Hopefully it will be a relaxing and enjoyable experience for you, even if it is more of a prototype than anything else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Developed by\u00a0<em>Persephone's Chair</em></p>\n<p>Lead Programmer &amp;\u00a0Design:\u00a0Ben Lathbury</p>\n<p>Title: Sean Haddick</p>\n<p>Tools Used:\u00a0Gaia Pro, GeNa 2, CTS 2019, Ambient Skies, PathPainter, AQUAS 2020, Aura 2, Enviro, Vegetation Studio</p>\n<p>Made with Unity Engine (in 24 hours)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd4c28bec048103a53569883a5514ff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Persephone's Chair"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
