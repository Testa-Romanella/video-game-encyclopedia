A single night intrusion into Fyn's life and hopes. Tired of the last two years she spent wandering without a goal and without memories, among disenchanted strangers, and pitiless scavengers, Fyn decided to put an end to all of this. She'll have a few hours to make things right, and seek strong, pure and substantial memories. In a city where genders and species melt into each other, maybe she'll find the long lost touch of humanity missing from her life.\r\n<p>\r\n\tFeatures:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A non-linear adventure in 6 acts (3 episodes)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Each act can end in several ways (different puzzles, different stories)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Surreal atmosphere inspired by Philip.K.Dick, William Gibson, David Cronenberg, Shinya Tsukamoto and Gregg Araki</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Your actions may affect the world around you</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A not so subtle mix between good old point and click features and a totally fucked up story!</li>\n</ul>\r\n\r\nFull season available on Itchio.<br/>\r\n\r\nEPISODE 2 OUT NOW!\r\n<p>\n<strong>Episode 3 will be released in 2018.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official website: voidandmeddler.com\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOST by Red City Noise and Waveland, get it on \r\n\tBandcamp!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The idea behind Void &amp; Meddler was to create a game that looks like its creators, two musicians nurtured by noise rock from the 80's, synthwave, road trips and cyberpunk literature. Together, we conjured the narration, we created No Wave, we tamed the weird, we fucked in an orgy of wires, neons and white noise. Distance doesn't corrupt anything. Amps were set aside for a while, and we dived head first into another sphere we loved, full of code, textures and pixel art.<br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enjoy Void &amp; Meddler, an indie adventure game full of fuzz literature, pixel music and analog dreams.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed400d72e724940e169a660d46f7b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dorian SRed"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
