Version S", "description": "<p><em>Clash!</em>\u00a0was a game made to supplement my senior project in late 2015, exploring video game development as a rising artistic medium and as a culmination of various forms of storytelling and artistic expression. Due to the time constraints involved and the limitations of Scratch, the game\u00a0still has many glitches and bugs, which I currently have no plans to fix. However, I plan to build a new version of\u00a0<em>Clash!</em>\u00a0one day with another language and engine more suitable for gaming and sharing, with more fighters, stages, and possibly a story mode.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Credits, controls, and additional information can be found on my website:\u00a0Clash!
