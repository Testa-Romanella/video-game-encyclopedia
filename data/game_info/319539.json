If they ever all land on skulls, you will die.</p>\n<p>Everything's by me, but the music is my arrangement of a piece by Max Richter called On the Nature of Daylight.</p>\n<p>According to a report by the UK Department for Transport in 2013, there are 5.6 road fatalities per 1 billion kilometres driven. Crunch some numbers, and that comes to about a 1 in 135 million chance of dying for each kilometre driven.</p>\n<p>This means for each kilometre driven, you flip 27 theoretical coins. If they all land on tails, you die.</p>\n<p>While these odds are hugely unlikely, I spend a lot of time sitting in cars worrying about the coins, being tossed again and again. It'll likely never happen to me, but the fear's irrational and not so easily placated.</p>\n<p>This game is an illustration of that fear. I guess it's optimistic at heart; it would probably take\u00a0562500 hours of cumulative playtime for anyone to see the ending. But the ending does exist, and it is possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T04:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12a/12a68ed23d090b06f3215d05f75dd804.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hannah Rose"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
