After discovering the identity and intentions of Delilah, the leader of the Brigmore Witch coven, you set out to disrupt her from completing a powerful ritual that will spell your doom. Having already been betrayed by your lieutenant, Billie Lurk, you must rely on feuding gang factions-the Dead Eels and the Hatters-to negotiate your way through previously unseen districts of Dunwall en route to Delilah&#39;s stronghold. Regardless of the way you reach your destination, one thing is for certain - you will finally answer for your treacherous actions and fall before the mercy, or punishment, of the Royal Bodyguard and Assassin, Corvo Attano. Additionally, your power, weapon and item upgrades, Chaos level, and player actions from The Knife of Dunwall will carry over via a compatible save file option.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2013-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T14:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/e7d/e7d6791ee5969a8d7736f3e7cf8a20cd.jpg", "website": "http://www.dishonored.com/#/dlc", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 35, "beaten": 200, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 153, "suggestions_count": 637, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 157, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Arkane Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
