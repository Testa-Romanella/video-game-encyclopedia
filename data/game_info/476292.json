I hope I can fix this problems in the future.</p>\n<p>PS2: Seeing as this is kinda of a alpha version, please submit your criticism in the comments so I can use for reference when working on it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3213715fc411bcc7b40149cc16373e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Waldomiro Rom\u00e3o"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
