There are many closed off rooms you may find yourself in. If you ever seem stuck, you can always press z to dig straight through the floor. This will leave a chute behind. An entombed start is still winnable through digging and judicious item usage. You may want to carry around a floater for emergencies.\u00a0The monsters are very dumb.<br/></p>\n<p>Like many great works of art, this game was made for bonus points.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f61/f610100a3aed85a11bf401c2964cf786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Rhodes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
