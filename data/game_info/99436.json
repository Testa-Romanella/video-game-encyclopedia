Please leave your comments in the Feedback thread below.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to test a new locomotion system. You need to move your hands like your're running. We found it was fun and built a store with aliens AI wandering around and taking piles of various items. It's a score-based game, but to satisfy the judges at the end, you need to complete somes objectives on your errand list.</p>\n<p><strong>** You need a HTC Vive to play this game! **</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>HOLD\u00a0GRIPS AND MIMIC RUNNING WITH YOUR ARMS TO MOVE</p>\n<p>LEFT TOUCHPAD CLICK - Open/Close shopping list</p>\n<p>RIGHT TOUCHPAD CLICK - Open/Close shopping bag</p>\n<p>TRIGGERS - Grab objects in hands</p>\n<p>You need to restart the game to start over (we'll fix that soon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dff/dffdbec33bcf25c7fb5f4c514d4c6871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trebuchet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
