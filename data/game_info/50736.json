{"id": 50736, "slug": "soulcalibur-vi", "name": "SoulCalibur VI", "name_original": "SoulCalibur VI", "description": "<p>Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There&#39;s also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>The game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T00:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/91b/91be1a00c767f9e3d79353e505d7f85a.jpg", "website": "https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/soulcalibur-vi", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 117, "owned": 1740, "beaten": 82, "toplay": 74, "dropped": 111, "playing": 45}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 70, "ratings_count": 214, "suggestions_count": 703, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 215, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America", "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "NAMCO"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
