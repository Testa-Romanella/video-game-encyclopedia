Each time you clear a wave with your antimatter rounds, it causes ripples. Through these ripples more shots can come out of your gun, asteroids can move precariously fast, and it gets oh so very dangerous. Good luck pilot, we probably won't be seeing you again.</p>\n<p><em>Royalty free music from https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</em> was used in this project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f601c0900c033dcf93b5bb3b1476ae86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrBeardie"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
