There will be different columns placed in a circular way, an elevated atrium where the boss will be and different stone remains of other constructions scattered around the stage, all this so that it can be used as cover.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-08T05:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a1/5a1758a6ba85c3beafec838a54df6129.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leonidas199747"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
