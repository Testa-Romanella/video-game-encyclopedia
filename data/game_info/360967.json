Solve some colour shenanigans, navigate the limited space and bend the dimension using mirrors. That may sound crazy, but it makes for some interesting problems.\u00a0Solve 14 stages, then get one of two endings. The game explores trust, blindness and the importance of grey area, but for all of that, you'll need to see both endings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Game should work with joystick controls and B to reset, but not tested. Keyboard controls: WASD and Arrows. The game must be run at\u00a0an aspect ratio of 16:9.*</p>\n<p>Game made for the GMTK 2019 Jam, in just 48 hours. The theme was 'only one', wherein the game uses only one dimension, with each level on one screen.\u00a0The music was made by Devast8, and everything else by JUSTCAMH.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T20:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da9afd90b37c7a80b8f29455e7254553.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JUSTCAMH"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
