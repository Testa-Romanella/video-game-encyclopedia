The game is only for Oculus at the moment and uses Oculus Touch controllers for the inputs.<br/><br/>To play the game, the user has to hover over a lever knob with their Oculus controller and squeeze the hand trigger button to grab it. They then have to move the lever all the way until they feel the lever cannot move anymore. After figuring out the puzzle the user may press the 'B' or 'Y' buttons on the controller to exit the game.<br/><br/>VR Mirror Puzzle was created in Unity as a short side project to immerse myself more into VR development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc535f741f40f119ae9d3ca5f6293c3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["venilor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
