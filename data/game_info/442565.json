It is still in active development with no release window as of yet. I am the only person developing it, and I am still a rather new developer, so it is still unpolished.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The downloadable demo preview features:</p>\n<ul><li>Two levels</li><li>No enemies</li><li>Unity HDRP graphics</li><li>Silent Hill-inspired gameplay</li></ul>\n<p>Note: because of the High Definition Render Pipeline, system requirements may be rather high, and the game might refuse to run or run incorrectly on weaker machines.</p><p>NOTE 2: due to unforeseen circumstances (lack of proper testing), the game is prone to gamebreaking bugs and lack of proper player guidance. I will release a fixed version eventually.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T05:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bd3e5d62bd9fd2df9292016999bf24e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T-ReXx"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
