Well, they eventually end up in the outer reaches of the asteroid belt, and that's where you, Tardigrade, come in. You are an extremophile wandering the cosmos looking for your favourite food, which fortuitously is the Quality Street toffee penny...</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Collect the toffee pennies before the air runs out. Flip levers to open pathways. Go to the exit. 20 levels. You bounce off walls, but are killed by spikes and baddies. Your score is entirely based on the air bonus. Once you collect the final toffee penny, the air depletes faster, so bear that in mind.</p>\n<p>It's a hard game, so if you can complete it with about\u00a030 fails, you can consider yourself a master.</p>\n<p>Keys: OPZ, QWM, or Kempston.</p>\n<p>16K Spectrum and above.</p>\n<p>Written for the Cassette 16 Summer Jam 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T04:13:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef1/ef1cbe631a351782cb4974dd10da87fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StonechatProductions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
