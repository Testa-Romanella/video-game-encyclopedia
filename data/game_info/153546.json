Use arrow keys to move around, interact and change dialog.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a game I created about a Day in the Life of my sister from my perspective. It touches on some of the issues she faces and was\u00a0part of a present (a little belated) for her birthday. She has allowed me to upload for all to see. Step into her shoes and take a walk in this little adventure game created in Bitsy.\r\n  </p>\n<p>My sister lives with multiple chronic illness and this game looks mostly at her diabetes. I wanted to create a game for her, something special and a bit different for a birthday present. It has a few in jokes, some education and I tried to make it a little quirky.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Its not easy living with a chronic illness and even harder with multiple. Diabetes is a very big topic with a lot of misconceptions surrounding it. I touch on some of these misconceptions and prejudices in the game. Some of these are simply old ideas that have continued to be propagated through miscommunication and a lack of information or updated knowledge.   </p>\n<p>This little adventure will be a bit educational and a bit silly, so enjoy and I hope to be creating some more little games soon.\r\n  </p>\n<p>From Miffical Dragon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c11d033e3ea5c9a7bacd6986381fd25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MifficalDragon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
