Reason for that is written in the notice section.</p><p>Starlight Chemistry is a 2D linear platformer with light exploration and shooter elements. You play as a forest guardian named Kerry who tries to stop another guardian from bringing the whole ecosystem to a halt.</p>\n<p>Notice: This was my first attempt at making a complete game. Unfortunately upon exporting through Processing 3, the game is unbeatable due to a low memory limit and the game freezes upon going through around 4 load states. I am not able to figure out the cause of this due to many factors: physics engine not clearing up memory properly, audio engine not clearing up memory properly, or my code is poorly written. As of right now, this game will remain unbeatable unless it's just my computer that is experiencing this freeze up. You can still try the first couple of levels, that is until you stay at a black screen during loading. While it's not really a crash and more of a soft freeze (there is no \"not responding\" messages and you can easily alt-tab out and close app), please play at your own risk!</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE READ NOTICE BEFORE DOWNLOADING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T06:43:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e7dd2ba84c67b7a30ab928a8061f6c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChobBri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
