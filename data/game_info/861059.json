As she enters Poe Middle School however, she realizes something strange is going on.<br/></p>\n<p>--------<br/></p>\n<p>This is a project created for the Spooktober 4th Annual Visual Novel game jam to bring a special treat for people during Halloween. Middle School School Monster Party is unfortunately in prototype stage. The idea was (and still is) to do more, but seeing as jams have deadlines I have posted it in it's current build.</p>\n<p>While the game is playable in browser, it's not ideal unless you have speedy internet.
