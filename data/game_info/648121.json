FORG wants all the love FORG can get, but they do not want to be touched.\u00a0 I certainly know THAT feeling.<br/></p>\n<p>Simply reach the heart on each screen, then bring it back to the door. Easy right? But once FORG starts moving they will not stop until they hit a wall. Also those creatures all want to give FORG a big hug. NO TOUCH PLS!</p>\n<p>Guide FORG through 17 screens across 3 areas. But beware, love is hard work...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls::</strong><br/>Z = Left<br/>X = Right<br/>P = Pause</p>\n<p>You can also redefine the keys to your liking.
