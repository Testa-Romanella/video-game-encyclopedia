Follow the instructions to find out how. Other than that, this was a little project I've been working on for a couple of days, and I wanted to release it to see if anyone was interested. Have fun.</p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p>Alright, so when you press play, you start in a level. Then you have a certain amount of time to get to the finish line. THE LEVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE. The point of the game is to impress people when they can't finish the level. But, this is the cool part, in the lose or win screen, if you press the number \"1\" on your keyboard. It will trigger a recording of me beating the level, and you will have to pretend to press the keys to fool the person into thinking that it is your gameplay.\u00a0 I recommend practicing beforehand to try to get the hang of it. Hopefully, that made sense, good luck.</p>\r\nControls :\r\n<p>A S D - Move around</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>1 - Trigger recording (Only in Win/Lose Screen)</p>\r\nFinal Notes:\r\n<p>A was curious if a game like this would work out so I wanted to test it out. I don't have anyone to test it on so it's up to you to let me know. Good luck and comment on what happens!</p>\r\nVideo :\r\n\r\n<p>* READ HOW TO PLAY SECTION *<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/85184e9a63ffef5b9d94ccc09f8edc84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jumbo Jump"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
