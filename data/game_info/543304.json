These sections are clearly marked and the player is able to skip them by choosing the path that leads outside the cave to the sun.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Additional Themes that may cause distress:<br/>- Descriptions of sleep paralysis, including a realistic nightmare\u00a0<br/>- Unreality and dissociation moments where the player is not sure which way to go to the exit and loss of their\u00a0playable avatar. (Right arrows indicate to press the right key to continue to the next dialogue in these cases)</p>\n\n<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br/>This bitsy game is a visual essay about\u00a0when I pursued my childhood dream of becoming an animator and all of the hardships and joy that came with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong>Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to move your light bulb avatar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HINTS:\u00a0</strong><br/>Look for flashing sprites to continue to the next section (usually this is shown as an arrow, but sometimes it may be other pictures). You can talk to sprites by bumping into them with the arrow keys.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>DEV NOTES:</strong><br/>I made this game during another dark period in my life as a way to reflect on where I've been and where I'd like to go next. I encourage anyone who's also having dark thoughts to reach out to the people you love. If you don't have anyone to talk to, you can always call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 which is available 24/7. You can also find more information and additional resources on their website:\u00a0https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org. <br/><br/>To all of you who are in the darkness.\u00a0Stay strong. You're a survivor too. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:41:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/199/1992c687abfd2fceb8010b522eb31dfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BubblyOasis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
