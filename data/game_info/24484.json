The plankton begin as eggs and gradually grow, \n      emitting light and fascinating sounds throughout their entire life \n      cycle. The sounds they make change as they grow from infancy to \n      maturity, growing very quickly until they disappear completely. \n      Sun-Animalcule plankton only emerge in the morning, noon, and evening. \n      Sun-Animalcule plankton lose strength as the night wears on; that is \n      when the crescent-shaped Falcato plankton take their place. The pitch of \n      the plankton changes depending on where they grow.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d0d503feda5d572039dbc251e0a746b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
