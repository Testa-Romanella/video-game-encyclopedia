Your first stop: a small village in Romania, where rumour has it that\u00a0the castle ruins are none other than the home of the Count Dracula himself. Will you be able to uncover the veil of mystery and save the locals from the vampiric curse?</p>\n<p>A 3D\u00a0horror adventure with comedic twist, this game was\u00a0made possible thanks to the effort of no less than 13 people who worked together for a month as a team.</p>\n<p>The game demo is free to download- and expect it to be worth it. We tried our best\u00a0to polish it in time for the needs of\u00a0the Game Jam Off 2022 by Github, so that any player can give it a try and have a pleasant experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sounds and music in particular\u00a0are just marvellous; it was not in vain that we had not one, not two, but<em> three</em>\u00a0amazing sound designers.\u00a0 Also our 3d artists are really great and the models look just great, even greater than usual thanks to the works of our 2d artists making the game more appealing to the human eye. The story is crafted with the upmost care by our writer, who has a prodigious mind, and a great way of directing (and also helping) our two talented to say the least voice artists.</p>\n<p>Creating this game was a pleasant experience for all of us, and we are proud to present our finished demo. There are many more things we would like to add in the future, but we are sure you will enjoy what we have so far. And if you do, we would be happy to hear from you!</p>\n\n<p>Our Team</p>\n<p>Programmer / Lead PM / Level-Game Designer -\u00a0Enric \"Cordar\" Mir</p>\n<p>Sound Designer / Lead Technical Sound Designer -\u00a0Alexander Hamparsomian</p>\n<p>Sound Designer / Lead Composer -\u00a0Holger Fritzsche (Get Your Beat)</p>\n<p>Sound Designer /Technical Sound Designer -\u00a0Cameron Ardon</p>\n<p>3D Modeling -\u00a0Joe Joe (CrackedDome)</p>\n<p>3D Artist -\u00a0Alex Puche</p>\n<p>2D Artist / UI/UX Designer -\u00a0Veronica Ruiz (Lunavel)</p>\n<p>2D Artist -\u00a0Pyro</p>\n<p>Script, VA, VA Director -\u00a0momochan</p>\n<p>VA -\u00a0fumbookitz</p>\n<p>VA -\u00a0DoctorJimalicious</p>\n<p>Game Designer -\u00a0Luis Caballero</p>\n<p>PM / UI Developer -\u00a0Ashby Glover</p>\n<p>\"Die SpielUhr\" (Menu), \"Auchindoun\" (Book) -\u00a0Michael Deutschmann (Drachenflug)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:00:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/6479dbc2e52731f7756188c5929fb074.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SoundChemist", "Cordar23", "rockconnaisance", "CameronArdon", "GetYourBeat", "momo_chan_writes", "Cracked Dome", "Lucavi92", "Lunavel", "DoctorJimalicious"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
