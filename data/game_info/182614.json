Your objective is to get out. But initially, there is no exit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls and navigation:</strong></p>\n<p>You can walk on walls and ceiling - all directions are relative. But that is not enough: to escape the cube,\u00a0you must\u00a0\u00a0change an arrangement of its walls. You can do that by rotating faces of a 3d minimap of the cube-world that you hold in your right hand. To rotate the face of a 3D minimap cube and with it, the face of the cube you are stuck in\u00a0 put the <strong>yellow cursor attached to your left hand into the face of the cube</strong>,\u00a0and <strong>squeeze the left Oculus Touch index finger trigger</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Orientation:</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, the interactive 3D minimap indicates your position (you are represented as\u00a0the yellow capsule) in the cube system and the location of passages leading to other cube rooms. If the passage is red, it is blocked. If it is green, it is opened. To open a blocked passage, rotate the cube's face so that two passages align with each other, thus becoming passable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that this is an <strong>emergent game system with procedurally generated levels.</strong> For now, it is entirely possible that the level generated for you is impossible to complete (e.g. there is no passage into the exit cube). If that happens, restart the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Review:</strong></p>\n<p>Once you are done playing, please fill up the playtesting survey - it will help us develop the game:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd62qX9BLUI99Y6CPONkl0CY3Nl_0bCPLSeyiOwGq0SCJls2A/viewform?usp=sf_link</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f461233b44f78bda8637b1ea62b80b7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Student Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
