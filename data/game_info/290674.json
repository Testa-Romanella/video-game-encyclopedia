{"id": 290674, "slug": "my-tactical-rpg-prototype", "name": "My Tactical RPG Prototype", "name_original": "My Tactical RPG Prototype", "description": "<p>This is a simple prototype for a tactical RPG idea I had. It's a party based RPG, similar to Final Fantasy and Dragon Age. You can walk around freely or use the mouse cursor to move your party members. Likewise you can move the camera around the character when holding down the right mouse button, zooming in and out using the scroll wheel. You can attack an enemy by right clicking on him, or try an ability using any of the number buttons on top.\u00a0<br/><br/>A feature that is completely flawed and buggy right now, is the tactics system I'm trying to implement. When it works properly, it allows you to easily create simple AI programming blocks for your party members to engage. It should only work on allies that you aren't directly controlling. Press B to toggle the menu, and try it out for yourself. The save data for these are stored in your Local Appdata folder, similar to many Unity games. Interesting enough, the enemies also use the same tactics system, which you can see in the tactics XML file. This system is completely buggy right now, and it's often for enemies and allies to not follow their AI pattern properly. <br/><br/>This is a simple prototype for a reason. It's a buggy mess, with placeholder assets that I plan to replace in the future.
