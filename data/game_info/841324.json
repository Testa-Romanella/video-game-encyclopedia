Your flying depends on your shooting because hitting any target will regenerate your launching ability, which you have only one charge of. <br/></p>\n<p>The mechanic is kinda complicated to explain but when you master it, the movement becomes fluid and combat becomes very energetic and fun.<br/><br/>There is only one enemy at the moment and the goal of this demo is to collect feedback on the movement and the idea in general. The project is WIP and will continue to grow.<br/><br/>I'm very excited to see your feedback as it is the first serious project I'm working on!<br/><br/>Credits to Daniel Darko for a ninja model<br/>Credits to twistedc3 for a bow and arrow model<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T09:31:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cff9f5a5c1c44d6bbfa0bb50b35e1ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["idSynth"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
