A big part of it was script inheritance. This would make it so when I wanted to make another character from the Overwatch universe, it would be a lot simpler. I also created a few static scripts, that can be used by multiple characters, in this instance, the explosion for Junkrat's various weapons can be translated onto other characters.</p><p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Left Shift: Throw Concussion Mine\r\n</p>\n<p>E: Throw Trap\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button: Shoot grenade\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button: Explode Concussion mine\r\n</p>\n<p>Q: RIPTire\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T08:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69b/69bc46d4e54fff2d58fcc60138fbc217.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Bird"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
