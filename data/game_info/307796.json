This fallacy, which is related to\u00a0</em><em>loss aversion</em><em>\u00a0and\u00a0</em><em>status quo bias</em><em>, can also be viewed as bias resulting from an ongoing\u00a0commitment.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the costs outweigh the benefits, the extra costs incurred are held in a different\u00a0mental account\u00a0than the one associated with the ticket transaction. <br/>For example, individuals sometimes order too much food and then over-eat just to \u201cget their money\u2019s worth\u201d.\u00a0 Similarly, a person may have a $20 ticket to a concert and then drive for hours through a blizzard, just because she feels that she has to attend due to having made the initial investment.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>HOW DOES THE SUNK COST FALLACY RELATE TO ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS?</strong><br/><em>Researchers have found that people cling\u00a0on to\u00a0unhappy\u00a0relationships\u00a0because of the sunk cost fallacy.</em></p>\n<p><em>For instance, </em><em>a\u00a0study involving over 900 people</em><em> by researchers at the University of Minho in Braga, Portugal, shows that the more effort is invested in a relationship, the more the potential victim will commit to that relationship.</em><br/><em>\"</em>Experiments confirmed the initial hypothesis that investments in terms of time, effort and money make individuals more prone to stay and invest in a relationship in which they are unhappy<em>\" the researchers concluded.</em></p>\r\n*\r\n+INFO\r\n<p><em><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>Isaque Sanches, Jo\u00e3o Costa, Jo\u00e3o Ribeiro, Tiago Marques.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>INPUT<br/></strong>Mouse Click</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T05:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cd59f7cdfd3a23a362bf432268b3cc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Isaque Sanches", "Tiago Marques"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
