We represented schizophrenia through our sound to give a hallucinogenic sound effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes dealing with mental health\u00a0feels like you are climbing a mountain which we show in our rocky game texture. The struggle also can feel like you are going back and forth which is why we developed the game to have this feeling with the mechanic of falling back to an earlier point in the level if you fail a jump.</p>\n\n<p>To play the game download the zip file then extract it on to your computer.</p>\n<p>Then run the application called RaiseTheGameJam</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Click the left mouse button to jump</p>\n<p>The distance between the mouse and the ball determines the length of the jump (this is shown with a gauge)</p>\n\n<p>Aim</p>\n<p>Try and get to the end of the level, if you fall you\u00a0 will have to make your way back up to where you started. Try not to let the background sound distract you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a4/9a431448ecc7472542cc477d38f83340.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioMambos"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
