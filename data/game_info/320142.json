{"id": 320142, "slug": "cats-alone-at-home", "name": "Cats Alone at Home", "name_original": "Cats Alone at Home", "description": "<p>This is a classic tower defence game involving cats vs dogs with a very simple design which we will later improve to add a lot more detail. Currently in the alpha version we have one level with pre determined positions for towers which once clicked will use 60 gold coins to place a tower which shoots enemies. The enemies are dogs although it may be hard to tell in the alpha as we have not yet developed detailed sprites. The dogs follow a pre-set path to the other end and if they are not killed will lower the players HP. Try to survive the incoming waves of dogs and defend your home.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/748ce26335fe7ba5192dd3141aacab5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheDefenders"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
