I am 13 so it will take a while for me to make it. You do not need anything to download this game except the file of course:)</p><p>IMPORTANT: For some unknown reason all of the games I have been working on have deleted fro my computer I have also lost my 3d models, my code, and my sounds, I will no longer be able to update the following: The Beta Batch series, Silent Screams, and Project X. This is a major setback but I am working on a 2d platformer and I will try to continue with games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/254/25486c820031f76029bd1483877dffb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kobe Barnes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
