It is a trial project I made in 2015 to improve myself. I found it in my archive and wanted to share it with you. I do not think to develop the project, I do not think it is a project to be developed anyway, but if you want the game to progress and develop, I will be listening to you in the comments.<br/><br/>NOTE: Features shown in the project may not be working. As I mentioned in the \"History\" section, it is only a trial project and it is likely to have many problems.<br/><br/>(The project was developed with the Unity game engine. It was built from Unity 5.6.2.)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay and Features</strong><br/>WASD - Walking Keys<br/>Mouse Sol - Fire<br/>Right Mouse - Aim</p>\n<p>Q - Weapon Customization (Can be used in the game, but not included in the terrorist team, i.e. team 2)</p>\n<p>CTRL - Lie on the ground<br/>C - Crouch</p>\n<p>Key 1 - Choose a weapon (Forward)<br/>Key 2 - Choose a weapon (Back)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaa/eaa9838dcba31c0fceffeff22d417f04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rakarnov"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
