This new game is a mini-sequel to the older games developed by the Ages Team. As the 3rd game was canceled due to loss of motivation, we moved on to Sonic stuff, and now we\u2019re moving on again, and here we have an awesome short game you\u2019ll never forget!</p>\n<p>This game is kind of short. It\u2019s just boss fights, but there is good quality in it, and the ending will shock you\u2026</p>\r\nWatch the trailer:\r\n\r\n<p>Plot:</p>\n<p>After the events of Kevin &amp; Friends - Video Game 2 (original), Kevin sent Trixie and Marvin to Sin City, a lawless, crude, creepy place where there are no rules at all. Trixie and Marvin have managed to escape by using a 3rd-Party red ring. When they returned to Earth, they kidnapped Mariela. Kevin got snapped and chases Mariela as she flies off into outer space. When Mariela is dragged into Trixie\u2019s homebase, the final fight between Kevin and the evil villains will change their lives once again.\r\n</p><p>~</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<ul><li>As usual, arrow keys to move the character around.\r\n</li><li>A to jump.\r\n</li><li>S to shoot. You may also use left, right, or up to aim multiple directions.\r\n</li><li>To use boost, hold D to charge up, and then release to dominate the entire screen.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thank you to all of the Ages Team staff who worked on this amazing project! We appreciate all of you for your hard work of programming, animation, and so much more! Don\u2019t let your dream die, keep on going!\r\n</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>#action #adventure #platformer #arcade #retro #roguelike #survival #shooter #strategy #altgame #analog #kevinandfriends #textadventure #scifi<br/></p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T16:53:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c46/c46a8f08323641c73abe9ca7cef723ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["\ud835\udcdf\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf9\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcec\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcf205"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
