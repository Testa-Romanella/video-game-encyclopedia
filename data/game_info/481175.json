I'm currently deciding whether to pursue the project further or not but I would also like to review the technology used to create this first version.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>The game is controlled using a mouse and keyboard combination. The vehicle driving<br/>is done using WASD to move and turn, and the middle mouse button pressed pans the view of the carrier, the carrier turret and map.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/443161d49ec5cfacf49f23b481f44920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hairein"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
