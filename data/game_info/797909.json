Their lives sure seem great from the outside! Sleep in, play with toys, chase squirrels, and bark at cats while never having to work a day or pay a penny of taxes in their entire life! But, have you ever wondered why they tremble in fear at the shock of loud booms and crashes, force their hackles up and yelp uncontrollably at unsuspected visitors, or cower in utter terror when reprimanded by their owner? Not all dogs' live the lives we see on the outside.<br/><br/>Play from the perspective of a small, innocent Jack-Russel Terrier living in an abusive household. Maintain your needs and desires to <strong>bark, sniff, chase,</strong> and <strong>find treats,</strong> as you try desperately to <strong>escape the house</strong> in which you have been forced to call home.<h3>The Abilities</h3><strong>Barking</strong><br/>Take full, careful control of your barking and loudly--but cautiously--scare the cats and squirrels in your near surroundings. Be warned, however, your owner doesn't much care for your woof-ing ways. <strong>Barking awards points. You make significant noise when barking Barking causes owner agitation when in close proximity.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Sensing</strong><br/>Tap into your special sixth doggy sense and <strong>see the aura</strong> of all things you could possibly need. Use 'Sense' mode to view the aura of <strong>guidance</strong> and <strong>danger.</strong> You will automatically start <strong>chasing</strong> after anyone or anything who runs away from your presence, and who doesn't love a good chase? Be warned though, sensing takes a lot of effort. <strong>Chasing and marking your territory on select spots award points. You cannot bark when sensing. You make more noise when sensing.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Running and Hiding</strong><br/>Your are not a fighter, just a poor little pound pup in a very unsafe environment. Hiding is always the safest solution to danger. You may run fast, but the threats in your life are pretty smart. Stay low and stay quiet. If they can't hear or see you, you might just get away. <strong>You make more noise when running.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Points</strong><br/>You are awarded points when successfully barking at or holding a chase with a cat or squirrel, evading threats, marking your territory, and collecting treats. At the end of each section if enough points have been collected, you will be awarded with various boosts to your doggy abilities, making the stresses of your little doggie life just a little easier to manage.<h3>The Threats</h3><strong>Your Owner</strong><br/>You know your owner pretty well, and you know that he doesn't treat you very well. His abuse has led you to escape at the next opportunity you get, but you know he won't make that easy. Until you finally catch your big break, stay low and stay quiet. Your owner gets really agitated by your barking in the night, and if you bark too loud too often, he will come find you. He has a good ear and even better eye. Stay quiet and stay hidden as necessary to avoid the abuse and trauma that is yet to come.<br/><br/><strong>Big Dogs</strong><br/>You may be mighty and fierce, but the bigger dogs around the neighborhood will tear you apart without a second thought. These dogs aren't evoked by your presence, but getting too close or engaging in any act they may deem as challenging will only lead to your demise. Tread carefully when encountering the beasts of nature wandering your near surroundings.<br/><br/><strong>Noise</strong><br/>Although not a physical threat, sounds may be your worst enemy. Caused by great anxiety and fear, be prepared to fight your conscience as you endure hallucinations and random bursts of involuntary actions. You cannot control how you react to noises around the neighborhood, but the way you handle them can save your life.<h3>The Environment</h3><strong>The House</strong><br/>Trapped in your owner's house without any means of escape, you must try your best to survive three days and three nights. Have as much fun during the day and make as little noise at night as possible or these days will be your last.<br/><br/><strong>The Neighborhood</strong><br/>The final night, if you manage to survive that long, you can make your escape out into the neighborhood. You are free to roam and explore. Be aware, not everywhere is safe. There are dangers unknown to you outside of the environments you are used to. The world out of the cage is a scary place.<h3>Your Choices, Your Story</h3>Make your way to one of three endings based on the way you play. Each ending requires differing choices throughout the story, whether you notice them or not.
