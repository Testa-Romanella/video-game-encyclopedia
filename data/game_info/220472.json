And hope you land in a hay wagon?  Then you're going to love this game.<br/><br/>Pilot a helicopter by tilting your device and tap to send the stunt man flying.  If he lands on the hay wagon, then you get points and you get to keep going!<br/><br/>It's simple and addictive (like you'd expect from a stunt man and a copter).<br/><br/>Thanks to Duane Blehm for the great game on classic Macintosh.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7c/b7ca968efa290a227711d7386934cfd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["R.
