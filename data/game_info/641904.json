Who is buried here? When did they live? How did they die? You have been tasked with answering these questions.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This educational game is designed to teach the player about polyomics through the discovery and analysis of an ancient Egyptian mummy. Polyomics is the umbrella term that relates to fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics. The player will collect samples throughout the mummies tomb, in the canopic jars (the jars that hold the mummy\u2019s internal organs), in the mummy\u2019s wrappings, and on the mummy themselves. These sample could then be brought to the lab and ran through machines. The output of the machines will help the player piece together the mummy\u2019s story. They will find out when the mummy lived, what their occupation was, some information about their lives, and how they died.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T04:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d1/4d12aff5aa0f4f2f775d40f7689154c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iza"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
