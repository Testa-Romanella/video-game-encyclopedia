Blocks appear on the left and right side of the screen, and you have to avoid letting them collide. The longer they stay on the screen the faster they begin to move.\u00a0 Tap on a block to get them to switch lanes.\u00a0 If they are going left, they will only go up when tapped. If they are going right, they will only go down when tapped. If they're at the top of the screen and you try and make them go up... they won't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0would've liked to have added sound effects in this game, but I\u00a0didn't have enough time as this game took me 2 hours and 59 minutes and 15 seconds. I'm not going for 1st place. I'm going for \"Under 3 hours\"\u00a0\ud83d\ude00 That being said, I would like to have made cute characters that evolve/change based on speed, just to let the players know how many times they've gone back and forth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Known bugs/issues:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ol><li>\"Most Active\" is suppose to be a high score, not current amount on screen</li><li>\"Most Active\" changes before block appears on screen, while ! is showing</li><li>No audio</li><li>No way to identify at quick glance if tapping will go up or down.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T04:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a92b0f4b501367b3d0a6e39769803d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrTroy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
