Secondly plant seeds and water them. You can refill the watering can at the well. Wait for the crops to grow and then harvest them and throw them in the chest. Good luck!</p>\n\n\n<p>(Although the game is designed to do so, it can be played alone. But keep in mind it'll be quite difficult!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Player1 : *</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Q-D = Left to right movement</li><li>Z = Jump</li><li>S = grab/use tool</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2:</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right arrow = Left to right movement</li><li>Up arrow = Jump</li><li>Down arrow = grab/use tool</li></ul>\n\n<p>* Player 1 uses the keys ZQSD, this is the same as WASD but for AZERTY keyboards which we use Belgium. To make the game easy to play I recommend switching to an AZERTY keyboard in your computer settings. Follow these steps to switch keyboards on windows.</p>\n\n<p>The game has been made in 3 days:</p>\n<ul><li>Day 1: prototype/basic mechanics</li><li>Day 2: improving art + polishing</li><li>Day 3: sound effects + adding some other mechanics</li></ul>\n<p>I made all the assets (artwork, coding, sound effects) myself, apart from the music.<br/>Music credits:\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/music/game-music-repetitive-quiz-style-music-bed-light-...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a313a2e7be7d927e0974763aed53ed3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AvalonDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
