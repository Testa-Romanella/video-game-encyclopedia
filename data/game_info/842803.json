In the thought experiment, a hypothetical\u00a0cat\u00a0may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead as a result of its fate being linked to a random\u00a0subatomic\u00a0event that may or may not occur.<br/><br/><br/>Concept of the game : Dr. doing the Experiment with the cat in the cardboard box. but cat make itself free from the box and run away from the window of the room.<br/>and then dr tries to catch it.<br/>later cat realize that a big hammer hung on the crane which can be fall on the poisionous gas after the explode of radio active.<br/>and yup this is what the\u00a0<strong>Schr\u00f6dinger's cat</strong>\u00a0arrangement in the box.<br/>so its mean the cat is still in big box . as it come the big box that it our world then further we see that a box is kept on the table and it is vibrating. its mean the Universe is spliting with the no. of choices\u00a0 of the cat .ie dead, alive....... </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38ef296200bb1081eef5db74984f69fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prathakpr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
