Keep playing, don't give up.</p>\n<p>Shoot against your deepest fears and disillusions in an arcade game with a peaceful, open, and relaxing map.

Don't be afraid of the objects on the map, they can't touch you: you're a spirit.<br/></p>\n\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p>\n<p>This is an arcade game. You can move freely on the map and shoot with unlimited bullets. With each round, a new enemy will spawn and you will have to defeat him to continue. The further you go, the stronger your enemies become. If the enemy is close enough you can find him by following your butterflies, which will help you in the battle. Enemies also have butterflies that will damage you if you touch them.
