The objective of our hack was to make a fun, simple platformer. We ended up making one, and although there are some mechanics such as power-ups that we could have added, we added different mechanics, such as a boss fight. We also added art that we didn't think we'd have time for. We hope you enjoy our first game on itch.io!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c0/8c0437e6b0db5f237580fdd4cdd3d821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["venkatrao1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
