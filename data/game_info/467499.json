The theme was out of control.<br/><br/>This game is based on a true story.\u00a0Before the first manned flight to space we sendt apes. They were competent highly trained astronauts much braver than humans that's why we gave them this mission.\u00a0<br/>During this particular flight the autopilot failed soon after launch and our brave ape hero Mortimer has to fly the rocket himself to the moon. You probably never heard this story from NASA or Roscosmos\u00a0because it is a little embarrassing that the apes beat both the soviets and Neil Armstrong to the moon.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Controls and game play:<br/>The objective is to fly a rocket controlling each of the 3 engines individually.</p><p>left truster: Q speed up, A speed down.\u00a0<br/>center truster: W\u00a0speed up, S speed down.<br/>right truster: E speed up D speed down.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Occasionally a truster will malfunction or the wind will take your ship and you have to compensate for this.<br/>\u00a0Make sure you dont stray to far left and right, dont go to slow or burn up the engines.</p>\n<p>Music by good ol' Kevin McLeod\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Inspired by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3918-inspired<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f2bc0e879c2fd5642231b46a5949ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatadorMix"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
