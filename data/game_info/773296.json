If a player misses a block in an attempt to jump, they\u2019ll fall back to the ground and have to jump back to the platform again. You\u2019ll also have to avoid enemies you come across. If you touch an enemy, the game is over. The objective is to reach the goal door.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>to move left:</em>\u00a0left arrow key or A key</p>\n<p><em>to move right:</em>\u00a0right arrow key or D key</p>\n<p><em>to jump:</em>\u00a0spacebar\r\n</p>\n<p><em>to climb up:</em>\u00a0up arrow key or W key</p>\n<p><em>to climb down:</em>\u00a0down arrow key or S key</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13c/13c9e6cd1f6ed5b7818baf6acf502da3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JoodanRe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
