If you want to download it for some extra crazy blood-spilling action - I'm gonna unfortunately break your hopes. For now, it's only the prologue and 1st chapter, which means nothing of that kind happens\u00a0<em>yet</em>. In fact, like 90% of this is dialogue (mostly Italy's monologue), but I PROMISE, most of it is gonna be important for the later chapters in order to understand some things.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Please support the original creator of the story by giving her kudos or stars on\u00a0<strong>AO3</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>Wattpad</strong>!!\r\n</p>\n<p>Her work is amazing and I definitely recommend it!\r\n</p>\n<p>~~QUICK CREDITS~~\r\n</p>\n<p>(More can be found in game folder)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0SilvermistAnimeLover\r\n</p>\n<p>MMD MODELS:\r\n</p>\n<p>Nachi Akira (Italy, Romano)\r\n</p>\n<p>kanaha (England, Japan, Germany, Prussia, France)\r\n</p>\n<p>zeze (America, Canada)\r\n</p>\n<p>Froco (China)\r\n</p>\n<p>FamibunP (Spain)\r\n</p>\n<p>roco (Russia)\r\n</p>\n<p>notQ (chair)\r\n</p>\n<p>MMD POSE:\r\n</p>\n<p>snorlaxin\u00a0(Sitting)\r\n</p>\n<p>CHARACTERS:\r\n</p>\n<p>Hidekaz Himaruya (All HETALIA Cast)\r\n</p>\n<p>SilvermistAnimeLover (Yang)\r\n</p>\n<p>CG (Title Screen and screenshots) were made using MikuMikuDance 9.32\r\n</p>\n<p>All of pictures in game were created by Yunko</p>\n<p>CODING &amp; MAPPING - Yunko</p>\n<p>BETA-TESTERS:<br/>Childself<br/>TEM<br/>Leyari<br/>Casen<br/>cheariiz<br/>-sns-sus-<br/>yuro._.cosp\r\n</p>\n<p>~~~\r\n</p>\n<p>SOME INFO\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>This won't work on Mac and Chromebooks.\r\n</li><li>RTP is already in the folder!
