I might develop this game more with better controls, graphics and stuff.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3c/e3c139d8cb998878a567800f724c2219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kushagra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
