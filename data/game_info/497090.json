I followed the \"<strong>Wonder Woman 84</strong>\" tutorial instructions and this is a mini-game based in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As I said before\u00a0 \u00a0I followed the tutorial and took my respective notes and after all of\u00a0 \u00a0 it I started to make\u00a0 \u00a0a simple\u00a0 prototype. It was done by me under a 15 minutes time frame (including all the assets done by me too)- which is super fast ! I think this a very nice exercise that can be done in a classroom for a group of kids around 9-12 years old without any problem.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed a lot the easy to use and friendly interface of Arcade.MakeCode and\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I'm going to explore the features of the game engine and see If I can do bigger maps and complex mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So far is a really cool tool for game maker enthusiasts and an absolutely amazing educational resource for people of all ages!</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to the people who did that amazing tutorial and to the community and dev team of Arcade.MakeCode!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE #1:</strong> I used the \"Publishing Games\" docs of Arcade.MakeCode to learn how to publish a game into ITCH.IO<br/></p>\n<p>I did the following:</p>\r\nHTML Embed\r\n<p>Embedding the game in itch.io is a little more complex, but will allow folks to play your game on the itch.io page directly! In the MakeCode Arcade editor, click \u2018Share\u2019 in the top left, then \u2018Publish Project\u2019. At the bottom of the \u2018Share Project\u2019 dialog you will see a blue \u2018&gt; Embed\u2019 link. Click on that link and select the \u2018Simulator\u2019 tab. Copy the generated embed code into a text file, and save it as\u00a0[your game].html</p>\n<p>In the itch.io \u2018Create a new project\u2019 page, select \u2018HTML\u2019 as the kind of project. Click the \u2018Upload files\u2019 button to upload your HTML file, and check \u2018This file will be played in the browser\u2019. Under \u2018Embed Options\u2019, we recommend:</p>\n<ul><li>Width\u00a0500\u00a0px x Height\u00a0580\u00a0px</li><li>Select the \u2018Mobile friendly\u2019, \u2018Automatically start\u2019, and \u2018Fullscreen button\u2019 checkboxes.</li></ul>\n<p>Fill in any additional details about your game, and hit publish!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE #2:</strong>\u00a0As you can see\u00a0 above there are many specific steps, however there are important things that need to take into account and aren't included there. The HTML needs to be renamed to \"index.html\" or \"index.zip\" (if zipped) to be able to run into the ITCH.IO platform. And the Width 500px Height 500px cuts a part of the layout so I used 500x600 instead. That's it. All the process is very simple.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da628474a80af68d61b9918efb69c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrKarate"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
