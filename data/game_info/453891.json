{"id": 453891, "slug": "barbe-aux-trousses", "name": "Barbe Aux Trousses", "name_original": "Barbe Aux Trousses", "description": "<p>We got inspired from old sea charts where geographical informations meets fantastics creatures. From there, our idea was to transcribe the fighting spirit of the pirates but in a casual way. So, in line with games like Bomberman or Towerfall Ascension, Barbe aux Trousses creates a user-friendly gaming experience, but where all is fair. <br/></p>\n<p>Barbe aux Trousses is a 1v1 arena fighting game where a sea chart is literally the playfield . To earn victory, each one must destroy the other until the time runs out or by be the most rich at the end of the round.</p>\n<p>Each player can canon shoot with power control. The player got also the ability to drop bombs like invisible traps. Keep in mind that the owner can trigger his own bombs.</p>\n<p>Treasure chests appears, gathering them give to the player gold ingots which can be used to purchase bonuses (who spawns randomly on the playfield) like health, bombs... When the time runs out the player who holds the most gold ingots wins the round. Octopus also spawns in the arena. They are passive but damages players on hit. In a round, on the last 30 seconds, octupus spawn rate increases, which intensifies end round phase.</p>\n<p>The game can be played with 2 players on the same keyboard. But we suggest using GamePad (Xbox 360 controllers) for a better experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T07:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e17a4a19d437ef8d890824efcd2d346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pamplemousse"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
