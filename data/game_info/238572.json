Our goal is to help Mai-Chan serve her sweet buns to\u00a0customers at her bakery.</p>\n\n<p>The 4 cards at the bottom of the screen represent the orders of Mai-Chan's customers. Each customer wants a specifc number of a single type of pastry.\u00a0Our task is to find and select a line of pastries on the board that matches one of the cards.\u00a0We can select vertical or horizontal lines. But it needs to be an uniterrupted line of the same pastry</p>\n\n<p>We can only serve lines of\u00a0pastries that perfectly match one of the cards. Some orders are easy to satisfy - like the x1 oders. Others may require some setup - like the x3 orders.<br/></p>\n<p>If we ever get stuck, we can look into the magical Star Box to activate special powers. Special powers cost stars. We can gain more stars by aligning 4 of the same pastry in a row.</p>\n\n<p>We lose the game if we get stuck and run out of stars. But if we manage to serve all of the order cards in the deck, we win!</p>\n\r\n\r\nMaking Of\r\n<p>This game was created as part of the A Game By Its Cover Jam 2018.
