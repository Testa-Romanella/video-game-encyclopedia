The time of day influences the world around you significantly. This makes for some quick reaction time platforming with a high skill ceiling. Aswell as some puzzles to solve along the way.</p>\n<p>Your ultimate goal is to find out your purpose in an abandoned temple, but the way there is rough. Having to climb mountains and tunnel trough dangerous mines.</p>\n\r\nBest played with a controller!\r\n\n\r\nThis is the demo version of the game, which is unfinished.
