He rarely leaves the watchful care of his no nonsense governess. He spends his days at his parent\u2019s expansive estate, working to expand his education.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never even had a real friend before.   </p>\n<p>That\u2019s the only life Arno has ever known.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But something strange is going on with Arno\u2019s father. He's rarely ever around, comes home late and spends all of his time in his basement workroom. One night, Arno thinks he hears whispers and crying coming from behind the basement door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Arno is kept safe and secure far from the outside world, the ancestral halls of the Mephisto estate hold many dark secrets.\u00a0And not even Arno\u2019s innocence can protect him from what truly happens behind closed doors\u2026</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt is easy to stay on the path, always doing what you\u2019re told.
