You play as an archer that shoots special arrows. You start with infinite regular arrows, and as you explore you will find one of each type of special arrow. Each arrow teleports back to your quiver 7 seconds after you shoot it. There are multiple areas and cities to explore, all in one continuous world without any loading screens.</p><p>Note: The game is an early-release demo and not fully representative of the final product. Any money donated to the project will go to commissioning the animator I have in mind to make animations for the game. When no more money is required to pay the animator for his remaining\u00a0 work, then I will stop accepting donations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fecabc1978e95fc2f64184f3c3e40c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dawnbreaker Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
