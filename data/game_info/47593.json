You cannot harm or knockout the guards, so you will need to find a way to slip past them unnoticed, also you can distract the guards by making noise or by footsteps, doing so they will investigate the source of the noise you made, changing temporarily their usual patrol route, you may take advantage of this and slip past them and get access to guarded areas that otherwise are not accessible without being detected. Remember that if the guards will spot you they will start shooting at you and other guards will arrive very soon as reinforcements, you may try to escape them but this won't be that easy, so be careful and try to stay undetected.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour mission is to retrieve as much loot as you can, that is: purses with gold, chests and special items worth gold and usually well guarded.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you complete a level, you will get some end level points evaluating your performance during the level, and the next level will be unlocked on the map. Also if you wish to improve your level score you may play again a level as many times as you wish, but remember that unlocking the top perfect achievement for each level won't be so easy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat people say about the game:<br/>\r\n\"it looks like old school arcade game, with modern graphics. There is a lot of emphasis on sneaking mechanism, and a lot of things around it, making noise, distraction, and others. This is definitely a plus, because it\u2019s adding a \u201cthink quickly\u201d element, to arcade mechanism of collecting loot. Gameplay looks very engaging\".<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game includes a tutorial level explaining how the game works; a Readme file explaining how the game works, the control buttons and so on, is also provided.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee726af84789830adecf4478832fb91c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["indie970"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Ghxstudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
