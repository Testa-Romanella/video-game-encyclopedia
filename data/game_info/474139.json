Imagine your player is on the space in \r\nthe middle of the card; you can move to the squares in blue (as long as\r\nthey're on the board and do not contain one of your players).  \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you land on your enemy his or her piece is removed from play. (Yes!)\r\nIn the unlikely event you have no valid moves for any of your players, please click 'pass' (otherwise you must play).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAfter you play, you will exchange the card you've played with the \"swap card\" (which means your sworn enemy will get to use that card later).  Think carefully!  \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTwo ways to win:  (i) capture your enemy's leader (the one wearing a crown); or (ii) move your leader onto your enemy's base.\r\n</p>\n<p>Good luck!\u00a0\ud83c\udf40<br/></p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p><strong>Food Fight</strong>\u00a0is built using\u00a0the L\u00d6VE2d framework.<br/>It is inspired by\u00a0the game Onitama.<br/>\r\nAll emojis designed by\u00a0OpenMoji\u00a0\u2013 the open-source\r\nemoji and icon project.
