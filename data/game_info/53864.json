You&#39;ve finally come face-to-face with the most infamous pirate of them all, Captain Hook, the fiend who&#39;s kidnapped your children and sworn never to let them go. As Peter Pan, this is the fight of your life. Everything that came before - your duel with Rufio, your battles against the pirates, even your soaring flights high above Neverland - are nothing compared to this moment. Eleven levels of incredible excitement. Multiple destinations: forests, caves, caverns, towns, lagoons, icy regions, and the Nevertree. Magical items that will give you strength and special powers: apples, leaves, and pixie dust.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T05:59:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/aaf/aafed80d7166f6fd6c27c4e1271fa88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "SNES", "Game Gear", "SEGA Master System", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Core Design", "Ukiyotei", "Spidersoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
