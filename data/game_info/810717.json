See how long you can survive.</p>\n<p>So, as a form of explanation:\u00a0My real goal here was to make a game with a fleshed out and polished presentation. Which I think I managed well enough. The menus look nice, and its VERY satisfying to click on the bubbles and watch them pop. That goal didn't really include making it a 'game' or 'playable' or 'much more than a fun experiment.'<br/></p><p>Having said that, it is a FUN experiment.\u00a0</p><p>Currently the spawning of the bubbles is tied to your monitors FPS. Meaning there is no consistency of experience. Also there's not really a 'replay' option. Because I couldn't QUTIE figure out how to get a replay option to function while still being able to track how long you managed to survive. These are all problems for a later update, however. For now, I present it in all its janky ill-conceived glory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a044a6592351233b1e1a2a9cee93c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["graygriffon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
