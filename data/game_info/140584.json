You do this by building improvements to the desert, and sacrificing goods at the temple.</p>How to Play<p>The game is played in hands. There is a deck of 21 cards, and you draw hands of five from it.</p><p>You can then take as many actions as you like during the year. Actions are provided by the hexes on the board and by cards in your hand.</p><p>Clicking on a hex allows you to take the action associated with the hex. You can use each hex once during each hand. There are several different hex types with different effects:</p>Village<p>Using a village lets you play a card from your hand to create a new type of hex.</p><p>You need to be able to pay for the card from resources on the hex. Building a hex destroys the card used to build it.</p><p>When you build a hex, you get victory points equal to the height zone it was built in (one, two, or three).</p>Field<p>Using a field creates a \"grain\" resource.</p>Quarry<p>Using a quarry creates a \"stone\" resource.</p>Spring<p>Using a spring creates a \"water\" resource.</p>Trade Route<p>Using a Trade Route lets you choose any type of resource to create.</p>Aqueduct<p>Using an Aqueduct allows you to move water resources freely between the hex and all adjacent hexes <em>except</em>moving them uphill.</p>Road<p>Using a Road allows you to move grain and stone resources freely between the hex and all adjacent hexes.</p>Temple<p>Using a Temple converts pairs of water and grain resources in to victory points.</p>Using Cards<p>The primary use of your cards is to create hexes in your lands, but the cards can be used for two other things:</p><p>You can <em>discard</em> a card from your hand to select a hex and move one of the resources there into an adjacent hex.</p><p>You can <em>destroy</em> a card from your hand to choose a resource and add it to one of your villages. There are only 21 total cards in your deck, so when you destroy a card, it will not reappear in later hands.</p>End of the Game<p>The game ends after ten \"years\" (hands), and your final score is tallied. See how high a score you can get!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8b/f8ba592a3564c82a87801c2108a08fae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lone Spelunker"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
