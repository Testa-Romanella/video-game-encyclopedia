It has a procedurally generated world.</p>\n<p>Note that there are many games out there that make use of these mechanics. To me these mechanics are must haves. Still I'm giving my best to provide you guys with a unique experience. There is a rough plan on what the game will be about. I hope it will be clear over time with every next update I provide.\r\nI'm happy for everyone playing this game, while it is still on its way of being created. Join me on this adventurer by playing the game and giving me feedback.</p>\n<p>Dixelscape is considered to be in pre-alpha state. It is in active development and may therefore be unstable and feel incomplete.</p>\n<p>Play the demo version to see what's already there!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T02:57:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c22/c2200c980cee4ce6c04b6550039e81c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fuelino"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
