{"id": 833193, "slug": "stoneball", "name": "Stoneball", "name_original": "Stoneball", "description": "<p>Stoneball was inspired by the game SOKOBAN. The original rules were extended with some new ones in order to get a playable multiplayer version.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Singleplayer:</strong>\u00a0 The goal is to push the stoneballs into the holes with as few pushes as you can. The stoneballs can only be pushed at the lower levels. At higher levels, the game gives different cards, e.g. \"Pull Stoneball\", and stoneballs can be pulled too, in limited times though. The number of the available cards is written on the card.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> The goal is to push the stoneballs into the holes and get points. There are different fields available in the game with different team numbers\u00a0(from 2 to 4 teams) and pusher numbers. Each team has a color: red, gray, yellow or green. Teams move in turns. A team can move with the pushers,\u00a0with all of them, but only one of them can: use a card or push a stone. Only one stone can be pushed in one turn and in only one direction. If a player started pushing a stoneball, the rest of the team members can do nothing in that turn. Each team has limited time to do its moves. Only the active team's time passes. Moving is not mandatory, a team can pass it's turn. If all teams pass or if a team's time is up, the game will be over and the score table will be displayed. The number one is the team with the highest score. If two teams have the same points, that one with more time has better position\u00a0in the score table. The matches are public, anybody can join and watch them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T16:21:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be1a7292c79ff551d20b0ed95686986b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["andrasdev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
