The planet you inhabit is being overgrown by poisonous roots that threaten to grow deep into the earth, where they could kill the Great Spirit of the land. Use your powers and the magic of the Great Spirit's flowers to rid the planet of the danger. Play alone or with a friend in co-op to defeat the evil roots. Use the \"A\" button to smash roots, plant seeds into the earth, gather water and collect the flowers for a powerful attack. If you can fend them off long enough, you'll save the Great Spirit and your planet.</p>\n<p>Sylvia - Art &amp; Game Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Michelle - Art &amp; Game Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Susi - Code &amp; Game Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Vik - Code\r\n</p>\n<p>Markus Zierhofer - Music \r\n</p>\n<p>Nic Heese - Sounds\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T21:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce89731a6829b9b3ebd7f6a58401651d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["vik", "Mitha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
