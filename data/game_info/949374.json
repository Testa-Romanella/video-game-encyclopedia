For the last year, I have been working on a game called Henward.</p>\n<p>- Introduction/Description -</p>\n<p>This is a game heavily inspired by the souls-like genre. A game in which you'll fight, roll, and attempt to maintain your stamina.\u00a0Right now I'm releasing this demo. This is demo number one. The game is nearing the end of its testing phase and I'm so glad to finally be able to share this mini-project with you. As of right now, there is currently one boss and two separate enemy types for you to check out. I have many more things to come in the near future. Right now I just hope you enjoy this little taste of the content. There are currently two weapons, the cracked great sword, and the iron swinger. There will also be some sorcery planned for a future demo release. Right now the sorceries are being worked on, and some different types of weapons and items as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The Gameplay -</p>\n<p>The way I want the combat to work is based on some rng. The boss's attack patterns are entirely random as well as the weapon and items you will receive. The weapons and items are received through totems. The combat all together is random in a sense and I really like the way it works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The Controls -</p>\n<p>You can move Henward left or right with \"A\" and \"D\" on the keyboard. You can make Henward jump with the \"Space\" key and you can roll with shift (be sure to turn off sticky keys). You can attack when a weapon is equipped while right-clicking with your mouse. When you pick up an item you can select it while left-clicking with your mouse.</p>\n<p>- Bugs/Issues -</p>\n<p>I'm aware of a couple of bugs and issues that have to do with collisions. I'm currently looking for a fix but right now my biggest priority is going to be content. If you have any issues or find any bugs, let me know in the comments and I will try my best to find a solution.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0A big thanks -</p>\n<p>I want to give a big thanks to the game maker community for all their help. None of this wouldn't have been possible without them. The game was put together through numerous tutorials and lots of help from the game maker community.</p>\n<p>- Updates -</p>\n<p>Demo 1.1 - Changed some things and fixed a couple of little bugs. The changelog</p><p>is in the zip.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c95a93cf3fbc68f47cee5dba13498f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ImAlexander"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
