I am still experimenting with the AI so I might use it in a future game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Short How to play - Find the cans, start the\u00a0 generator and yeet away from the hag</strong></p><p><strong>Long How to play\u00a0</strong>- There are 15 jerry cans spread across the map alongside a generator that you're supposed to start.\u00a0<strong>The generator\u00a0</strong>is located\u00a0<strong>at the center of the maze.\u00a0</strong>You need to collect the cans and start the generator afterwards in order for the doors to open.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>A lady also haunts the same maze and you might have some friendly interactions with her however, the lady is very eager to keep you with her so the higher the number of cans you found, the more aggresive she is. Do watchout for her bites, as your puny body may or may not survive them. Oh and... <strong>She doesn't really like them bright lights</strong>, so you might find some safe spots in the map.</p>\n<p>Lastly, as soon as you'll start the generator, the lady will get mad and try to stop you from escaping. Think you can <strong>run</strong> it off? Well.. not really because navigation can get difficult when you are looking at yourself through her eyes. (Second Person Mechanics, ta-da!)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> - Use <strong>WASD</strong> for movement, <strong>mouse</strong> to look around, <strong>E</strong> to pick the cans and <strong>shift</strong> to sprint.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Note - The windows build might be more stable than the WebGL build.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Used -</strong></p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/Idalize/sounds/408211/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/Grez1/sounds/485802/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/13NHarri/sounds/511043/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/Zetauri/sounds/326984/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://freesound.org/people/xUMR/sounds/488827/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-free-10-sky-skybox-set-146014\r\n</p>\n<p>The models were made by me in blender and textured using textures.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters -</strong></p>\n<p>The characters are based on my friends.</p>\n<p>Protagonist - Nicholas Perea\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lady\u00a0- A flatmate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T09:11:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a30f1c90c38a24d2597d0f60881c848.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Frosty :3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
