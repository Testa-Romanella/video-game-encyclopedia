It's influenced by the classic shoot em up games commonly found on 8 bit home computers of the early 1980's. The game that has most inspired this one is the ZX Spectrum classic Arcadia.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is straight forward enough. You have to survive each level for 60 seconds whilst shooting as many enemies as you can to increase your score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:50:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a86/a86de39c8aba72a045093c23de670c40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["YorkshireKev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
