You, an ordinary person, decide to see for yourself. Do you dare take the plunge?<br/></p>\n<p>The Catacombs is a turn-based RPG and my first full release. It's merely meant to be a practice game so that I could learn how to use GameMaker 2. It's very short, but I'm proud of it for my first product. Please let me know of any bugs and I'll make sure to check them out.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move<br/>Space - Interact<br/>X - Pause<br/>F1 - Toggle Fullscreen<br/>ESC - Exit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df2651491313ac67ad59b3727991e7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrCrowley13"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
