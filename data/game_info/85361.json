This completely new original game is a fusion of old style arcade and new recent games but keeping that retro vibe. Includes realistic simulated L.E.D. display. Incredibly easy to learn but incredibly challenging to play.<br/><br/>(a bug has been spotted  related to Apples iAds -just restart app and should all be fine until we update - please be patient)<br/><br/>Note: As this is a free version, it contains ads. Paid version will be available soon.<br/><br/>Simple game play:<br/>Avoid the \"towers\" and navigate the \"catacombs\" <br/>Blast away obstacles to fly through.<br/>Avoid the enemy missiles firing at you from below. <br/>One hit and adios!<br/>Gain points and missiles for every obstacle you manage to avoid. <br/>Hold down for thrust and let go to fire missile.<br/>Simple right? <br/>Supports Game Center to challenge your friends.<br/><br/>Warning: Contains challenging if sometimes frustrating moments similar to \"Flappy Bird\". If you like Flappy Bird then here is a unique twist on it. If you suffer from a nervous disposition or rage then check out our fart stylophone instead  \"parpophone\".<br/><br/><br/>If this interests you, check out our emulated tabletop retro arcade games emulations.<br/><br/><br/>Thank you for looking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c59b344a57f02caab6d1a1def0e77c4.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWlcY6O41p4", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Rob Wilmot"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Rob Wilmot"], "esrb_rating": null}
