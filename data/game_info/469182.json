Many assets in this game are placeholder assets until I draw things like new/custom face sprites/graphics. This is also the first game I've ever made, so if things are kiiiinda unpolished, that's why. Don't worry, I'll polish everything once the game itself is in Beta, or until I feel it has enough content to warrant polishing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/5324de3a77b86b982ed2dfbf4043ce68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PastelMask"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
