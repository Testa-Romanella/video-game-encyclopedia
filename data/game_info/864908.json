{"id": 864908, "slug": "cyber-knight-1990", "name": "Cyber Knight (1990)", "name_original": "Cyber Knight (1990)", "description": "<p>Cyber Knight (\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8, Saib\u0101 Naito) is a science fiction PC Engine and Super Famicom role-playing video game that combines sci-fi space exploration with strategic robot combat. This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow. Two years later, a sequel was released for this game titled Cyber Knight II: Chiky\u016b Teikoku no Yab\u014d. The games were only released commercially in Japan, however there are a fan-translations from Japanese to English by Aeon Genesis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T01:09:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c01/c012b9715c3205afb47cfabdf1ce7679.jpg", "website": "https://aeongenesis.net/projects/ck1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "SNES"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Tonkin House"], "esrb_rating": null}
