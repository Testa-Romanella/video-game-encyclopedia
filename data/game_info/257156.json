Use space bar to jump and Y to yell at kids. You pick up items by walking over them. Make sure to yell at the kids every now and then so the timer doesn't run out. There are 7 items to collect. If you jump in the pool before there is a drowning child, you will slow down.\u00a0</p><p>My game is about when I was a lifeguard in high school. Most of my days were spent picking up things by the pool that people had left and yelling at kids who were misbehaving, so I didn\u2019t ever really need to jump in the pool most days. This game is inspired by a specific instance one day while I was working when a kid pretended to drown while I was working and I dove in to save him. I didn\u2019t include the pretending part in my game, but I think it makes sense all the same. \u00a0I thought that this experience would make a fun game which is why I chose it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I really liked coding this game! It was fun to come up with ways to make this game slowly come to life. As I was iterating through the game, I would suddenly get new ideas on how to do something and it was really fun to make my game work as best as I could. I did not enjoy 3D modeling, however. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly good at it, so it was frustrating when I couldn\u2019t create the shapes that I wanted to make. Plus, I had a lot of difficulty when trying to paint my meshes. I also didn\u2019t like putting the game in itch.io. For some reason my game layout is always different when I export to WebGL and it was frustrating to continually make tiny layout changes. Overall, I\u2019m happy with how it looks, but the main source of my stress in creating this game was 3D modeling.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Michelle Chow for providing the \"Help!\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b659a52d762be872beb49a10defa2a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["msutton22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
