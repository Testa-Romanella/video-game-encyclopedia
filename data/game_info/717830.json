The game have just 6 stages. This astonishing number is due to my experience. </p>\n<p>Do you remember that 100 levels in one, with the Blue Elephant? I tried to do something like, with a twist, but let's just say that I took a bite more then I can chew. I found out that implementing new mechanics that I wanted but had no idea how to code, in this short time, is very challenging, and also rewarding when your idea works from the beginning. I'm not going to lie, I really had fun for my first jam, and I will look forward for the next one (I think I'll join one of the weekly one)<br/><br/>Credits: <br/>Background Music - FallenLeaves by Hinaa on chosic.com</p>\n<p>Assets - 2D Mega Pack by Brackeys on unity assetstore</p>\n\n\n<p>Thank you again, feedback is really appreciated! Maybe points and ideas where I can do better. Keep on Jammin'!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T05:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/14562fdb5207c3f23c2759f73b9eda2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gamomatic Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
