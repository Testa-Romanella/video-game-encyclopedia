I decided to go for a little platformer on a constantly evolving level.</p><p>The goal is to collect the littles balls that are floating in the level. Each time you do, a block will appear instead of the ball.</p><p>It can be a White or Black block, a blue block or a red block.</p><p>Red blocks kill you!<br/>Blue blocks are always here.<br/>White and black blocks can switch color by pressing the Switch button ( Tab, Alt, Shift, Control, Q, W, E, or even (X) on a Xbox360 controller ). You can walk on black blocks, but you go right through the white ones.</p><p>If you touch a red block or the time runs out, the game ends.</p><p>You can watch a preview of the game here :</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3bec83968ee076a94685aa1701159406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["monsieurvinou"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
