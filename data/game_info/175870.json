The game has a few bugs that I'm working on fixing but I need to release the game before St. Patrick's day is over. So here it is:</p><p>Leprechaun VS Bears. A game where no leprechaun is safe from the evil bears. In order to live you must kill all of the bears before they kill you.</p><p>Controls:<br/>Arrow keys to move. Spacebar to shoot and left shift to run.</p><p>If there is anything you would like to see in the game please comment. You can also comment on my Ur-Net Page http://urnet.net78.net/RoggieGaming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee3a01784e992569b3552cc5daccd079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Roggie Gaming"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
