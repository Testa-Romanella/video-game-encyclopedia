This new game aims to have the same general graphics and atmosphere as the old one, while also adding and changing some elements to make the game more fun.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- A working menu (In progress)</p>\n<p>- An entire randomly generated LCZ</p>\n<p>- Most rooms found in LCZ</p>\n<p>- Full intro</p>\n<p>- A captions system</p>\n<p>- A HCZ, but not complete (Just a dev test. Game explains how you can play it)</p>\n<p>- A pocket dimension for SCP-106</p>\n<p>- The SCP-049 security room event (Only SCP-106 is there because SCP-049 has not been added yet)</p>\n<p>- Cool sounding audio replacements to add more atmosphere and ambience.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP's</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- SCP-173 (Opens doors, Kills player, travels)</p>\n<p>- SCP-939 (In the storage basement, can hear, can kill the player)</p>\n<p>- SCP-106 (Emerges from the ground and chases you. Can pass through solid doors.)</p>\n<p>- SCP-012 (Behaves pretty much like the original game)</p>\n\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Decals are pretty wack<br/></p>\n<p>- SCP-173 can sometimes kill the player through doors</p>\n<p>- Screens textures are broken</p>\n<p>- Screen overlay is broken</p>\n<p>- Ambience will not trigger by default upon leaving the start area when first starting the game. Must load into another ambience trigger, then leave that one to get it working (Or just save and load, then it will work)</p>\n<p>- Sound effects sometimes stop playing entirely when SCP-106 emerges. Restart the game to fix.</p>\n<p><strong>Please LEAVE A COMMENT on any more bugs you may find.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggestions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you have any ideas on things to add/change/remove to make the game better, please comment below, as it helps give feedback on how to project is going.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T17:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/863bae8366502f3da8ac6aa97b28aa6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatJamGuy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
