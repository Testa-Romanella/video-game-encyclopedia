I did not have time to worry about different resolutions. Sorry.</p>\n<p>The game is based on a stupid idea and is not really serious (hence the title). I thought of Pluto, the dwarf planet, when I read the jam theme and then thought of the classifications of mini planets. (Pluto is not considered a planet because there are objects in its orbit.) There are actually people who campaign for Pluto being re-elevated to planet status again, so the joke of someone trying to \"help\" the planet is not entirely far-fetched.</p>\n<p>I didn't have time to include all the ideas I had but I wanted to turn it in for the jam. It works, but I'll definitely revisit it as soon as I can.</p>\n<p>All images are from NASA's official website, which is a fascinating place that hopefully gets some advertising this way. \u00a0(www.nasa.gov) Space looks really cool.<br/></p>\n<p>Navigation is a bit difficult, but hey, it's in space. :-)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:08:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7e/d7e3dafb3cbb902d8ed0539c7d10d946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
