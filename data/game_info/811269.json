Your task is to get a high score using randomly given cards, representing buildings. Building these rewards score for being in proximity to other buildings or objects, but can also give negative score (for example: factory being too close to a residential building).</p>\n<p>It is a pretty simple game without much content. I may or may not keep working on it. Even if I may never update the game, I would still value any constructive criticism or ideas to improve the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Camera movement<ul><li>WASD or arrow keys to move</li><li>Hold right mouse button to rotate</li><li>Mouse wheel to zoom in/out</li></ul></li><li>Building - Left click drag and drop, Right click to cancel</li><li>Rotate building - R</li><li>Flip card for more info - F</li><li>Main Menu - Esc</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T10:13:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae0056a6419ce6d7fe2e4be40f7a839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["br3zz1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
