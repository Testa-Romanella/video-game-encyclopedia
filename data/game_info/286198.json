Fenses can be oppened with enough money, as well as wells can give you guns and refill that guns ammo for the same price. Zombies drop ammo boxes which give you an additional 20 bullets in your total ammo. They also will drop gun parts which can be used at the fountain to recieve a random gun like the shotgun, sniper, rocket launcher, and submachine gun. The safe in the back of the map (costs 100) can be used to upgrade your guns power. Have fun and survive as long as you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-21T03:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0c8ac3766b8a8f149d5b92a46878db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SmokeySpace"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
