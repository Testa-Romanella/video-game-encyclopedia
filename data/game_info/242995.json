This means I\u00a0will be adding a story mode, fix some bugs\u00a0and hopefully finish this by the end of the year. Until that happens, please try it out, tell me how it is and most importantly- have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Select and shoot\u00a0with your magnetic button or by tapping your screen, depending on your gear. Avoid incoming asteroids by moving your headset, shooting works in the same fashion, aim your ship towards the direction you want to shoot, rather than tapping on what you want to fire. Though I will add some homing shots as alternate fire modes, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues I'll iron out in the near future:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0No explosion animation for asteroids yet</p>\n<p>- Limiting shot speed</p>\n<p><strong>Coming soon:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Bosses</p>\n<p>- Story events</p>\n<p>- Power-ups for different abilities</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n<p>Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) or above</p>\n<p>Gyroscope in your phone</p>\n<p>VR head mount\u00a0(e.g. Google Cardboard)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/722487318987595728b61eef82cf37cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["owlee"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
