This strange book absorbs her in a portal to the past, specifically to Paris in 1789, in the middle of the French Revolution, but on the way the book loses two pages. These are scattered by a series of emblematic locations of the Parisian city, such as the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The aim of Olaya is to recover the pages in order to return to her time.</p>\n\n\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows 7, 8, 10</li><li>Processor:\u00a02.3 GHz Dual Core</li><li>Memory:\u00a01 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics:\u00a0Intel HD 4000</li><li>Storage: 300MB available space</li></ul>\r\nContols\r\n<ul><li>The LEFT arrow to move to the left</li><li>The RIGHT arrow to move to the right</li><li>SPACE to jump</li><li>CTRL to hide behind the marked objects (the mirror and the vase)</li><li>ESC to pause the game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34e/34ee9f5748b28592a8230a946026cbe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MariaCases"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
