Her mission? To hunt and disenchant possessed objects that went out of control as well as obtaining their corrupted essence. During her stay, she\u2019ll meet some of the inhabitants of the city and, with them, friendship, trust, partnership, and even love might come. But be aware, for the city\u2019s past remains in the shadows. Looks like a place full of secrets\u2026 after all, maybe it\u2019s true that not all that glitters is gold.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ryder is Doresys\u2019 guard promising young soldier. He\u2019s a friendly, fearless, loyal, and charming man who is incredibly well-liked and popular among most citizens. However, he seems to enjoy being the center of all attention a bit too much. He swore to help and protect the people of Doresys, an oath he takes seriously. Could it be that despite his arrogance, Ryder has a good heart?</p>\n\n<p>Navy occupies a position of responsibility in the city since she\u2019s the mayor\u2019s main secretary. A bit selfish and independent, Navy takes her job very seriously, and sometimes, that means she has to stay close to the new enchantress. But maybe she\u2019s a little bit too interested in our protagonist. Could she be hiding something?</p>\n\n<p>Gabriel is a young researcher who left his hometown behind when he moved to the city of Doresys, hoping to be able to take a step forward towards his dreams. Being botany his main area of interest, Gabriel is a softhearted, calm and trusting man who won\u2019t hesitate to offer a helping hand whenever he can.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Steel is an honest, distrustful, and pessimistic man who prefers to be reasonable over fixing problems using his fists, even though he\u2019s tremendously good at the latter. Steel doesn\u2019t trust the new enchantress and seems to dislike her presence in the city. It appears that the most marginalized citizens respect him greatly. But why?</p>\n\n<p>Doresys is a fantasy-themed visual novel game in which your choices affect how characters behave or answer and possibly even change the outcome of some events of the story. This is an adventure lived from the perspective of a young woman as main character. You\u2019ll be able to give this protagonist any name you want as well as choose her physical appearance between two different options. Each chapter will count with, at least, one illustration from one of the key or most representative moments that you will be able to obtain with the right answers and/or your affinity with each character.</p>\n\n<p>Hi! I\u2019m Cintanna (or just Cin). I\u2019m a 24-year-old digital artist from Spain. I studied graphic design in an art school in Barcelona, but digital art and imagining my own stories is what I enjoy doing.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When I was young, I grew an interest in Otome videogames and, for a long time, I\u2019ve been thinking about starting my own project.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I decided to start working on Doresys as a personal project, something enjoyable to work on that would also let me explore and improve my drawing, writing, and coding skills while I create my own stories with my own characters. I hope this will be a fun and fulfilling experience, but above all, I hope you enjoy it!\r\n</p>\n<p>You can support me and gain access to extra content about Doresys on my <strong>Patreon</strong>: patreon link here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:49:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5606c4e15a372ebf8ebe8521bceed9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cintanna"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
