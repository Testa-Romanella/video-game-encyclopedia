While Galactic Lander provides the classic ship controlling gameplay, it also includes modern Steam features such as co-op gameplay, a level editor, Steam workshop, and more!</p>\n<p>The Game Levels<br />\nGalactic Lander offers several levels for both singleplayer and co-op gameplay. Each level contains it&#39;s own puzzle and quirk for you to solve alone; or with a friend in co-op mode!</p>\n<p>The Level Editor<br />\nThe in-game level editor allows players to create their own levels and upload them to the Steam Workshop, enabling unlimited fun by sharing levels with the Steam community, commenting and providing feedback on each others works, and playing the levels by yourself, with your friends, or with total strangers!</p>\n<p>No-Gravity Mode<br />\nIf piloting this delicate scientific ship isn&#39;t hard enough for you, and you are looking for an extra challenge, then look no further then &#39;no-gravity mode&#39;! No-gravity mode is exactly what it sounds like: no longer must you balance your ship and keep it from crashing into the floor, but now you must also not crash into the ceiling!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:08:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d48/d4800b18f171dafd96fe2f50f5f56d04.jpg", "website": "https://galacticlander.zerobyter.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZeroByter"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["ZeroByter Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
