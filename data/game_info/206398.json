The goal was to push the limits of the puzzlescript program by creating a rudimentary enemy AI capable of chasing the player while also providing a bit of theatrical flare. The player is prompted to enter a facility to obtain information about a previously failed mission. Players will put themselves into the shoes of Agent Mann and traverse the floors of the facility to find the answer to a mysterious question.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c44db9edb532687949e92c38fa8bda4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jarod Haney"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
