I got to work on 2 group projects with almost 20 people and we spent 6-7 weeks developing a proper game and multiple solo projects on Unreal engine and Unity.<br/></p>\n<p>My most recent project was a group project part of our university course in which we developed a Kart racing game in 6 weeks in remote working due to the lockdown situations. I worked as a programmer and am very proud of what me and the other 19 students achieved</p>\n<p>Here is a link to my portfolio it has more details on what i have done :<br/></p>\n<p>https://jehanzebali8.wixsite.com/mysite<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Scurvy is a third person rag doll physics game that has\u00a0 a Last man standing game mode.</p>\n<p>The goal is simple , attack your opponents by punching them or avoid them to be the last man standing.The Map has objects with random gravity and 'wacky' physics.</p>\n<p>The main goal for this game was to figure out how to work with the Unreal engine physics and how to create things such as Dynamic cameras and a player selection etc that changes the Ui automatically.</p>\n<p>This game although simple features a dynamic camera that changes its height and location according to all locations of the players. Along with that if features a main game loop that changes all aspects according to how many players are playing etc.</p>\n<p>I am currently still working on improving the game by adding new character meshes , maps and much more\u00a0</p>\n<p>All feedback is appreciated\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:27:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/557c4b8cad8cb9a8f9d5a5ac8589674d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jehanzeb"], "genres": ["Racing", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
