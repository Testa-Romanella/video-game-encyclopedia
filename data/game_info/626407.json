In this game you are locked in an seemingly infinite Ikea. to survive you need to travel to different rooms and collect food to eat. But it's not as easy as there are staff (aka Scp 2008-2). The staff are mutated and deformed versions of humans, they are mostly very tall and odd. In this game during the day they are passive, but during the night they will constantly will \"politely\" ask you to leave the store, but with there being no exit they will just chase you until you kill them or leave that room (at this point in development they do not attack you). There are also objects you can destroy to get items. You can use these items to craft an armorer, a flashlight or defense. (at this point in development there are only wooden and metal axes) (at this point in development the only way of getting metal is by killing staff).</strong></p><p><strong><em>For an more frequent\u00a0updated game, play the game source:\u00a0</em></strong><strong>Scp-3008 No Escape</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Scp-3008 No Escape is based on Scp 3008 Lone Survivor so check that out.
