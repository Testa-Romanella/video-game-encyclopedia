Why? You haven't seen your home box in several days now. Such is the life of a pet rock in a pet rock shop. Play the delicate act of balancing rocks in mid air, and of course ~~don't let them die~~, I mean keep them alive of course!</p>\n<p>Featuring: Fans, Trampolines, and Speaker bombs to aid you in your journey home, to the home box!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Actual Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>There are some quick tutorials ingame, but here you go:<br/>- Right-Click drag to move camera around, scroll to zoom in and out<br/>- Drag items from the shop and place them anywhere (you only get a certain number per round)<br/>- Press play on the bottom right and try to get the rocks in the box\u00a0<br/>- Different items do different things, and you can't move them after a round has started<br/>- There are 3 rounds per stage, each round the box moves further back, but you get more items to place</p>\n<p>Downloads for other platforms coming soon:tm:.
