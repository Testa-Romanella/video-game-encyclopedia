Get the highest score possible!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Left click to move<br/>Right click to use shield, shield will only reflect bullets when fully up<br/>If the shield meter depletes, you can't use shield untill full charge</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story behind the development</strong></p>\n<p>This was my first ever real game made using GameMaker Studio 2. Of course, naive as I am, I had a grand concept in mind. You would have been able to traverse multiple levels and kill big bad bosses. I even had a (pretty mediocre) story in mind. This was all scrapped once I realised the scope of the project, and I got a pretty cool shooter out of it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T08:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d7/6d7e4db1654b8b65f35b93847cc9c8c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jorandp"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
