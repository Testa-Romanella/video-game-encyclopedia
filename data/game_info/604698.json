Navigate your hungry little bird through the forest to collect as many seeds as possible without crashing into the ground or into the twisty vines. Survive as long as you can to see how many seeds you can collect in one run. Sounds are lower quality in web build. This game is still currently in development and I plan on adding more features to this game in the future.\u00a0This is a spin off of the classic mobile game \"Flappy Bird\" created by\u00a0Dong Nguyen.
