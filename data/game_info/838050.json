{"id": 838050, "slug": "drone-herder", "name": "Drone Herder", "name_original": "Drone Herder", "description": "<p>A game in which you defend your wheat crops from oncoming waves of slimes. You can't do much damage yourself and must therefore steer your herd of drones into the enemies to damage them. You can't control the drones directly - but they are scared of you and will try to move away from your position - so you must herd them like sheep.<br/></p>\n<p>Use coins to buy more drones, and make sure to keep them repaired when they fail.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0Move with\u00a0'WASD', speed boost\u00a0with 'SPACE'-bar and repair broken drones and use shop with 'E'. Pause with 'ESC'.</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUG:\u00a0Unfortunately there is a bug in the jam-version which prevents wave 12 and onwards from spawning -\u00a0which means no enemies will spawn after wave 11. It\u00a0will be fixed after rating period ends.</p>\n<p>Created for the Wowie Jam 4.0 using Godot and gdscript in approximately 15 hours of working time. The drones use boid flocking behaviour (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) which means every drone (boid) takes into accounts their neighbours velocities and positions when moving around. Flocking behaviour as seen with birds or fish emerges from these rules. Player is treated as a predator from which the boids flee.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first ever gamejam and published game, so all and any feedback is more than welcome, thanks:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:01:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a95/a95141dfb841532230c8255beba3e870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sebastianhb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
