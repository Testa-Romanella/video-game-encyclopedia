It was supposed to be a card counting game, where memory and strategies heavily impacted the game. This didn't pan out as people found it too intense for a mobile game. It was suggested to reduce the impact of number introduce some narrative which keeps people interested for a bit longer. <br/></p>\n<p>This gave me new direction, which morphed the game into a narrative  card game with tinder-like swipe mechanic for the controls. <br/></p>\n<p>In today's world, \"Free Press\" is become an oxymoron. This game is an attempt to see, not just black or white but shades of grey through a reporter's view<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a reporter who job is to write as many articles he possibly can, while dealing with four factions; namely Social Media Worriers, Public Mood, politicians and his company. It's on you to maintain the balance between the four and keep doing your job of a reporter.</p>\n<p>Now I'm even thinking of adding live media feed to the game, if possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a30d3a5a5f4c7cdb56c2a861b45cb94e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["delta_XION"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
