You are a cop. And this morning you're in a bad mood because you just found that your coffeemaker is not working.<br/><br/>Also, billions of hungry zombies have taken over the world.<br/><br/>You have only one hope for survival, and that is to make it to the nearby military base. It wouldn't be much of a problem if not for the legions of brain-hungry zombies in your way. So you'll just have to make a run for it. Zombies aren't particularly smart, and there are weapons scattered about, so there's a little hope for you. Also you might be able to rescue some friends along the way who can help you out.<br/><br/>Oh, and you have to do all of this with only one tap.
