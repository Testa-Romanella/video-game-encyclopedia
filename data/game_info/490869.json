Nailliv was already in the process of making the next one, so the loss didn't bother him in the slightest. He will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, killing Sargon and discovering the secrets of portal magic.<br/><br/>You come to life suddenly. The loosely constructed essence of a fallen warrior within the cold stones of a golem.<br/><br/>All you know is your current quest, and so you set out on your journey.<br/><br/>Throughout the first dungeon you find a heavy sword and fire staff with magical properties that grant you life stealing powers. As you slay scores of enemies, you accumulate gold, potions and more items to aid in your adventure. The warrior spirit eminates from your reanimated body and you continue to grow in power.<br/><br/>At last you reach him, Sargon, only to fall before his magic. As you crumble and the warrior spirit leaves you, your last thought is the hope that the next golem (or golems) will succeed where you have failed...<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/>* 1 to 4 Player Co-Op adventures<br/>   - Scaling difficulty, but if players stick together they will have a slight advantage in multiplayer games.<br/>   - Potions can be thrown at friends to help (or hurt them because it's hilarious).<br/>   - Boss fights incentivize teamwork, especially on hard mode when additional enemies are spawned with the boss.<br/><br/>* Randomized Levels, Items, Enemies, Bosses<br/>   - Every one of the game's 20 levels is randomly selected so your experience will be different every playthrough.<br/>   - Enemies are chosen from a random pool and placed on random spawn points.<br/>   - Chests and their contents, likewise, are chosen from a random pool of items and placed on random spawn points.<br/>   - Bosses are chosen from pools just like Enemies and Items.
