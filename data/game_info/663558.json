My second Godot project (the first being a Flappy Bird clone) and my submission for the STOP WAITING FOR GODOT Game Jam!</p>\n<p>Reaction Time is an endless obstacle course that\u00a0tests your ability to react to three possible hazards:</p>\n<ul><li>Jump over rocks</li><li>Shoot your trusty water gun at the enemies</li><li>Collect the yellow coins</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>D - Shoot</p>\n<p>This is the first game jam I've participated in. The art and synopsis of the game seemed \"easy,\" but obviously everything ended up taking a lot longer than anticipated. I've never made any pixel art (if we even want to call these sprites \"art\" lol)\u00a0and I think next time I'll use Adobe Illustrator for some 2D graphics instead--I'm much more comfortable there.</p>\n<p>I'm proud that I committed and finished the game, but next time I plan to do a lot of things differently. Still, this was a ton of fun and a great learning experience.</p>\n<p>Feedback appreciated :) thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/54183f75f00dae4430389fbc2c43b3a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["elejuh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
