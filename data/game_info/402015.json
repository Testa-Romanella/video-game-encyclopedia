Your friend wants to steal stuff while they can. Will you help them by distracting the shopkeeper? Or will you help the shopkeeper? Can you help them without your friend getting caught?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Closing Down</strong>\u00a0is the second chapter in my <strong>One day at a time</strong> series. The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. <strong>Closing Down</strong>\u00a0is based on the 2010 theme of \"deception\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53c2c52f768b4721485685e4640dc996.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
