If they touch a wall while red, you restart the current level.\u00a0The goal is to find a cross shaped intersection within each of the mazes where the dreamcatcher can rest comfortably.</p>\n<p>This game took roughly a month to complete. It was my first attempt at building an original game within Unity. I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with how objects could interact with one another in order to build the \"bricks\" to make levels really quickly. These included the player, the walls, spawn points, hitboxes, timers, and Unity's sprite animator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T04:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10acad0a6c76d768fb42343e4fb45498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DelaneyB"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
