I did a mini game with the OneLoneCoder Engine - Pixel Engine, an impressive tool developed in pure C++ which requires minimal dependencies so as to create games and prototypes. I really appreciate this tiny engine and C++ for games. For this reason I wanted to participate in the OLC::CodeJam 2021. This is my entry.\u00a0I know that Sokoban is not related to the theme, but I don't have many time so as to elaborate another project ++</p>\n<p>As you understand, this is another sokoban, but I have added a new feature - you have a limited number of steps so as to solve each level. For the first time in a decade, I leave my Unity station :) but just for a while...</p>\n<p>Use <strong>Arrows keys</strong> in order to move.</p>\n<p><strong>Escape</strong> to quit :/<br/></p>\n<p>PS : I share the source code of this little project here. I guess that it could be improved, but it is good enought in order to develop your own puzzle game. Have fun ++<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T11:51:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d770554d376920283362f0f83f07e0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
