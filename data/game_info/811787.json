As she exploits the programming around her, 3D objects begin to revert to simpler and simpler shapes. Will you leave to never return or stay in the world you know?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>This was made for GeoJam\u00a02022 in about 18-20 hours over the course of 3 days. If I had more time, I would've loved to add more visual elements showing the breakdown of the simulation. Maybe shown more basic shapes, add higher poly models so the downgrades were more impactful, or even add an actual ending cutscene for both endings. I'm honestly very happy with what I managed to do.</p>\n<p>*The \"box\" in the pyramid is supposed to represent some kind of supercomputer running \"real-life\" simulations. The \"boxes\" outside of it are supposed to represent general science-y office-y stuff.</p>\n<p>**The Easter Egg is a reference to the JPOP group Perfume and their song FUSION. I love that song and music video and was a huge inspiration in this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T13:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f94f6ed42b3c76a56c5531f4d856a03d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NuclearJellie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
