Try to hold back an increasing army of communists, dark crimson horses, and a \u2026 cat? Can you survive all the levels and score high in endless mode?\u00a0</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>DaBoys was my COVID pastime, and the first ever complete game I have created. I wrote the story, coded the mechanics, with some help, composed the music, and used maplestory simulator to create the sprites!\u00a0For my first game I wanted to make something special to me so I chose to make a game involving the most important thing in my life at the time, my friend group. I love all these boys as family so it was no question that I created a medium to cement our relationships until the end of time!</p>\n\r\nDetailed Credits:\r\n<p>Created By: Daniel Boghossian</p>\n<p>Music By: Sebastian Lechner and Daniel Boghossian</p>\n<p>Sprites By: Francis Malama and Daniel Boghossian</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T16:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27c/27c97a16c98050a4e1fbf39214830c86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Boghossian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
