You collect coins, mushrooms, clean up garbage and setup signs to name a few things. Feel free to give feedback as I plan on adding many new areas and quests in the future. <br/></p>\n<p>This is just a demo but is about a half hour worth of game play at this point.<br/>There are movie references mainly movies from the 80's. Hope you enjoy! Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af8c1b0a932e63920bffae1d570aaee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DSA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
