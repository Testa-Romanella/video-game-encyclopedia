Nobody can see you; nobody can hear you.</em></p>\n<p><em>But after years long practice, you can pick up a pen...</em>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>A tale of death and the monotony of life, with loss of love and faith, and the instability that can come from solitude.</em></strong>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You died in the 1930's. Sixty years on, you still roam Bartholomew. Can you find the humour in your situation, or are you in misery? Are you furious at the world, or do you get by with apathetic pessimism? Perhaps you have gone a little mad - nobody would blame you.</p><p>~~~</p>\n<p>You are alone in your world - but not in this town:</p>\n<p>The pastor, <strong>Nicole</strong>, is depressed but utterly devoted to her faith - for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Paige</strong> is a bully, plain and simple. She crashes her car and joins you in limbo, but will death change her?</p>\n<p>When <strong>Christian</strong> buys a new house, he expects a fresh start. For you, his arrival is a shock: you loved someone once, when you lived - and this newcomer is, without any doubt, their descendant.</p>\n\n<p>Nicole, Paige, and Christian will all have their own routes, which can be either antagonistic, platonic, or romantic. There will also be a loner path.\u00a0There will be no happy endings, however. At least, not in the traditional sense - and the relationships, in whichever form chosen,\u00a0will manifest entirely\u00a0through feelings and written communication.</p>\n<p>\u00a0~~~</p>\n<p><strong>Warning \u2013\u00a0<em>The Haunting of Bartholomew</em>\u00a0will contain the following subjects and themes, and this list will be updated as necessary throughout development:</strong></p>\n<p>Death\r\n</p>\n<p>Depression\r\n</p>\n<p>PTSD\r\n</p>\n<p>Mental illness\r\n</p>\n<p>Suicidal thoughts and discussions of suicide\r\n</p>\n<p>Discussions of amputation\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Looking Glass Games:\u00a0\u00a0lookingglassgames.tumblr.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T15:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53c7b5d187cf1fdbda6286107c7e40f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Looking Glass Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
