Also includes my 2013 game, \"Girl's Graveyard\", similarly frankensteined into a 2-4 player online co-op experience.</p>\n<p>Close Your Eyes you play as some little marshmallows who after escaping death row, encounter a strange game show host in an abandoned subway system, and can't seem to escape their past.\u00a0With eight different endings, should be\u00a0 90-200 minute experience.</p>\n<p>Girl's Gaveyard is a challenging arcade styled game, though is that all it is? Collect candy for a bot you fancy, and see if\u00a0you can reach the deeper depths.</p>\n<p>This is a rough experiment, I'll be bug fixing things reported to me, but expected it to be a bit buggy, and as the games weren't originally designed for co-op (though I\u00a0have made some small alterations to make it work out from a design perspective), this is more like a mod of the original games to allow people to play these games together rather than a game designed for it. Hope you enjoy, though!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T15:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7aa294b7dd0d98a6251091fcd6c67d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AestheticGamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
