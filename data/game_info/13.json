Usually rather stupid, Polarity City's favourite\u00a0maintenance cubes have suddenly\u00a0become dangerous. Far from fixing things, the Bloxbots are\u00a0destroying everything in sight... and why do they even HAVE lasers, anyway?\u00a0\n\nOnly you can\u00a0stand between them and chaos, and only you can discover who is behind this dastardly plan...\n\nMagNets is an intense arena-based collect-em-up.
