The most popular activity for them is to file complaints about the awful road infrastructure. But who can blame them? All of the roads are closed loops, and without proper guidance, they\u2019re stuck going round and round forever!<br/></p>\n<p>This is where you come in! By placing directional arrows on roads, you can get cars, bikes, pedestrians, or even busses to swap from one loop to another. Use your power wisely, to solve the many petitions submitted to the Loopton Council website.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful not to cause any crashes!<br/>(unless crashes are what\u2019s being requested, of course\u00a0\u00a0)</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong>Controls -</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>` 1 2 3 </strong>- Pause, Play, 1x speed and 2x speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Space </strong>- Pause/Play</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Shanahan</strong> - Programming / Animation / UI</p>\n<p><strong>James</strong> - Code / Audio</p>\n<p><strong>Oliver Thurston</strong> - Level Design</p>\n<p><strong>Amy Elliott</strong> - Programming / UI</p>\n<p><strong>Erin</strong> - VFX</p>\n<p><strong>Balazs Takacs</strong> - 3D Modelling</p>\n<p><strong>Louise Hunnisett</strong> - 3D Modelling</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:31:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9e6c329fd8472faae5487771f80777.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Team Horsehead"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
