Main objectives are either reaching the space elevator and escaping the planet or getting a ride on the movable city where you can get an easy life.</p>\n<p>Programming is part of vehicular combat. Programming the turret will free your hands and let you focus on other decisions and events that will occur during combat.<br/>There will be two kinds of programming languages on Sandpunk, visual programming and a generic text programming language (JS-esque). Our intention is to merge the fun of casual programming with games, without the frustration of debugging.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0f441587c0b03914860ac1924f60ef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["staberas"], "genres": ["Racing", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
