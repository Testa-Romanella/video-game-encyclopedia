The Sun Shines, Birds chirp, Monsters and Humans live together in harmony. Slimy the squidgy slime monster is eager to get home and play his brand new video game, The Legend of Grundledorf II: Bob's Asleepening. But just as Slimy is about to insert the cartridge, the entire world is plunged into darkness! A distant castle rises into the sky and looms ominously over the land. Many monsters of Ostrios see this as an omen to revert to their aggressive and evil ways, but not Slimy. Sensing a true adventure, Slimy sets off, determined to restore order to world and end the eternal night.\r\n\t\r\n</p>Links<p>\r\n\tKickstarter: \r\n\thttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1723713885/slime-of-fury\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSteam Greenlight: \r\n\thttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642692460\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFollow Jon Harwood Games on the Socials:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFacebook\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTwitter\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tInstagram\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a6068a7bf450307fa3016c66ef62064a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ninjaguy369"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
