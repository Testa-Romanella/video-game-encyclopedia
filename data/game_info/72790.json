In the garage there is an old car. If you manage to start it and open the garage door you can escape that way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can protect yourself from Granny using one of the two different types of weapons you can find in the house. But it only stops her for a while. But it's worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are five different levels of difficulty.<br/>\r\nExtreme, Hard, Normal, Easy and Practice.<br/>\r\nIf you play in Practice mode, you are in the house without Granny and have the opportunity to try different things without major difficulties. But the house is not completely free from dangers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGranny gives you five days in the house but you can earn a extra day if you do something for her.<br/>\r\nIf you have failed to escape after the last day... well, probably you can figure out what happens then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGood luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T02:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d8ad8db04b4c5fdaa908ea7b91ae7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 22, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 7, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 22, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["DVloper", "Dennis Vukanovic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DVloper", "Dennis Vukanovic"], "esrb_rating": null}
