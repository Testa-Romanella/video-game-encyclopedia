It was my\u00a0first attempt at a\u00a0VR project. It was just for fun.\u00a0But it was a good starting point.\u00a0The computer that had the final version was stolen. All that remains is this early build of it. I decided to post this old project for free to see what you guys think of it. Like I said, this one was just for fun. But, damn, do I\u00a0wish you guys could have played that final version of it. It had a completely different boss, better enemy AI, and ran a lot smoother because it\u00a0was optimized a bit more. Long story short,\u00a0it was MUCH better than this early build that we were left with. But anyway, have fun killing zombies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T13:29:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bccaaf296282925f3aae67c742c00037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoVRanty Game Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
