Set in space, you must collect the stars while avoiding the asteroids.\u00a0I mean, they're bulky, and your ship, well, isn't. So be careful!</p>\n\n<p>Music is made by the talented Eric Matyas, like it was in my previous game. Everything else, is made by me as a part of game development studies.\u00a0\u00a0The high score will be saved if someone wants to challenge you to a battle!</p>\n\n<p>The game doesn't have an \"exit to desktop\" function yet, but will be added in the future. I really would like honest feedback, since this was my first production after Galaxial Crack Shot.</p>\n<p>Thank You and happy gaming!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d6/6d6716dc3a959dafb35310bf804a3894.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Somewhat Weird Softworks"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
