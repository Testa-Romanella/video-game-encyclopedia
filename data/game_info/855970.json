Expanding the base and keeping your castle from dying is goal of the game, hence defending your dominion.</p>\n<p>There are\u00a0<strong>11 unique enemies\u00a0</strong>that can arrive on your shore.</p>\n\r\nThe ground is littered with gold instead of bodies\r\nUpgrades\r\n<p>The player's avatar can be upgraded with gold collected from fallen enemies. However, on death, the upgrades will be reset and lost.</p>\r\nConcluding\r\n<p>Dominion Defenders has been a very interesting project to explore that I didn't expect to make. It started as a dive into procedurally generated maps using Unity's tilemap system but became something much more after I added some basic interactions with the world.</p>\n<p>There are over\u00a0<strong>300 lines of dialogue\u00a0</strong>written for the enemies, and a spreadsheet of all of them can be found here</p>\n\r\nI intended to have a sheep but ran out of time :(\r\n\n<p>This project was made in\u00a0<strong>45 hours over 15 days.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out the game page! Hope you enjoy it. Dominion Defenders will not receive updates in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21e/21e6eb5c06d2d8be3da173e5e8fe56de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eapple"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
