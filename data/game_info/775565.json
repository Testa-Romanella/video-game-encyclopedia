The game will be based on the Estado Novo era and the political prisons. The game will be low polly and\u00a0aesthetically similar to those PS1 games like <em>Silent Hill</em> or <em>Resident Evil</em></p>\n<p>For now this is just a <strong>PROTOTYPE</strong>, the final game that will be released late July will have more content like story, better audio and bigger map. This is just for tests.</p>\n<p>This is a stealth game so avoid the guards and try to escape prison. Remember that you make noise while walking, so try to crouch instead to move silently. Throw small objects to distract guards, these will make a noise on the impact. The guards will investigate that noise.</p>\n<p>Please answer this form after playing the game.
