You've built a janky craft out of propane tanks and spare parts. Pilot it  from pad to pad trying to beat your best time \u2013 then flirt with that fine line between speed and control. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re brave enough to try Hard Mode you\u2019ll be flopping around like a QWOPy, low gravity turtle. With a little practice you\u2019ll be zippin' around doin' barrel rolls. You\u2019ll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics \u2013 bizarre, organic shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas. Each level is a detailed hand-crafted environment that encourages the player to explore - and goof around! You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift. <br/><br/><ul><li>25 levels to conquer and explore in pad Hopper mode<br/></li><li>25 levels in Ring Runner mode - fly through custom courses<br/></li><li>Full VR support - works on Rift, Vive, and monitors!<br/></li><li>Full (xbox 360) controller support<br/></li><li>Hidden collectibles on every level<br/></li><li>Earn stars and track your progress through all 50 levels<br/></li><li>An hour of spacey, glitch-hop music - mp3's included!<br/></li><li>Windows, OSX, and Linux!</li></ul><br/><strong>Version 3.0 is available now</strong> with better performance, improved VR support, new options menu, new tutorial, and a first person camera mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d0/2d0492124231f215002794863ce98c59.jpg", "website": "http://CrashedLander.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 44, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 323, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Don Whitaker"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Brain Blinks"], "esrb_rating": null}
