As you start off, the only thing you can do is move left and right. No jumping, shooting or climbing, you can't hear, and you can't even see. At this reduced state, you must brave all the challenges and retrieve the fragments of your stolen soul one by one, slowly regaining the ability to live again.</p>\n\n<p>Controls =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>\n<p>WASD for movement</p>\n<p>Space for jump</p>\n<p>Left click for shoot</p>\n<p>Right click for dash</p>\n<p>Stick to walls by moving into them</p>\n\n<p>Credits\u00a0=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>\n<p>Created on Unity Game Studio by Nithin Muthukumar and Daniel Liu for Ludum Dare 45.</p>\n<p>Music composed by Andrew Lin</p>\n<p>Sprite work done on piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/)</p><p>Tilemap created on Tiled Map Editor (https://www.mapeditor.org/)</p>\n<p>Sound effects created using sfxr (http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42d81341ccf3e5d9bd471a4079276274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nithinmuthukumar", "pinosaur"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
