But do you know why? I'm pretty sure it's just because they're natural hunters and want to bring you a gift, but you could consider that as a sacrifice, right?</p>\n<p>Game is quite simple, just move and jump around collecting as many sacrifices as you can. Be sure to bring them to the front door every time you catch one. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Controls: Keyboard and Joysticks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/681/6814820c4082c155a19cb6cde0ae2ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lex-m"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
