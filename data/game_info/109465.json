Blast your way through 10 missions, ranging from suburban neighborhoods to airports. With the exception of barricades used to shield yourself from enemy fire, if it's standing, destroy it before time runs out! You start with a set amount of time and earn more by destroying items. The bigger the structure, the more time it gives you. Along the way you will also encounter enemy tanks out to stop you from accomplishing your mission. Either evade them and carry on, or destroy them to add time to your clock.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhat are you waiting for? Get destroying!\r\n</p><p>\n</p>Twitter: @StudioBesus || Development Blog", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/615e5def3f331ed0a69e001b89b20496.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Besus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
