{"id": 64858, "slug": "asteroid-deflector-xl", "name": "Asteroid Deflector XL", "name_original": "Asteroid Deflector XL", "description": "Asteroid Deflector is an indie game based on simple physics. You have to prevent asteroids from hitting a planet by changing their course with various projectiles (shells, laser beams, atomics...) while working with - or against - the gravity of a planet and a star. Also watch out for economics like money, weapon research, planet population and so on.<br/><br/>It's my first game done in spare time - but with a lot of dedication. Expect some hours of fun and a good laugh at the goofy story. There is also an endless game mode to hunt for high scores. Please don't expect a refined, multimillion blockbuster game. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>- Career mode with 12 levels.<br/>- Endless mode.<br/>- 23 technologies for research, including four distinctive weapons and a mighty planetary force field.<br/>- Manage money, infrastructure, population and keep the people motivated.<br/>- Seven (YouTube friendly) spherical songs will help you get in the flow of deflecting asteroids.<br/>- Atmospheric sound effects.<br/>- Special endgame in story mode (maybe there is more to the asteroids...).<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>- Simple physics-based fun.<br/>- Don't destroy the asteroids (lame), deflect them!<br/>- Asteroids burning up in the star generate money (because... why not?).<br/>- Expensive research will improve your weapons.<br/>- Impacts on the planet will decimate the population and their moral (may result in losing the game).<br/>- After a first learning curve, the gameplay can get quite hypnotic or meditative.<br/>- Unlimited continues in career mode, saves are done after each level.<br/>- It's all about gravity, mass and kinetic energy - but in a fun way!<br/><br/><strong>FAQ</strong><br/>* Are there costly ingame purchases or will there be expensive DLC?<br/>- No ingame purchases, it's the full game. I'm working on a second campaign, it will be free for all current owners. But will raise the initial price a little for new customers.<br/>* I will wait until it is on sale.<br/>- I might put it on sale, but only right after a price increase. So the price can only go up (why would I punish early birds?).<br/>* Is this a mobile port?<br/>- No, but I may port it to mobile (and remove some features in the base version with the \"XL\" in the name, in case you were wondering).<br/>* A space cannon would never work!!!1<br/>- First of all - it's just a game. And maybe a search for \"Project HARP\" might suprise you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec96f0fb0f6cd07512b247ff0809c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andreas Cavazzini"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Andreas Cavazzini"], "esrb_rating": null}
