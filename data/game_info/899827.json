No one is allowed in this city unless they are dead or a part of the confraternity. As you slowly explore the underground, you end up getting caught by a hooded brother. You attempt to run away and find yourself stuck in a mansion. You try to find a way out but discover the exit is locked and being kept locked by a hooded brother. They explain they are not hostile because it is not their job to chase unwanted guests but to upkeep the corpses of this city. They tell you they will let you go if you clean up the mess you caused. The corpses have moved when you entered the manor\u00a0and now it's your mission to move the corpses back to their former activities. However, the hooded brothers are still on the lookout for you. Fortunately, the one in charge of the dead bodies said they will assist you in alarming when they're here with the sound of a clock.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>As you are doing what you are tasked to do, you figure out the brothers don\u2019t arrange the dead citizens of Eusapia in their desired place but in positions where they are at their darkest moments. To make matters worse you discover their souls are still intact to their dead bodies but the connection is weak. However, there are times when they can feel and sense what\u2019s happening to them and can even slightly move when their will gets strong. It does not stop there, there are clues that indicate that the corpses are to be sacrificed at specific times. What you don\u2019t know is what they are being sacrificed for and who they are being sacrificed to.\r\n</p>\n\r\nGame Design Document:\r\n<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQA3cJb-9Wwil3xPsaiJix1DfjGjqKAzmg2rnbwIxn1gLDWUNXIaieLYF_QP4qvfzslptsQjntwVr2g/pub</p>\n\r\n*Please Note*\r\n<p>If an object goes missing while interacting with them it is likely it got flung outside the walls. You will not be able to complete the game without the pickable items so it is recommended to try and die or restart the application.
