The turret can be fired by tapping input. Shield generators reflect bullets and destroy enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>UI (top right):</strong></p>\n<p>base_hp/100 | Ammo/50 | time_passed(s)</p>\n<p>The arrow below time_passed indicates left/right wind direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced:</strong></p>\n<p>When ammo is delivered to the turret your ammo will refill to 50, and your next shot will fire a nuke with 2 larger round accompanying bullets. The nuke, when it makes contact, will create a giant aoe of destruction destroying everything it touches. It will also create fallout aoe which will destroy all enemy objects. The fallout direction is determined by the wind direction (see ui) which changes sporadically. Nukes that miss and fly to the right/left offscreen have a chance for their fallout to still spill back over to the screen depending on wind. Nukes shot straight up will guarantee spill-over, but to a lesser extent. Shooting the nuke direct at enemy objects, while noting the wind direction, is 'generally' best.</p>\n<p><em>Tip: The turret moves slow, and sometimes it's best to rely on the shields while positioning the guns against future enemies.</em></p>\n<p>Made in Pico8 for the one-button-game-jam:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/the-one-button-game-jam/entries</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this you can checkout Contract Offender 2\u00a0which is similar, but gives you that nice freedom of more controls!
