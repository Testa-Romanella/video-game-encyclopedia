Run up to humans, and bite them to regain strength (you must be touching them to bite them). Your health is shown in green. You will die after 5 seconds if you do not eat brains. Your zombie friends are the same. More health = more\u00a0 S P E E D. You can also sprint, your energy is shown in blue (advised: sprint in short burts. Depleting energy to 0 will stop its regeneration momentarily). Your <strong>score</strong> is how many zombies are alive after <strong>all humans have perished</strong>. Score is measured in <strong>zoms </strong>(new SI measurement after <strong>zombles </strong>was found to be too silly).\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (xbox/ps)</strong><br/><strong>Left analog stick:</strong> Movement<br/><strong>a/cross:</strong> Bite human<strong><br/>x/square: </strong>Sprint (hold)<br/><strong>RB/R1: </strong>Debug mode, baby!
