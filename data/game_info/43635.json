Game-play resembles 1-Bit black and white old-school games, with modern touches and HD graphics.</p>\n<p>Twenty years ago, the Zenos began invading terran colonies, leaving a trail of death and tears in their wake. Terrans fought back, one planet at a time, while building a fleet to stab at the Zeno home-world.</p>\n<p>You arrive with that fleet, just after a series of massive space battles in which all supply ships have been destroyed. You are left with a huge invasion army but no supplies to invade with other than one drop-pod, and one pistol.</p>\n<p>Your standing orders are clear: END THIS WAR!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T15:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/deeec9569b82b42685f9b445001e3fa6.jpg", "website": "http://rogueinvader.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Squishy Games Co", "Squishy Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "RPG", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squishy Games Co", "Squishy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
