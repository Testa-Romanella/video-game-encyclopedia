Fights are based on real-time combat with hand-to-hand weapons. Enemies are varied and possess own abilities. The levels are mainly dungeons with intricate hallways; other than that, the game contains puzzles that can be solved through a secret code, in order to be able to unlock further maps.<br/> <br/>The game develops in four chapters, inspired by mythological and epic legendary stories.<br/><br/>Take the role of a prisoner who has lost part of his humanity as a consequence of being condemned to spend a lifetime in prison and in slavery. A strange earthquake brought down some weak walls of the prison, allowing a great opportunity to escape, but be careful with hidden traps around. Try to find a way to access the enemy\u2019s armament and get ready to fight. Decipher a secret code and discover patterns to progress along the complex dungeons.<br/><br/>No need to spend hours leveling up to become a true master of the swords, defend and attack at the right timing; forget about maps systems and also become a true maze runner. Discover what lies beyond; challenge the powerful bosses who rule that kingdom; find out the truth why you were taken as prisoner, and recall your truth self.Key Features<br/><ul><li>Tactical and real-time combat with hand-to-hand weapons.<br/></li><li>Solve puzzle through a not conventional language.<br/></li><li>Navigate through complex labyrinths without map systems.<br/></li><li>Try different sets of armors and weapons.<br/></li><li>Avoid deadly traps.<br/></li><li>Find useful items.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f61802ec1d399b6428af3e0019b8093.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ocaso Creations"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ocaso Creations"], "esrb_rating": null}
