They attract or repel and they have chemical reactions when they touch. You can drag particles into the analyser on the left and press the button to print a reaction table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reactions can look very lifelike. Sometimes a universe contains a creature with something that looks like a metabolism: one particle goes in, is turned into another particle\u00a0and propels the creature forward. All following from simple rules.</p>\n<p>It is based on a video by CodeParade called Particle Life.\u00a0 If you set the reaction speed to 0, my simulation will be identical to his.</p>\r\n\r\nWhat are these parameters?\r\n<p><strong>Temperature\u00a0</strong>Determines how much the particles want to move</p>\n<p><strong>Reaction Speed\u00a0</strong>How many reactions happen per time unit<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Force Magnitude\u00a0</strong>How strong the interactions between particles are</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum/Maximum Radius\u00a0</strong>Minimum/Maximum distance for interactions between particles<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Number of Elements\u00a0</strong>The amount of particle types. Amount of atoms in the periodic table</p>\n<p>And then the seeds! You can share or save\u00a0universes by copying the seed and typing it into the seed box. Make sure that the number of elements is the same, or it will give completely different results.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Frans (Concept and Name)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/43102f235e2b5393e070849d59c9255c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["buddhaman"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
