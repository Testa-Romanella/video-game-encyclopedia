I think that is good enough to count as an enhancement!</p>\n<p> <br/>The soundtrack is probably the only good thing about this game, however. Like a lot of my early games, it's marred by a sense of wierd surrealness, both in the scenes, mechanics, and especially the writing, and while some people love this stuff, I do not consider it very good game design. It's also buggy and quite cryptic, and its hard to figure out what you are supposed to do, and why are you selling waffles to an invading military force anyway? There is little sense to be found anywhere, but it is still a fun curiosity. To this game's credit, it does introduce a lot of characters who later become staples in most of the games that follow, like the constant villainous birds, the waffles, and other such tropes which are now important parts of the Super Wonderful Puppyland universe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df8ce2cda29c58e2e7a2bf8fcc37f50d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Spring Spring"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
