Alexander the Great died on 13 June 323 B.C., leaving no heir. Perhaps foreseeing the many great conflicts that would follow his demise, he left the Macedonian Kingdom 'To the best man'. These lands, spanning most of the known world, were divided between his former generals, who saw themselves as rightful Successors (or 'Diadochi') to the Kingdom. The Successors plunged into a maelstrom of epic conflict as they fought for power and glory. Now you have the opportunity to reign supreme over your rivals, if you can first defeat them on the battlefield. Use units such as Greek Pikemen, Macedonian Pikemen, Spearmen, Archers, Indian Elephants, Chariots, Cavalry, and Javelinmen to engage in some of the largest battles of the ancient world. <br/><br/>This is the most comprehensive and accurate Ancient Battle system on the Apple App Store.<br/>Key Game Features:<br/><br/>\u2022 High Definition Ancient Era Graphics.<br/>\u2022 7 Mission Tutorial Campaign.<br/>\u2022 6 Mission Wars of the Successors Campaign; Featuring the battles of The Hellespont, Cretopolis, Paraetacene, Gabiene, Salamis and Ipsus.<br/>\u2022 5 Mission Pyrrhic War Campaign; Featuring the battles of Siris River, Heraclea, Asculum, Asculum Satrianum &amp; Beneventum.<br/>\u2022 5 Mission Ascent of Rome Campaign; Featuring the battles of The Aous River, Cynoscephalae, Magnesia, Pydna &amp; Corinth.<br/>\u2022 5 Mission Eclipse Campaign; Featuring the battles of Thermopylae Plain, Lamia, Crannon, Sellasia &amp; Raphia.<br/><br/>Bonus Mission (Available for free by registering)<br/>\u2022 1 Mission Ptolemies Campaign; Featuring the battle of Gaza.<br/><br/>\u2022 All missions, except the tutorial, can be played as both sides. <br/>\u2022 66 Unique Ancient Units.<br/>\u2022 Detailed Combat Analysis<br/>\u2022 Flank Attacks<br/>\u2022 Strategic Movement.<br/>\u2022 Hours of Gameplay.<br/>\u2022 Game Center Achievements and Leaderboards.<br/>\u2022 iCloud saves (also compatible with the Apple Mac version of the game).<br/>\u2022 Map Zoom.<br/><br/>Find us on Facebook - facebook.com/hexwar<br/>Follow us on Twitter - @HexWarGames<br/>Game Forum \u2013 forums.hexwar.com<br/><br/>Thank you for supporting our games! <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/7439d22799b7c0a42c8ff5f1744d044d_zr0bLiT.jpg", "website": "http://facebook.com/huntedcow", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hunted Cow Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Hunted Cow Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
