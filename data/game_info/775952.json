VIDEO POKER!</p>\n<p>This is a simple video poker game I wrote over a few days in 2020 as\u00a0part of an interactive media jam. \u00a0Because of the time constraint, it\u00a0lacks some polish, such as a launcher card, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Code and writing:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Me.</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the graphics were made or edited by my daughter Eliza, who was\u00a010 at the time. \u00a0Others are by me.</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Fancy Family by Rafael Krux</p>\n<p>https://music.orchestralis.net/#!details?id=28566321</p>\n<p>Silly Intro by Alexander Nakarada</p>\n<p>https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com</p>\n<p>Comic Game Loop - Mischief by Kevin MacLeod</p>\n<p>https://freepd.com/comedy.php</p>\n<p>To the best of my knowledge these are all royalty-free tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I didn't make a note of where I got the sound effects\u00a0from, but I'm quite sure they were also from royalty-free or Creative\u00a0Commons sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Code notes:</strong></p>\n<p>I'm including the source code for educational purposes. \u00a0Please do not\u00a0rebrand this game (or its assets) as your own, or sell it. \u00a0It was written with a much earlier version of the Playdate SDK and\u00a0before I learned about Lua coroutines, so it is a lot messier than it\u00a0would be if I were to write it today. \u00a0:D</p>\n<p>Have fun\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T13:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/629/629c98ae70797eb582ee4dac67a7aeea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stevenf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
