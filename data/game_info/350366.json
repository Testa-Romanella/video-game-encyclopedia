{"id": 350366, "slug": "rise-the-vieneo-province", "name": "Rise: The Vieneo Province", "name_original": "Rise: The Vieneo Province", "description": "Rise is a MMO Space Simulator. The game is centered around a moon called Vieneo. The current game style does not lead you though any story line or tutorials. So its pretty much a sandbox setup for sci-fi role playing. They started developing on it again about a year ago with a new server and the expectation to offer VR soon!<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this game is to have fun flying scifi spaceships and trade your way to riches. Players start out with a taxi making small amounts of credits. Eventually with some help from other players you may make it up to and E10 spacecraft hauling a variety of materials and passengers. Once you profit enough from passenger runs move onto buying property,constructing buildings and mining ores.<br/><br/>I have logged many hours in game. Most of them just hanging out. When I do fly I stick with the E-10 since it hauls the most cargo. Passenger runs from the city Deois to Easydock space station are probably one of the best ways to make credits.<br/><br/>If you are hardcore enough you should definitely check out this game. At the very least it should stir up your imagination.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t be worried by the lack of players. The glass is half full and less players means more property available to purchase and mine.<br/><br/>The game is free with special incentives and opportunities for players while in Steam Early Access.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/><br/><ul><li>Unique Game Engine \u2013 Explore this huge world in a first person, vehicle focused view. With such a massive world and so much to see, you could make an entire game out of just traveling around.<br/><br/></li><li>Construct Cities \u2013 Colonists arriving to Vieneo need help getting settled and beginning their new lives. You can assist them in developing thriving cities in secure, prosperous locations.<br/><br/></li><li>Trade And Manipulate \u2013 Helping your cities become profitable by carefully shaping their economy is in your best interests. Trade between stations is key to making your fortune.<br/><br/></li><li>Space As Never Before \u2013 Fly into space and experience a physics-correct orbital engine, and see the stars as few ever will. However, you must be careful; space travel is no place for mistakes!<br/><br/></li><li>Protect Your Reputation \u2013 You have a reputation as a pilot and entrepreneur, and it impacts the opportunities available to you. If you have a reputation for crashing your ship, for instance, passengers will be very reluctant to fly with you!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T13:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/306cf613ec5a35f10065379ac65920e4.jpg", "website": "http://www.risetvp.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unistellar Industries", "unistellar"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unistellar Industries"], "esrb_rating": null}
