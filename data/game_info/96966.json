Incidentally, I was looking to meld my burgeoning interests in level and environmental design alongside my experience as a music producer.</p><p>This level is the result of this first foray.  Each of the personalities of the band, Hirshi, Kroba and Cosmo D (myself) are represented in various ways throughout this level.  I use a technique known as 'verical mixing' to bring out various aspects of the song depending on where you are in the level.</p><p>This game serves as a window into the imagination of the band and its soundworld and is basically a template for where I could take this idea next.
