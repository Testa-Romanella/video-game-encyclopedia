Dan's is the hardest, on account of his terrible autofire. That's what you get for having a SOCOM!<br/>- Fixed a collision bug on the last boss.\u00a0<br/>- Fixed the resolution of the hit effect for large enemies.<br/>- Keyboard inputs are as follow:<br/>WASD, Space (jump),\u00a0Shift (shoot)\u00a0and Ctrl (hold)\u00a0for P1<br/>Arrow keys, Numpad\u00a00 (jump), Numpad 1 (hold), and Numpad 2 (shoot) for P2<br/>Only P1 (space) can go through dialogs!<br/>I'm open to feedback to improve those inputs!</p>\n<br/>v1.0\r\n<p>Feel free to drop a comment with any found issue!\u00a0<br/>Keyboard mapping is terrible at the moment, and will be addressed in a future update,\u00a0 after the jam is over.<br/>If you get stuck, or are curious, you can use Numpad 1 through 4 to load specific levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for not spoiling/tagging members of Giant Bomb! I'd love to see their genuine reaction if they do a stream, and would rather not have them know what they get into.
