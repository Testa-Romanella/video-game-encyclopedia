What even IS this game!?\" <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to Platboarder, a niche game that doesn't just revel in its own identity crisis, it waltzes right into it wearing mismatched socks! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRolling the dice isn't just a way to move, it's a way of life. Will you play your cards right or just end up with handful of regrets? Can you dodge the dangers or will you trip over your own ego? Don't let the adorably cuteness of this game fool you, at the heart of this simple-seeming dice and card game lays strategies only a few will discover, let alone master. The Queen is waiting for you to prove your worth. So, are you ready to roll?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd if all else fails, you can just spend two hours tickling the pawn.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlatboarder is a little passion project by indie devs, so new gameplay features, levels, and weird fun will continue to be added over time. The journey doesn't end here!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T03:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe4/fe426e5e8a9f32f2ee560c7d66cba629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Gnaw Paw Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gnaw Paw Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
