The themes were CONTACT and EDGES. We merged the idea of reaching the end of the world and the idea of trying to bring a message in a desolated environnement. As it was a mini jam of 8h, we cuted some ideas, like the survival part, with a stamina bar for resisting cold,\u00a0 having several houses where you have to find the right person the letter is destined to and could rest. Those are ideas where the prototype could evolve. We were inspired by Terranigma for the setting.<br/></p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>- David Laskey (@david_laskey)</p>\n<p>- Christophe Galati (@ChrisDeneos)</p>\n<p>- Marie-Aurore Morfoisse</p>\n<p>- Liu Chang (@Nanoka)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b67c5c27fee46c43e8fd75492da34c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisDeneos"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
