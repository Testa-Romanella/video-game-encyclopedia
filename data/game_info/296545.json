Unfortunatly as usual I left game design polish for last so the game might be a bit unbalanced right now, I'd be happy to hear your feedbacks / suggestions.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no best score management yet so you'll just have to note it somewhere or do screenshot. My personal best (take that with a grain of salt tho, I know all the combination but was also dead tired) is 295. You'll most probably need a few tries before you win in order to figure out the 'recipes'. There are supposed to be somewhat logical but you still might have a hard time, hope you don't struggle to much tho.<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made with :</p>\n<ul><li>Engine : Godot 3.1</li><li>Art : Clip Paint Studio (clearly not fit for game jams, jesus exporting separate layers is absolute hell)</li><li>Music : None sorry, didn't have time. Hope you'll forgive me, I did have time for some really fine voicecrafted sfx.</li><li>SFX : My voice and some Audacity effects.</li><li>Font : Storybook</li></ul>\n<p>Except for the font I did everything.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Customers will ask you for scrolls.</p>\n<p>You have to combine elements to create scrolls (either two or three, it's written in the scroll name).</p>\n<p>You can cancel the elements you chose if you made a mistake or submit it if you think it is the good combination</p>\n<p>You have to guess the elements from the name of the scroll and complete enough requests to get 200 reputation points.</p>\n<p>If you can't find the combination you can always reject the customer's request but you will lose some reputation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T03:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/3733692ac27dae90c55f4b9196d7a333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ashtrail"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
