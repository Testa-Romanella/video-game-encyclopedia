Challenge your friends in a top-down shooter where you try to blast them off the island using a variety of powerups that you combine for even more mayhem. Can you be the last slime standing as the island collapses around you?<h3>MULTIPLAYER MAYHEM</h3>Engage in fast-paced top-down cannon combat against up to 5 of your friends!<br/><h3>DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENT</h3>The rocks around the level are no match for the firepower of your cannons and will quickly collapse. But be careful, as they might be the only thing standing between you and the fishes.<br/><h3>POWERUPS</h3>Collect treasures to power up your cannon or barrels and ammo boxes that augment your projectiles. These can all be combined to gain an advantage against your opponents. <br/><h3>CAN SLIMES FLY?</h3>No. You can, however, pretend to, at least for a moment, by using your cannon to propel yourself through the air.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T02:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49a/49a67de6693153334f22abd248dffcf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chaotic Pendulum"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chaotic Pendulum"], "esrb_rating": null}
