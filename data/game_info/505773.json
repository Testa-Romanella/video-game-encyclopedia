No, that is not a typo.</p>\n<p>This is an early prototype. There are no proper graphics yet, but the game should be fully functional. A graphics version is planned, but there are no hard promises. Build a kingdom of dargons and collect shinies. Spend those shinies on various uprades that will help produce even more shinies.

Specifically bipedal, no wings, a breath weapon of any element (that isn't fire), and no natural innate magical ability (though this does not stop them from using magical artifact). - In case you didn't get it, it's a satire on how seriously people argue about dragon archetypes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T05:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e1d3c44ac967569b4c71d767acf71f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DargsyWargon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
