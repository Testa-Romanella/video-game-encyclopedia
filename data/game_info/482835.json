This game was created during my game-a-week class were we made a different game each week. This one was one of my favorites so I chose it as my one to publish.</p>\n<p>When we were given the topic or Mechanic to build around Ten seconds of life I could not piece together what would be a fun way to proceed. First I drew from what I knew in this case it was games like \"Minit\" and \"Half Minute Hero\" but each of those games are Rpg's which is not something I wanted to make and I was using construct which has its own limitations as I have the free version. That in mind I knew I was going to do a platformer but how I would implement the rule and make it fun I did not know. After my second class were we bounced idea's off of each other and I had a better Idea of were to take it.</p>\n<p>Making it was pretty fun due to time constraints (having one week) and trying to get all the features I wanted into the game was a challenge. I sadly did not get all the features that I wanted into the game mostly due to construct free limit of events. The first version of this had\u00a0was bare bones in that it was just the coins and the player collect them all and make it to the end then you win. Now as I revisited it I added enemies and gave the player an attack they could use to kill the enemies as well as destructible walls. For me as a inspiring game designer construct is definitely a engine I can get behind and use as its all logic based. I probably will wind up buying Construct 2 as I wish to have unlimited events because that was a definite hamper on what i could put in the game on my second time around.</p>\n<p>I personal love platformer as they were the first game type I started on so when making this I knew the stage had to be fun but also complete in ten seconds. My first iteration had just back and forth and although it worked for the ten second timer it sucked during play-test. So all of the level was made through a series of trial and error getting the best route while trying to maintain the fun factor. This was done for the first version were I had no enemies or walls then when I decided to add those elements I did the same thing but instead of warping the landscape I put enemies were they felt right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Polishing this up was fun getting to add more features that I couldn't in the first week was nice. Now there was some hiccups that happened in this process. The biggest one and the one I tried to correct the most was when you shoot the player goes up and some animation issues ensued that I just could not find away to fix. Other then this one issue the rest of the work done was good and I believe added to the value of the game itself. The polish was cut short due to the events limit in construct three but all in all It went well and the game has benefited from it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:39:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae95e28bedcabf84b8ae020bb8ab541d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plasmamts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
