Your job is to remotely guide the spaceships to a safe landing. In order to do so you will have to rely on the facts that you know about the spaceship (angle of rotation, distance, horizontal and vertical speed), since sometimes it will go off screen and you won't see it! You will need to make smart and fuel-efficient moves.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Levels are endlessly generated</strong> by randomly assigning new positions to the landing station and the spacecraft, and picking\u00a0one of <strong>12 possible bacgrounds</strong>.</li><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Arrow Keys.</li><li>With every mission that you successfully complete you will be<strong> adding points to your score</strong>. The score takes into account the fuel that you have left and how 'centered' and smooth was your landing.</li></ul>\n<p>If you reach <strong>1000 points</strong> you can consider yourself a <strong>Spacecraft Navigation Master</strong>!</p>\n<p>Good luck! Please comment any suggestions / ideas, and your highscore if you want.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Images from Freepik: Spaceship designed by macrovector and Landing station created by brgfx.</li><li>\u00a0Sound effects by Shapeforms Audio and KronBits.\u00a0</li><li>\r\nBackground space scenes by Screaming Brain Studios\u00a0 and DinVStudio. </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T12:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ce/1ce75b24a83ff81c8a6baa4676622814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["josueAC"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
