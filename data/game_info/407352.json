The game itself is very simplistic and requires the bare minimum of hardware to run. You can customize the lotto win rules to match your local lottery.\u00a0<br/><br/>There are two modes currently implemented:<br/>Single\u00a0Roll - You roll once, imagine this as going to the store and buying a single ticket. You can reroll from this menu as many times as you would like.<br/><br/>Multi-Roll (Go until you win) - The game rolls FOR you as many times as it can per second (dependent on your FPS). This mode was implemented to give you an idea as to just how crazy the chances are... even if you could afford to buy 60+ tickets PER SECOND.\u00a0<br/><br/>Options Menu:\u00a0<br/>Match To Win - Set the amount of matching numbers required to win (1-6)<br/>VSync - Set on or off.\u00a0<br/>$ Per Ticket - Press on the currently displayed number (default - 5) to adjust the \"cost\"\u00a0per virtual ticket.<br/><br/>In the multi-roll mode the game automatically calculates the total amount spent with a simple formula (Rolls * TicketCost = $).<br/><br/>This is a side project I'm working on mostly for fun, it may get constant updates... it may never get updated again. If you enjoy it, feel free to share it. Regardless, I\u00a0hope you have fun... and I\u00a0also hope this can help convince you to stop wasting money on lotto tickets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>***DISCLAIMER: WINNING IN THE GAME IS NOT THE SAME AS WINNING IN REAL LIFE.\u00a0THIS IS A GAME.\u00a0NOTHING IS ACTUALLY BEING \"WON\".***<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adf1a7465734eb8172b2d9956c19ecf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C27 Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
