It purchases, modifies, and sells planets across known space - no questions asked. As a fresh employee, you are opening a new branch in a recently opened region of hyperspace. You will be building a network of geomantic rails to connect the guild resources to your customers' desires. Making deliveries will earn new capabilities in the form of spending capital to buy new components. As you learn, you will create intricate networks, tweak each placement to improve reliability, and aim for even greater heights - or just build whatever giant process tickles your fancy.<br/><br/>In exploring the abstract dreamlike-world of hyperspace, you will make new acquaintances among your customers and learn their preferences. Making deliveries will earn the favor of those you serve. With time and effort, you can become a preferred supplier. This will open up new opportunities through information, introductions, and even personal hyperspace enhancements. Unfortunately, not everyone is on amicable terms, so as you acquire each new friendship, you will earn others' suspicion.<br/><br/>As you gain familiarity with your new territory, you can begin to explore the greater mysteries. You might explore the outer ring and make new acquaintances further and further from the hub. You might investigate the local hyperspace anomalies. You might find new ways to utilize the capabilities of your geomantic rails.<br/><br/><ul><li>Construct: build a network of rails and parts in three dimensions<br/></li><li>Adjust: tweak slopes and positions to improve speed and reliability<br/></li><li>Automate: make intricate plans with production loops and alternate paths<br/></li><li>Profit: deliver planets to buyers to increase your budget and capital<br/></li><li>Interact: improve your relationship with your customers<br/></li><li>Advance: unlock new parts, buy more, and enhance your own powers<br/></li><li>Expand: open new territories and gain access to even more customers<br/></li><li>Survive: avoid the hazards of hyperspace and learn new tricks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T02:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/991b543d1f1cb64b35bc359b6c4c482e.jpg", "website": "http://fuzzycube.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["FuzzyCube"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FuzzyCube"], "esrb_rating": null}
