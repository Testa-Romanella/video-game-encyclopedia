In this game demo, play through 3 timed stages and serve the hungry raccoons their food, then take their bills. When you clear all the tables, you win!</p><p>How to play:</p><p>Bring the hungry raccoons a food item if they are not currently eating (their tails will be wagging if they are hungry)</p><p>If you bug them while they are currently eating or you have no food, you get a strike!</p><p>3 Strikes = Game over!<br/></p>\n<p>(NOTE: This is... very glitchy. please do your best to make save states if possible. Sprite overflowing can happen easily if too many raccoons are asking for the bill on screen, or if too many raccoons bills are taken at the same time. The game is horribly optimized, but there just wasn't enough time to fix the 10fps framerate.)</p>\n<p>If this is received well, We will make a full game out of it!</p>\n<p>Thanks a bunch to Trominal for this awesome game jam!!</p>\n<p>Made by Medi, Four Operator, and Skittles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T10:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d012ea0178f5c093a2c092d910f3d33f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Repugnant Bounty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
