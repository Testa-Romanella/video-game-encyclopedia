{"id": 135616, "slug": "knights-dungeon", "name": "Knight's Dungeon", "name_original": "Knight's Dungeon", "description": "<p>Knight's Dungeon is a puzzle game where you must solve word, number, color, push-block, and music puzzles to advance through the dungeon. You use an in-game journal to automatically record information as you find it. Hints can be obtained in the game by playing a parallel game. 10 hours minimum of challenging and original puzzles! <br/><br/>It was influenced by games like Myst and Legend of Zelda. This game was started because most puzzles in games are far too easy and seem to be targeted at a much younger audience. This is a game for people who don't want to spend only a few seconds trying to solve a puzzle. There is no combat, leveling, or even a menu in this game; just puzzles.<br/><br/>I made the game in RPG Maker VX. I did the music and graphics myself. All puzzles in the game are by me. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a6/8a6da754a1e210a729b5815bc4f9baed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["knightsdungeon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
