{"id": 713086, "slug": "midnight-escapade", "name": "Midnight Escapade", "name_original": "Midnight Escapade", "description": "<p>This game is a lane runner where the player will be trying to escape the police in Chicago whilst avoiding obstacles that would slow down the player if hit. Shadows work with a dual nature; they help the player evade and escape while simultaneously hindering the player by hiding obstacles from their vision. These shadows can only be removed by the police car following the player or the street lamps at set intervals within the level, adding difficulty. To escape the police and enter the next level, the player must use the shadows to increase their distance from the police. This distance will keep increasing until the signs of the police will no longer be seen. There are three levels in total, each getting harder and changing the setting. Levels will vary from running away from police down a road to running away on a dock in the final level.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Lead Programmer\u00a0- Olly Smith<br/>Lead Producer \t\t- Isabel Elia\u00a0<br/>Lead Designer\t\t\t- David Toussaint<br/>Designer\t\t\t- Archie Bigsby-Thompson<br/>Lead Narrative Designer\t- Archie Bigsby-Thompson<br/>Sound Designer\t\t- David Toussaint<br/>Lead Artist/Character Artist\u00a0\t\t\t- Fiona Chung<br/>UI Artist \t\t\t-Najwa Gutale<br/>3D Artist \t\t\t- Danni Bovell<br/>2D Artist\t\t\t- Archie Bigsby-Thompson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef1bf3f5964dbf78edbfaefbe41b060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BelleHathNoFury"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
