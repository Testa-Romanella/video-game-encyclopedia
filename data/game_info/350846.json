You'll need to wall jump, and slash your way through 6 stages of challenging narrow saw blade corridors, security droids and lasers while grabbing as much scrap as you can.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple but hard to master. You can Jump and attack (if you can find the hidden Kaizo blade). <br/>Collect hidden and hard to reach scrap to get %100 completion. <br/><br/>Ikeda: The Scrap Hunter is a challenging stage based game with no micro transactions or loot box shenanigans.<br/><br/>Approximate time time to complete is 45 minutes if you're a pro at these sorts of games. But to get 100% of collectibles may take up to 5-6 hours.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf9b5b535c1859f2d19b5b1e9d3a8e2.jpg", "website": "http://www.Aquatic-moon.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trent Kaniuga"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aquatic Moon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
