You have struggled for years, drifting from job to job, nearing bankrupcy so many times. Then, one day, you have an idea. You decide to hold a puppet show. You do that and start getting money, a little at first, then it\u00a0 gets more and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game mechanics:</p>\n<p>Press Host a show to get more money. The more money you have, the more money you will get from hosting a show. However, when you host a show, people get poorer and poorer. If you press 'Host a show' too many times, people will have no money and you will lose. So once you have pressed 'Host a show' more than 11 times, you can press 'Allow people to get money', and people will get rich again. You can then host a show 11 more times.</p>\n<p>However, hosting a show will cost 10 money. If you have no money you will lose, so be careful. You can also hire workers to work for you, which costs money, but gives you more money, which in turn gives you a bigger street show.</p>\n<p>Th aim of the game is to get a circus. When you have done that, you win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed5cef2d410ea410ea7e510c239df143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChilliTech"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
