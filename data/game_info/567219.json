I created it with the help of the Unity 3D Game Developer on Udemy. However, I expanded a lot on it, by adding two new enemies and towers, a lot of levels and custom UI. I hope you'll enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>There is an <strong>in-game tutoria</strong><strong>l</strong>, but if it is not enough, here is a full one.\u00a0You can place a tower by left clicking on it and clicking on a free block which is not the path (colored in blue). Your goal is to stop every enemy from reaching the orange base, otherwise the orange health bar will decrease. If it falls all the way to 0, you lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating System:</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of each level your actions will be rated with stars, you will get three stars if you win with a full health bar, two if the health bar is less than full and one if it is less than half.</p>\n<p><strong>Tower Limitations:</strong></p>\n<p>In some later levels there will be a limitation on how many specific towers you can place at once. The amount can be seen left to the tower UI image.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or just want to give me some honest feedback be sure to leave a comment, I'd love to hear your opinion!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T08:40:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b42/b429199783c196c0f9a9d39949e9062e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astutos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
