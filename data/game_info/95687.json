A visual novel by Scylez!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We have a short demo showcasing a little of what the game will become. It\u2019s live and playable right now!\u00a0 This is just a demo! The writing is bad and the art is incomplete, but it showcases the vision ahead! <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>So what\u2019s in this demo?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This demo contains the first on 23 planned scenes for this visual novel. You\u2019ll meet 4 of the 9 planned romance options. The 22 other scenes and 20 dates with the romance options are being written and implemented at this moment. This first scene has a few different endings depending on your actions and decisions.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>What will be in the main game?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>In the main game will have those 23 scenes, 9 romance option (dragons, raptor, feline, deer, wolf, shark, stallion,cheetah\u00a0), and 22 available dates with the characters. Your actions and answers to answers will affect who you spend time with, and each characters affection towards you. These actions and affection will affect who you spend your dates with, and different dialogue you\u2019ll see. Each character is being written to have their own personality; backstory, issues, and moral dilemmas that you will have to either help solve or hamper. At the end of the game maybe things will turn out great for you and someone else, or maybe not.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Can I help or contribute?</strong></li></ul>\n<p>This is all completely 100% optional. Just reading this journal this far means a lot to me. The biggest thing you can do is share the journal or the link to the game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you play it give me feedback! Tell me things you\u2019d like to see, things you think would make it better. Playing the demo will make me happier than ever!\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>This game will come out and will be free to play</strong>\u00a0and I will be working on it in my spare time to get it up and completed. I have some very amazing people helping me out but still there\u2019s a lot of writing, and artwork to be done. That\u2019s why if you\u2019d like to help its development and donate I would be more than grateful. <strong>Anyone who donates $5 or more will get their name in the credits, and their character put in the background of one of the scenes.\u00a0</strong> I\u2019ll also be putting up some YCH auctions up for some cameo appearances where your character can have a few lines. No humans or registered characters though. Any funds will go towards better art music and assets for the game!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Right now I have to be looking for royalty free music to put in the game, which isn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. If you\u2019re a music composer and would be interested in making some music to be in the game send me your rates and demos, and I\u2019ll see what I can afford on my small budget\r\n  </p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a writer or specialize in stories or character development and would like to help out with the story or give suggestions or input that would be nice to get some extra opinions as well.   </p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to make this game available in as many languages as possible, but I don\u2019t know any other languages well enough to translate. So if there are some bi or multilingual folks who would be looking for translation work let me know as well!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Depending on if I can manage to raise any funds for the game, maybe I can afford to commission some special art for some of the scenes too. Unless someone is willing to do it for cheap or free but I highly doubt that.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li><strong>When will it release?\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<p>The game will release hopefully sometime later this year. I have no specific date as I\u2019ll be drawing the art, writing the script, and programming the game in-between my commissions and freelance work. But I promise you as soon as it\u2019s released I\u2019ll be putting a post-up on every profile I have and I\u2019ll be working very hard on it because I\u2019m very excited to get it out and show it to everyone! I try to work on it at least a little bit each day, either doing art, writing a little bit for the script, or programming a feature I need.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0This game will release on the web and have a PC standalone. Maybe a Linux and Mac build depending on some things, and hopefully I'll be able to get an android build out there too!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Making games has always been my biggest passion, and has lead me to creating art.\u00a0 Now I have the chance to mix my biggest passion with my favorite fandom and create something I\u2019m excited to share.   </p>\n<p>And a special thank you to my good friends Drackey, BlinkinStar, and maddog197x for being an amazing help</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3d52976e043d6eccbd5f7c6580873b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Scylez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
