Imagine some text so compelling that it will stop you from purchasing that $60 AAA title that has 4 different versions that increase it's price tag to upwards of $120 and those sexy DLC/Season Passes. Can't make a game in 2017 without some Season Pass that make you regret your life choices that have lead up to this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here you would find some long paragraph that tries to explain the story and get you to care more about the game and make you forget that you're really just a spinning square destroying other bits of floating gameobjects with data stored in them about their movement speed, health and such.</p>\n<p>And now for some credits. \u00a0I give all credit to my College/University, they helped me learn that school is a load of hot garbage that got me into massive debt instead of just logging onto Udemy and purchasing dope courses like Machine Learning and Web Developer Bootcamp for like only $15 each. Like what the hell, only $15 for a course that costed me over $10k+ at a university to take? Whatever tho. Unity is sick, better than Unreal. Suck that Alex</p>\n<p>Also thanks to Eric Benaim for making the great song you hear during the actual level. The first song I\u00a0grabbed it from Epidemic Sound but I'm gonna replace that in a little while.</p>\n<p>Atm I'm working on some sick boss fights and restructuring how the gameplays to make everything faster and more intense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c52041534f1980fd84ab95641374ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KnightShift"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
