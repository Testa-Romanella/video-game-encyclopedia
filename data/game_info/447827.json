Instead of Artyom, players will have the chance to see through the eyes of a brand new character and of one of the Spartan Rangers, the Aurora\u2019s only American, Sam. \n\nThe Two Colonels \nJust below the surface, under the dead city of Novosibirsk, Colonel Khlebnikov makes his way home to his son, Kirill, for New Years Eve. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all is not well with the people here: the slime is further consuming the tunnels, mutant attacks appear to be on the rise and the precious \u2018green stuff\u2019 that protects the people from radiation poisoning is running low. In order to secure the survival of any of the people, those in charge may need to take drastic measures\u2026 \n<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the journey and experiences of Khlebnikov during the last days of life in Novosibirsk, which Colonel Miller retraces a year later, players can expect the classic story-driven gameplay of the Metro series in this new linear chapter, complete with a brand new weapon, the deadly flame-thrower, claustrophobic environments, and the all-too-familiar hair-raising tension.\n\nSam\u2019s Story \nSam, a US marine at the Moscow embassy before the bombs were dropped, has long dreamed of returning to his homeland, and maybe finding his family alive. The prospect seemed impossible in the darkened tunnels of the Metro, but when the Spartans discovered that Moscow was not the only city left alive after the war, holding out hope didn\u2019t feel so foolish anymore. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nSam makes his way away from the Aurora in search of a way back to the USA, arriving at the remains of Vladivostok\u2019s tsunami ravaged harbours, ruined industrial buildings, and crumbling residential districts.\u00a0 To complete his journey, Sam will discover that he needs every tactic he has learned so far to survive, as his surroundings prove to be far trickier than expected. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers will forge Sam's path through the sandbox survival landscape of Vladivostok, as they take a brand new journey across the wasteland of post-apocalyptic Russia", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T02:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b620be399d27a3f3e42b27a34b90831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4A Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": null}
