To take on foul beasts in search of treasure, glory, and the fate of the world? Well, you probably don't if you haven't had a balanced breakfast! Or lunch! Or second breakfast!\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's where CONSUMO comes in. Your job is to keep the adventurers nice and fed throughout their battles. The meals you cook for them can heal them or enhance their attributes, or\u00a0<em>both</em> if you concoct the right recipes! Feel free to cook up whatever your heart desires, but certain ingredients will only change certain stats!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the pre-alpha! Wow!!! What's available now is a free demo that includes a tutorial and a basic level. We have a\u00a0<em>lot</em> more ideas on what we want to include in this game, but we finally got a playable version out, and development will be continuing into the future. Be sure to check here for updates!<br/></p>\n<p>This demo build only only contains one fight and one cooking vessel. More are on the way!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - move player/throw direction</li><li>SPACE - jump</li><li>LEFT CLICK - hold/throw left item</li><li>RIGHT CLICK - hold/throw right item</li><li>SHIFT - precise aim</li><li>E - interact/chop food</li><li>Q - inventory (<em>super\u00a0</em>not finished, currently only works with mouse and keyboard)</li><li>ESC - pause</li></ul>\n<p>There\u00a0<em>is</em> gamepad support, but it's currently limited. Thank you for your patience.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nList of Known Bugs:\r\n<ul><li>If gamepad is used, unplugging mid game will crash the game.\r\n</li><li>Soups will sometimes render in front of dialog boxes.</li><li>On second playthough, musical cues do not work.</li></ul>\n<p>I expect this list will grow some time soon. If you notice any while playing, please let us know!</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Director:</strong>\u00a0Charles Painter</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Programmer:</strong>\u00a0Seth Burchfield\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Character/Enemy Design:</strong>\u00a0Myung Sub Cho\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Quality Testing:</strong>\u00a0Jackson Moore</p>\n<p><strong>Menu Design:</strong>\u00a0Phillip Jauregui\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Design</strong>: Zac Chin</p>\n<p><strong>Player Design</strong>: Joshua Wyatt</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seth Burchfield\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jackson Moore\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phillip Jauregui\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zac Chin\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles Painter</p>\n\n<p><strong>Art:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Myung\u00a0Sub Cho\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joshua Wyatt</p>\n<p>Seth Burchfield</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Music/Sound:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Johnny Wagner\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seth Burchfield</p>\n\n<p><strong>Design:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jackson Moore\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joshua Wyatt\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason Karnes\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seth Burchfield</p>\n<p>Charles Painter</p>\n\n<p><strong>Writing:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charles Painter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad9/ad996f0b186a767e0b7754b721718445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team TreeFish"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
