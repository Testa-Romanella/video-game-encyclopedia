I made my first game when I was 14 years old. Then I made some games at that time. And after that when I turned 15 I deleted all those awful flash games. But then in 2017 I found my passion back on game development and at that point using gamemaker studio 1.4 I made this game, Defend The Planet. This game is made by following a bunch of tutorials.</p><p>It might seem like another asteroid clone, but this is much more to me...</p><p>Everything is this game is made by me, (Including Sound and Art)</p><p>I want to thank those youtubers without whom this game was impossible to be made... Their tutorials helped me a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af00b08e879ba05d7bd796a4060521cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paperback Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
