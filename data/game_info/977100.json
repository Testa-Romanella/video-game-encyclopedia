He's found the perfect match for all of blobdom, but he didn't know the bouncy blobs can't turn on their own! Love is within reach, but they're all looking in the wrong direction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That's where you come in: it's your job to spin them around until two matching blobs are facing each other. When they lock eyes on their one true love, they'll roll forward and dissolve into each other. Dreamy!<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you want to make light work of Cupid's calamity, you can prepare combos to turn each level into an unashamed lovefest. Just line up blobs that have an obstacle in their way and the star-cross'd blobs will seek each other out once it disappears from the level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course there's nothing simple about love, and the blobs come in a multitude of flavours. Some are a little greedier than others and want to find two loves-of-their-life. Others fancy something a little less straightforward and will will fall for blobs not only of their matching colour, but from across the spectrum of blobkind.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Features:</h3><br/><ul><li>160 hand-crafted levels of varying difficulties<br/></li><li>Three unique blob types to discover and master<br/></li><li>Four amazing sets, each with their own combination of blobs<br/></li><li>Target scores add replay value \u2013 can you beat the best score on every level?<br/></li><li>Original music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-19T04:22:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42a3212f4f9bc0da2e49de28c559485a.jpg", "website": "https://mountweazelgames.com/games/looking-for-love", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MountWeazel"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MountWeazel"], "esrb_rating": null}
