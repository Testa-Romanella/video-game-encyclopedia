Above all, this is a game about bad art.</p>\n<p>Embark on a perilous journey to find the coveted diamond of ambiguity, as well as rescue your precious lover. You are no ordinary... duck? Maybe a bird? A chicken? With a hat or helmet? Or is that supposed to be hair?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, along the way, you will have to overcome numerous obstacles! The most notable of which is the highly ambiguous art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But don't worry!\u00a0You can tell the game what each drawing is supposed to be using the SHIFT key, and the drawing's behavior will change to match your entry. You can do this as many times as you'd like, so don't hold back.\u00a0Is that black circle a rock? A pit? You decide! You can even try it on enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this means that sometimes your adventure will require changing the meaning of each drawing back and forth. Make good use of the ability to change the game world and your lover will be back in your arms in no time!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Arrow keys - move your character.</li><li>Spacebar - attack with your sword... or knife, or spoon, I don't know.</li><li>Shift - identify objects.</li><li>Tab - open inventory.</li><li>Enter - see instructions at any point in the game.</li><li>m - Mute/Unmute music</li><li>Esc - Quit game.</li></ul>\r\nIdentifying objects\r\n<p>If you see an object you want to identify, hold shift to make your cursor appear. Then use the arrow keys to move your cursor and place it on top of what you want to identify.\u00a0Release shift and write down what you think the object is. When you're done, press Enter.
