I\u00a0was given 4 weeks to replicate/iterate upon the mechanics of a side scroller of my choosing (Super Metroid) and design a level by myself. Part of the assignment was that we were only allowed to use basic materials with no textures. All of the models used were either imported from some of the 3D metroid games, are default unreal models, or were created by using Unreal's BSP brushes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!! Feel free to leave feedback!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c3/0c3edee8e2876bd1dd01baf575f4c428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luis Garcia Remes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
