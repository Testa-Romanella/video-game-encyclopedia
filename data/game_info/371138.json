Peacefully collect coins in this completely generic and featureless platformer and ignore the game slowly breaking itself!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>In actuality, it's a super meta game with quirky mechanics; you'll find out. It's about errors, missing textures, and a pudgey purple man with too small pockets.</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D to move. Space to jump. Click to shoot(?).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE THEME:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>This game is a liar</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>This game obviously pretends to be something it's not.\u00a0 It\u00a0deteriorates level by level, and lies to you about the mess it actually\u00a0is.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>ME:</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Marcus, and this is the first game I've ever actually completed. I've been working on game projects on and off\u00a0for the past two years, but never finished anything. Just submitting this\u00a0has already been a huge triumph for me, and I'm proud of the little game I made too.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>YOU:</strong></p>\n<p>THANKS FOR CHECKING OUT MY PAGE / GAME.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy! It's short and sweet, and I had a ton of fun letting this project consume me for the past week. Also please\u00a0feel free to give criticism and feedback, I'd love to hear what you think.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S THE SOUNDS\u00a0MIGHT BE LOUD, I'M SORRY IN ADVANCE.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>P.P.S Massive thank you to the hosts of this jam for teaching me literally everything I know about making games.</strong></p><p><strong>P.P.P.S There's a secret method to skip every level, try to figure it out ;)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T08:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b690592655f11a736cb8f35b408f489c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sabertoothxz"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
