It's free. And this is a very early prototype with a simple UI and only one song.\u00a0</em><em>Now go and make that song\u00a0yours.</em><strong><br/><br/>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>Use 1-8 keys on your keyboard to toggle loops on or off. You can also use the mouse, or touch on mobile devices!<br/><br/>For mobile devices, make sure you have it in <strong>LANDSCAPE MODE or everything will go to hell\u00a0</strong><strong>! <br/><br/>If you connect your speakers/headphones\u00a0through Bluetooth, a sailor dies. Or at least, you will get some delay and latency on the audio. Which is just as bad.</strong><br/><br/><strong>2022-01-03<br/><em>Version: 0.10 (added support for handheld)<br/><br/></em></strong>------------------------------------------<br/>Looking for FREE music for your projects?<br/>Check out my free music packs @\u00a0https://spaw.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d22/d22b64924804a91312a89f2d52130d04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SPAW Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
