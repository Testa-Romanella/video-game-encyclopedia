In order to help a sickly stranger named Sonata, Cadence will have to harness the magic of the Falsetto to jump between worlds. Players may choose to use musical spells such as destruction and charisma to get their way, or they may choose to instead befriend the people around them and never tap into their mysterious powers. The choice is up to you, but you must hurry. A greater power lurks in the silence of the shadows.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T02:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/71875322ac4b9dcec144802a56d8db0a.jpg", "website": "https://mayjstudios.weebly.com/sonata-theory.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mayj Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Mayj Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
