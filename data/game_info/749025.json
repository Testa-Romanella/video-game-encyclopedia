The player is the mayor of the town and has to administer it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He starts the game with a little city composed of few buildings and collecting few resources. To develop the city the player has to invest his resources to build and improve his buildings to increase his resource production.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The city would be neatly differentiated between the rich neighborhood and the poor one. In part, both the palette and the buildings themselves will be affected by the aforementioned propaganda, with houses of the rich being of certain colors and houses of the poor being of others. The same goes for factories, fields, and anything associated with this or that social class.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong>:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Build</strong></p>\n<p>The player can use his resources to build. To do it he can drag the building from a menu to the map to place it, or he can click on a point on the map and build it.</p>\n<p><strong>Upgrade</strong></p>\n<p> The player can use his resources to upgrade his buildings. To do it he has to click on the building and use the upgrade button.</p>\n<p><strong>Events (Resolve city problems)</strong></p>\n<p>As game time passes the labor unions and communists will incite workers to rebel, protest, and commit vandal acts. Those will be events the player has to choose how to resolve, for example, he can use police or increase workers\u2019 salaries. Different decisions for different events change the outputs. Outputs are only negative for the player (example: lose resources), but the choice changes the specifics of the losing.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPED BY:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TEAM X\r\n</p>\n<p>(EVENT HORIZON SCHOOL TURIN, YEAR 1, 2020/2021)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Alessandro Foddis</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Game Design:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Lukas Marchesi</li><li>Stefano Testa</li></ul>\n<p><strong>3D Art:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Filippo Toselli</li></ul>\n<p><strong>2D Art:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Eileen Risso</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:23:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46dfc6bed7dd0d279809097572003cbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Event Horizon School"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
