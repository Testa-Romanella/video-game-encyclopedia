Complete the objectives but beware of the shadowfish.<br/><br/>LEVELS<br/>In each level you have to complete one of four objectives: survive for a specified amount of time; quickly follow a trail of rings; clear checkpoints; eat food with caution to reach a specific amount of health. Every level is different, be it food quantity, goo quantity, speed, size, movement patterns, health lost rate, number and speed of shadowfish. All these combined make each level unique.<br/><br/>ARCADE<br/>Survive as long as possible. Arcade starts with lots of food and some goo, but over time the food gets more rare and more goo appears.
