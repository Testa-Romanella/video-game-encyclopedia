Namely, in every possible way corrects the past in order to be in a better present.<br />\nOf course, fixing the past is not an easy task. This is the responsibility of the military organization - the Super Time Force. Brave Commander Repeatski boldly sends time-traveling fighters to various points in time, including prehistoric times and the Middle Ages. Sometimes to improve the present he has to send fighters to the future - and Commander Repeatski does not stop before that.<br />\nThe matter is not limited to transferring fighters back and forth in time. Manipulate the time can not only Commander Repeatski, but also ordinary soldiers - they, too, can &quot;rewind&quot; the time forward or backward - for example, during the fight, &quot;cancel&quot; the wrong decision, be five minutes earlier and do everything as needed.<br />\nAnd one more useful thing is the slow motion mode, if at normal speed it is difficult to pass.<br />\nThe player has 30 lives. Levels are sufficiently filled with well-armed opponents, and so many lives - it&#39;s not so much. The characters you can play the game are sixteen. Everyone has his own weapon. And everyone can achieve six levels of skill.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2014-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b86c68a911ca1dd4828e22364e077ea.jpg", "website": "http://www.supertimeforce.com", "rating": 3.09, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 120, "owned": 1763, "beaten": 50, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 97, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 169, "ratings_count": 194, "suggestions_count": 439, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 194, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Capybara Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capybara Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
