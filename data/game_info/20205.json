Her confidence has sunk to an all time low.<br/>\r\nAs life pressures her toward giving up, will she forget why she pursued this craft in the first place? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWithout Within is a short visual novel that explores the creative mind. The game was released for free in Christmas 2014 as thanks to everyone for supporting my endeavors thus far. For those who kindly appreciate the experience and wish to make a contribution, there is an Extra Edition DLC that includes the soundtrack, a digital artbook, as well as three inspirational chase cards.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, being a free game, Without Within is unable to feature trading cards. Sorry Vinty!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you! I hope you will enjoy the read.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-11T22:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969472ff73af52ab4e077b0b8acecf8b.jpg", "website": "http://invertmouse.com", "rating": 2.72, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 19, "owned": 442, "beaten": 11, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 18, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["InvertMouse"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["InvertMouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
