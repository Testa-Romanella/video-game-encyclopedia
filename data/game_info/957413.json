Upon exiting your unfortunate looking machine you come face to face with an unruly looking dinosaur. Just as he\u2019s about to eat you, you panic and do the first thing that you can think of in this situation\u2026.recite Shakespeare. The dinosaur is so caught off guard that he stops mid roar and looks at you intrigued. Seeing that this has seemingly saved your life you continue to recite all the great works that you can think of: Hemingway, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Dr. Seuss... Now more and more dinosaurs have come to listen and you realize that the dinosaurs only wish to be educated and agree to help them learn. To upkeep this symbiotic relationship and avoid being eaten alive you take all of the books you\u2019ve carried with you (fortunately a lot), and open up a brand new library! Give the dinosaurs the books they desire or risk being eaten.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T20:24:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["justabrowser"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
