However, this is hardly the beginning of his nightmare... As he leaves this mysterious area, he only continues to find more and more puzzling sights, but none of it compares to the shock of realizing where, exactly, he is: a castle, perfectly decorated and maintained, in modern-day Russia.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Of course, though, he quickly finds he's not alone here. With him are fourteen other strangers, all around his age and without any connection to each other... or any idea what is going on. That is, until they meet the final person, an unusual man who introduces himself as \"the King of the Competition,\" and though this title sparks confusion at first, they soon learn what, exactly, he has planned for them: the Royal Competition of Death, a murder competition where the only way to win is to be the last person left alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Without knowing anything about his location, or about the King and the enigmatic organization he claims to have control over, Kostya is left with far too many questions, not a single answer, and no means of returning to his normal life. All he can hope for is that no one else will dare to start this Royal Competition, but it seems that's far too much to ask...</p>\r\n\u00a0 Who will be the last one standing?\r\n\n\r\n\u00a0 Credits\r\nCrimson Sugar Studio Team Members\r\n<p><strong>Mist</strong> - coding, music, writing, plot, character design &amp; creation</p>\n<p><strong>Dani</strong> - character art, background art, writing, plot, character design &amp; creation</p>\n\r\n\u00a0 Contact Us\r\n<p>Twitter - @crimsonsugarstd</p>\n<p>Email - crimsonsugarstudio@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:23:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e80b0fd9d71b484cfcd7e1f6f189376b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crimson Sugar Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
