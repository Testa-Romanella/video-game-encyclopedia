Drive around, land on planets, explore and take photos. Relax and enjoy the universe of Stardust Safary!</p>\n<p>This is a project created for personal educational purposes, with the aim of testing and gaining better experience with computer graphics techniques and the unity workflow in general. Said techniques include:</p>\n<ul><li>Prodedural planets and terrains.</li><li>Procedural texturing of the terrain, based on terrain height and slope.</li><li>Shader-based effects</li><li>Particle effects</li><li>UI</li><li>Operations with Unity Phisics Engine</li></ul>\n<p>This does not claim to be a full-game, it is currently more of an open-world sandbox for the players to enjoy. More features and full gameplay mechanics will be added in\u00a0 later stages of development, as well as small fixes and improvements. <br/></p>\n<p>This project is inspired by the amazing work of <strong>Sebastian Lague</strong> on procedurally generated planets. I hope that this prototype can be of inspiration for other developers as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:33:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d640157c3b3e2445cb96798fee49d5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cgabbi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
