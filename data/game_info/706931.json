You play as an astronaut who, on the way back to Earth from a solo mission, got caught in an asteroid field and crashed their spaceship. The astronaut crash landed on a nearby planet, along with broken pieces of the ship. They are now lost in space with a broken, but still salvageable ship. The only way for the astronaut to get home is to collect all of the missing scraps and repair the ship, or they will be lost in space forever. However, the astronaut is not alone on these planets, and they will encounter a variety of alien species. There\u2019s no way to communicate with them, so they assume the astronaut poses a threat. With limited health, the astronaut has to be smart about his decisions and find the pieces to the ship as safely as possible to return home.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Navigate worlds with a custom gravity system that will leave you wondering which way is up</li><li>Use your jetpack to fly between planets in space</li><li>Fight a variety of alien types with your trusty laser blaster</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Created by\u00a0Mansur Ischanov, Ryan Koichi Lee,\u00a0Ashley Mayer, John Vogel,\u00a0John Yee</p>\n<p><em>Scripts</em></p>\n<p>Custom gravity scripts: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/movement/custom-gravity/</p>\n<p>FixedInterpolation scripts (very helpful article): https://www.kinematicsoup.com/news/2016/8/9/rrypp5tkubynjwxhxjzd42s3o034o8</p>\n<p>Projectiles: https://www.studica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-projectile-in-unity</p>\n<p>Main menu: https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-a-main-menu-in-Unity/</p>\n<p>Shield effect:</p>\n\n<p>Movement acceleration: https://adrianb.io/2015/02/14/bunnyhop.html<br/></p>\n<p>Pause Manager: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/pause-manager-167753</p>\n<p><em>Models</em></p>\n<p>LAR Scifi Blaster: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-sci-fi/751107</p>\n<p>Stylized Astronaut: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/sci-fi/stylized-as...</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>SFX</em></p>\n<p>Air hiss: https://freesound.org/people/typeoo/sounds/521506/</p>\n<p>Air hiss loop: https://freesound.org/people/typeoo/sounds/521505/</p>\n<p>Player hurt sound: https://freesound.org/people/tonsil5/sounds/416839/</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Particle effects</em></p>\n<p>Simple FX - Cartoon Particles: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/simple-fx-cartoon-particles-...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T18:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9e5a70712063138735b323097f88e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["johnyee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
