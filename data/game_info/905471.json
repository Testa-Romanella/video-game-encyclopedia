You chop down trees with your left mouse button, then lumbercrack the trunk down into logs with your right mouse button. Then, you carry your logs back to your lumbershack for points! You'll get more points for bringing in more logs at a time, but be careful! Your walk speed\u00a0is reduced slightly with every log you pick up, and if you aren't careful you might find yourself lumbering (HA!) back to your lumbershack at a snail's pace.</p>\n<p>Also featured is a modern minimalist\u00a0interpretation of the legendary lost hit single 'Lumberjack' by Avinaash. Please enjoy.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the uOttawa Game Dev Club's very first game jam! Woohoo!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T12:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b83/b839a0c1e668b7837f0df8fd1630c9ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maxy3702"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
