Took everything. The only thing John had left to remember her by was a head of lettuce in the fridge. John bonded with the lettuce immediately. He glued eyes on it. Even let it sleep in his bed. Then one day, a gang of malicious snails came and beat John up and ate his precious lettuce. It was time for John Stick to get revenge!</p>\n<p>This is just a proof of concept. You will have to find and  walk over the switches. There is no sound or graphical feedback of any sort, but trust me, it did something.
