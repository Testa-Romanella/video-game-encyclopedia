Tumble is a proof of concept for a longer 3d platformer that would focus on a fantasy creature (an \"owl bunny\", hence Tumble's ability to fly) who has fallen out of their nest and must face their fear of learning to fly in order to make it home.</p>\n<p>as a Game Jam game, Tumble is absolutely *not* bug free, but is in a winnable state</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Mereana Johnston, programming, sound and game design\r\n</li><li>Isaac Bennet, programming, art and game design\r\n</li><li>Sarah Latta, Level design and Asset sourcing</li></ul>\n<p><strong>ASSETS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>All assets in Tumble were sourced from the Unity Assets Store, freesound.org and in some cases created internally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T16:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c4055eea800384018cc95a8d7264d4ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balancing Monkey Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
