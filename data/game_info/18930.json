You need to add in a certain number of cells so that, after a few steps, the field will be halted (in colored mode) or even cleared (in \"hard\" black &amp; white mode).  You could draw in single points, or use standard 'Life' patterns like \"Gliders\" (they move at an angle) and \"Lightweight spaceships (LWSS)\" (they move in a straight line).<br/> <br/>Depending on the difficulty level, the player can use a smaller area to add new cells.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T07:16:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ea/6eaf81a0325259f861fc4c15c46fda35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.22, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 345, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sometimes You"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sometimes You"], "esrb_rating": null}
