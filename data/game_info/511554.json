The area in the mounds have been used as a storage area for the school supplies and equipment. It houses various things from kids\u2019 toys, tools and utilities. However, this school has been abandoned for some time and is rather dilapidated. Few remnants remain to reveal that this place was once a school environment. From the outside, the place looks like any ordinary run-down structure.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Little information has been revealed as to why the school was abandoned in the first place. Many people have come to their own conclusions, but they seem to have little to no hard evidence to their claims. It was mostly speculation and theories.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29b/29b6529ecfaffd07bb0cf069644fa0bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["virtualenvironments"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
