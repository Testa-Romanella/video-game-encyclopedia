In every level, the rules themselves are present as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db6e81062fea652a4cfcd2e43165753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hempuli"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
