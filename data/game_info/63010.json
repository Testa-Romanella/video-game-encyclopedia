Holidays are just around the corner! And our hero is waiting for them so much. But everything is not as simple as it seems... <br/>Somebody has made a decision on no presents this year, but obviously you can't agree with it! Reach the \"villain\"'s lair and make things right. <br/><br/><strong>Mad Frost</strong> is a platformer with the elements of a puzzle. <br/>A sketched story is waiting for you! Each object including the main character is sketched on squared paper, taken a photo of and made alive with the help of Unity. Hundreds of paper sheets, dozens of writing and sketching materials. Everything is for you to enjoy the game. <br/>The story is not so long as it may be desired, but it is to be continued as soon as possible. All funds from the project will go to create the next one!<br/><br/>At the moment the game is optimized for only one resolution of 1366x768 (it is advisable to run in this resolution) to avoid any mistake and misunderstanding we are working on other resolutions (up to 1920x1080)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d804d64d61f0dd70a1ec2eae193d783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EyesbergGame"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EyesbergGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
