Press the button to the bottom right of the web player.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In <strong>Marv's Open Mic</strong>, you're so nervous you've forgotten the song lyrics you wrote! But there's no turning back from this brutal crowd ... You'll need to look around the room and make some <em>connections </em>between possible objects in the room and things you could sing about.</p>\n<p>If you're stuck, check the bottom of the description for some hints! <br/></p>\n<p>Programming by<strong> Greg Greystone, A.K.A eGregious Games</strong>.

For Greg and Popuri it was their first ever games jam! <br/></p>\n<p>Stuck finding objects? Here's the <strong>spoilerific walkthrough</strong>:</p>\n<p>There are five objects you'll need to click for the first five stanzas, in any order (the lyrics will depend upon the order you click the objects!)</p>\n<p>The objects are, from left to right: the picture (second from the left), blue coat, flowers on the table, Blue Eye poster on the coffee counter, and the coffee machine behind the counter.</p>\n<p>There are two final objects you'll need to click in any order in order to finish the song: the curtains at the back of the room, and the clock on the right wall.</p>\n<p>If you spend too much tme waiting before starting the song and/or stumble through your lines, the crowd will turn on you. Marv's clientele are the most brutal of coffee drinkers; a cappuccino and targeted bullying is their idea of a chill sunday. But if you can get through the song without making too many mistakes, these spicy customers might just give you a clap or two.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T17:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2d/f2df0ac986774f062963db713a16c432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eGregiousGames", "pohpu", "SometimesSkeptic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
