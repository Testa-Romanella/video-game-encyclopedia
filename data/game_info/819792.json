With the Minotaur dead, this labyrinth will instead be used to house anyone who dares mention the name Theseus. You, unfortunately, had named your dog\u00a0 Theseus, and are arrested and thrown inside when a guard overheard you calling for him. As you come to grips with your surroundings, you notice something strange - a giant die sitting in the passage next to you, along with strange markings on the floor. Perhaps Daedalus has left a way out, if you're clever enough to solve his puzzle?</p>\n<p><strong>NOT WORKING?<br/></strong>Try the\u00a0<strong>direct link here</strong>\u00a0if the embedded game isn't working for you,\u00a0and make sure you are on the latest Chrome or Firefox version.
