The entire game takes place on the simulated desktop of the protagonist's computer. Assuming the role of an MI7 agent, the player must use their skill and cunning to gather evidence by hacking suspects' computers and phones. </p><p>As an MI7 operative your primary objective is to ensure the perpetrator's arrest and that the courts have sufficient evidence to hand out the longest custodial sentences possible. However, you'll also have to make judgements on whether the case your working on is complete. Move in too quickly and you may miss leads linking your case to much higher profile cyber-criminals. Act too slowly and your suspect may uncover you and escape. In excess of 500 known criminals are known to operate within your jurisdiction, who will you arrest?</p><p><strong>Mainlining is \"coming soon\" to Steam, be sure to visit the game's Steam store page</strong></p><p><strong>Make sure you head off and join the Mainlining community hub  on Steam too for all the latest updates and chat with other fans of the game.</strong></p><p><strong>Mainlining is developed by new indie studio Rebelephant be sure to give their site a visit and if you want to follow designer and coder, Sam Read, on twitter.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aea/aea335d8c6cef157b70291d678940665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rebelephant"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
