Lets reach our quarterly targets, even if we have to break a few eggs along the way!<br/><br/>The karmic cycle on overdrive. Cupids have been automated away, and storks deliver babies day and night, but someone's got to make sure fresh souls are being safely fed in to the gaping maw of modern Civilization. The state of said civilization isn't really any of your business, and neither is workplace safety, so lets get some overtime and generate some more of that sweet, sweet karma.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Click on fresh souls(eggs) to imbue them with hope and\u00a0\u00a0other paltry uplifting feelings. But not <em>too </em>much! Time it so the pesky birds don't damage the merchandise too badly, as that'll reflect badly on how much good they'll bring to the world. But a few dings here and there never hurt anyone, so long as you maximize karmic profits! Break a few too many eggs(souls) along the way too quickly, and don't be surprised if your Earth parallel goes up in flames and the Higher ups start breathing down your neck again though.<br/><br/>Submission for Bolt Jam #9 : Keep it Goin'<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>_Art_</strong></p>\n<p>Bird Eggs Vintage Art by Adolphe Milot under CC0 Public Domain<br/>https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=290098</p>\n<p>Tree Swallow by John James Audubon under Public Domain<br/>https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/white-bellied-swallow/</p>\n<p>Gardens at Alton Towers by Edward Adveno Brooke under Public Domain<br/>https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/alton-towers/</p>\n<p>Table Slipped from Hands by Horace Castelli under Public Domain<br/>https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/table-slipped/</p>\n<p>Conversation by Horace Castelli under Public Domain<br/>https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/conversation/</p>\n<p>Spirit Doth Dwell by Peter Paul Duggan under Public Domain<br/>https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/heaven-spirit/</p>\n<p>Baby Bird Cradle Delivering Grave by OpenClipart-Vectors / 27407 under Pixabay License<br/>https://pixabay.com/vectors/baby-bird-cradle-delivering-grave-2023225/</p>\n<p>The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons, 16 October 1834 by Joseph Mallord William Turner under CC0 1.0<br/>https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1942.647</p>\n<p><strong><br/>_Fonts_</strong></p>\n<p>Black Chancery by Doug Miles under Public Domain<br/>https://www.dafont.com/black-chancery.font</p>\n<p><strong><br/>_Music_</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Egg Crack12 by Reitanna under CC0 1.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Reitanna/sounds/244728/</p>\n<p>TEC Bird Chirps and Phrases by tec_studio under CC-BY 3.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/tec_studio/sounds/362426/</p>\n<p>Short Choir by Breviceps under CC0 1.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Breviceps/sounds/444491/</p>\n<p>Boing by itsallhappening under Sampling Plus 1.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/itsallhappening/sounds/48939/</p>\n<p>Boing by davidou under CC0 1.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/davidou/sounds/88451/</p>\n<p>31arrow shot by gezortenplotz under CC-BY 3.0<br/>https://freesound.org/people/gezortenplotz/sounds/20131/</p>\n<p>VGMA Challenge - July 12th [Audio Loop] [Free Download] by Abstraction under CC BY 3.0<br/>https://soundcloud.com/abstraction/vgma-challenge-july-12th-audio-loop-free-down...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T02:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cb/0cb5df3a9a5023e985cfb34080a36e34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
