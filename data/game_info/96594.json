Watch the fish swim with some beautiful background scenery and calm music. Heck use this as a virtual fish tank, or even fall asleep to the smooth calm musical track. You could\u00a0 also launch this game and use it as a nice visual game screensaver to watch fish swim.<br/></p>\n<p>Additional Info:</p>\n<p>Made with Unity:<br/></p>\n<p>This is an Aquarium Simulator I made after watching a youtube tutorial. There are 3 Aquarium Scenes with different scenery.\u00a0 Hopefully a webgl release will be made as well as well as more different fish. Enjoy what is implemented so far, and thanks for giving it a try.<br/></p>\n<p>More updates about this game and other speed levels can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/Wadester2017/?ref=bookmarks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/69512f0f786fcbfe0714dd36ba20c4a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WadesterProductions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
