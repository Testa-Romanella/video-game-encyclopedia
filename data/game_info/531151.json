Over the course of many weeks, our team managed to distill\u00a0<em>Camino</em>\u00a0into its current form. A hack-and-slash massacre of colonizers, while cathartic, didn\u2019t feel accurate to our own experiences. An endless runner horror game, while potentially compelling, would have an endlessly hopeless narrative that would just amplify real life stressors. Ultimately, a stealth game -- where the struggle for survival is equal parts defiant and vigilant -- made the most sense. As a mostly-Latina and entirely POC team, we drew upon our own experiences to inform the narrative themes, but most central to the authenticity of the story was the work of our artist and narrative designer, Marisa. Marisa, of Afrocuban heritage, regularly consulted with her father for elements of the story and accurate representation of the Orishas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>Team Bruja Bros. is composed of five veteran Gameheads students who are passionate about games and the design process.\u00a0The team is made up of our artist and narrative designer Marisa, artist Camila, programmer Rebecca, level designer Brittany, and our project manager and game designer Bae.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d9e21de44652dfa0adebb139599906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameheads"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
