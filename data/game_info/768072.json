But in spite of all the effort Charlie puts to cheer her up, the dog doesn't want to play. Overwhelmed by <strong>anger</strong>, Charlie is suddenly absorbed by a strange vortex and wakes up in a <strong>strange world</strong>, threatened by a raging volcano.<h3>Beautiful hand-drawn graphics</h3><br/>We took great care in giving Asfalia a <strong>unique visual style</strong>, with wonderful places to explore and lovable, quirky characters inspired by all time classics like Alice in Wonderland and the Little Prince.<h3>Fully voiced by professional actors</h3><br/>We cut no corners in finding the perfect cast of <strong>professional voice actors</strong> to bring life to the characters. Anyone can enjoy the story, even those who can't read.<h3>Simple Point &amp; click gameplay</h3><br/>The game is designed to be <strong>playable by a 5 year old</strong>. Intuitive mouse controls, no cumbersome inventory management, no silly item combinations. When you interact with something, you either have the right item or you don't. As simple as that.<h3>You'll never get stuck</h3><br/>Asfalia is all about telling a beautiful story, not about solving mind-bending puzzles. The puzzles are there to keep things interesting though, so we can't guarantee there won't be some head scratching at times.<h3>Grow your stickers collection</h3><br/>Interact with the environment to unlock stickers and add them to your collection. You'll get most of them naturally as you progress through the story, but some of them will require extensive exploration.<h3>Unlock fun mini-games</h3><br/>Each chapter in Asfalia contains two unlockable mini-games that you can re-play at any time.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T03:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69ff4310e76a190859927a463612f403.jpg", "website": "http://www.asfaliagame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Funtomata"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Funtomata"], "esrb_rating": null}
