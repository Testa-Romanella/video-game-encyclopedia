Oh no... its going down!<br/>Lucky! Captain Holetooth manages to hop off the ship in time and plunges into a lake.</p>\n<p>Now he is adventuring all alone through an unknown land. He must recover his precious candy and get back into his castle.</p>\r\nGameplay / Who is it for?\r\n<p>This game is my first game ever.<br/>I want to make it small and manageable. I'm going to make the art, code and music myself.<br/>I'm 40 years old and worked for Nintendo a loooong time, so I'm pretty familiar with gameplay elements and have raked in serious amounts of gaming time in my life =)<br/><br/><strong>The game is about</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Getting to know the characters in Captain Holetooths world to set up the story and involvement</li><li>Finding the hidden secrets hidden in the levels</li><li>Collecting items</li><li>Creating a relaxing, but also exciting and mysterious atmosphere</li><li>Replay value and exploration</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Scale</strong></p>\n<p>The game is pretty small and can be completed in about 30 minutes. I'm a single developer, so I'd rather finish something small than give up on a too big game. I'm planning sequels anyway... Holetooth's world is pretty fascinating :)<br/><br/><strong>These are the planned levels for now:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Level1: Mystical Forest with underground labyrinth (with some weird inhabitants.. i can tell you...)</li><li>Level2: Top of a snowy mountain (Big things always happen on top of mountains!)</li><li>Level3: The journey back to his castle in Captain Holetooths ship (Side scrolling)</li><li>Level4: Happy End in the castle :) Meet even more characters...</li></ol>\n<p>So then, I hope you follow my game for a bit and stay tuned for some news.<br/>If you are interested in helping me that's fine too. The game will be free of charge and open source.<br/>The Github repository is here: Captain Holetooth on Github</p>\n<p>Kind regards and thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>Oliver<br/>Founder of Hirnbix</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66e/66ee8625d84da5c68f14dfa8eedd736d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["hirnbix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
