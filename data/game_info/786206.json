You have 90 secondes to catch and eat as many bugs as possible, before the rain ends !</p>\n<p>Playable as a lone frog, or as a 2-frogs competition !</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Player 1.\u00a0Jump : W, Z or Space.\u00a0Tongue : X</p>\n<p>Player 2. Jump : J, U or I.\u00a0Tongue : M, K or ,</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The graphics are 2-bit, and sprites are 8*8 pixels, to recreate a\u00a0<em>game-boy</em> style game. Every game uses a different color palette, found on\u00a0Lospec.\u00a0The name and maker of the current palette can be found on the bottom left of the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was made for the\u00a0Mini Jam 106.\u00a0The theme was <em>Frogs</em>, and the limitation was\u00a0<em>Limited time</em>. I incorporated the limitation in two ways : first each game is in exactly 90 seconds, after which it ends, the player must then be as effective as possible in this amount of time. The second is the jumping mecanic : the jump target is constantly moving, thus the player has\u00a0a\u00a0<em>limited time</em>\u00a0window to jump towards the direction they want to go to !</p>\n<p>The game was made on Unity.\u00a0The sprites were drawn on Aseprite, using Lospec color palettes.\u00a0The sounds were built made on Reaper using the Soundly library, and integrated through FMOD into Unity.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20b/20bc55c45b75432797280d6ad40dfc1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Victor Fanton"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
