You will explore an ancient monastery and its dungeons. On the way you'll meet crowds of monsters and giant bosses. As always, your faithful companions - a machine gun, shotgun and grenade launcher will help you drive on! Hundreds of years ago the Holy Order of Friars built a monastery above a portal that connects our world with hell. They vowed to pray every day to restrain the forces of darkness, to keep them from escaping to the outside. For many years you were the leader of the Order, and when you became an old man, you fell asleep and went quietly to the Lord, leaving the holy craft your brothers. However, after a couple of years the monks betrayed their oath. They made a pact with Satan for worldly pleasures and enjoyments. Now their prayer is directed to the call of the son of Satan \u2013 Zeksus, and they themselves are turned into hideous creatures. Sacred power brings you back, so you can get things in order! Almighty has bestowed upon you again youth and strength! And this time, the weapons! Lots of weapons!</p>\n\n<p>Youtube Video Gameplay\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27e/27edfd1c629705838379df3078127411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ngs-Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
