Moss covered stones, wet with the mist of babbling brooks, line the creeks and rivers that run like veins through the upthrust mountains and rolling hills. Or so it was before... in the days when Mit and Manava were still just distant warring factions. Way out in the Frontier, no one ever expected they would be a threat to anyone but each other. The Twin Kingdoms had fought for 1,000 years... until the day the sky was wounded.<br/><br/>Their reckless magic could not stop the sun, but the moon and stars were lost behind a scattered strata of bruised clouds. Reliable navigation ceased, crops withered to dust, and the world plunged into despair. It was then that the Twin Kingdoms came together in a joint effort to preserve the status quo, harnessing the fading power of magic into Mana Machines collectively known as Thaumatechnology. With that power they waged war to bring the world under one rule, for the good of all. But those who had settled the Frontier found their freedom replaced with nothing but service to a greater power. For three long years, they dared to fight for their freedom.<br/><br/>...they failed.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>A disgraced soldier and his magically gifted sister must confront the shadow of their estranged father to survive in a world where technology feeds on the death of magic.
