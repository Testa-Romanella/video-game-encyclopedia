Executables are also available. <br/></p>\n<p>A simple arcade-stealth game inspired by PSX-era games.</p>\n<p>You are trapped in a chamber with a machine. Your goal - avoid detection and collect samples for the scientists. Once your task is done, you need to wail until the teleporter charges up. But be careful! The more you do, the more cautious about your presence <em>the Sentinel</em> is. And you don't want to be hit by its lasers.</p>\n<p>The game consists of a single level. If the WebGL version runs badly or acts up, there's a Windows and Linux version available for download.<br/></p>\n<p>The suggested themes for the jam were <strong>espionage</strong> and <strong>bees</strong>. The execution here of the first one is quite straightforward - avoid detection. The bees serves as an inspiration for the aesthetic and for the concept of the hive. (Did you know a sample solid figure that can be used to create a 3D honeycomb structure is called truncated octahedron? I didn't know that before the jam.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WSAD - move and turn<br/>QE - strafe</p>\n<p>Also should work with a controller.</p>\n<p><em>Quick TO-DO list:<br/></em></p>\n<ul><li><em>add the game jam logo,</em></li><li><em>add sounds.</em></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d45beffdfb4e6b12c089ac25e38597df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["swefnox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
