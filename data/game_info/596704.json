You have to watch out for 4 housemates and 1 outsider. The 1 outsider is your stalker grandma that comes through the window.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Characters:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Goco </strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>Asleep</strong>, has an alarm at <strong>3 AM, 3:30 AM, and 4 AM</strong>, and is <strong>passive </strong>until waken up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Chris/Doctor </strong>:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Is with you in the room <strong>sleeping</strong>, and\u00a0is <strong>passive </strong>until waken up by prolonged\u00a0<strong>lights</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Angy </strong>:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Is in the<strong> question mark area (?) </strong>on the map at the beginning, and always <strong>active</strong>.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Adry\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Is in the <strong>question mark area (?)</strong> on the map at the beginning, and always <strong>active</strong>.</em><br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Granny</strong> :</p>\n<p><em>Is constantly getting closer to your <strong>window </strong>and is<strong> active only while it is open</strong>.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tutorial:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Make it through all 5 nights to win the game. If your window is closed, the oxygen meter at the top left will start to descend. You need to open the window to replenish your oxygene before Chris wakes up. If your window is open, you are also open to the dangers of Granny. Granny is constantly getting closer when the windows are open, which you can hear by her words or her knocking. She usually comes faster if you are distracted, or watching\u00a0 the cameras. If she appears at the window, just close it. That will make her bored. Just don't forget to open it afterwards. If you are watching the window, Angy, Adry and Goco (if awake) are more tempted to jump you. So give equal attention to everyone. Goco has 3 alarms in the morning at 3\u00a0AM, 3:30 AM and 4 AM. Remember to turn them off before she awakens. If somebody is at the hallway ready to jump you, immediately turn on the lights. And you have to act fast because if you turn on the lights too late, you will get jumped. Also watch out for the duration of the lights being on, as it will eventually wake up chris if left on.</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Look around </strong>-\u00a0Mouse.</p>\n<p><strong>Open/Close Window </strong>- <em>Click on the window.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Turn the lights on/off </strong>- <em>Click on the lightswitch next to the door.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the cameras </strong>- <em>Click on the computer.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Switch camera </strong>- <em>Click on any room box at the bottom right map</em>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Close cameras</strong> - <em>Swipe mouse to the right.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Turn off Goco's Alarm</strong> - <em>Switch to Goco room's camera and click on turn off alarm box.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39c971ae071850b728bfc6270cc53d31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["r3unite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
