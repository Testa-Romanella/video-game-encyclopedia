Gotten merrily lost in the graphical programming puzzles of <em>SpaceChem</em>? Love the \"can I manage to build this...?\" creativity of <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crescent Loom is the very first biologically-realistic nervous system simulation game. It lets you \u2014 in a hands-on, mad-scientist way \u2014 get an intuitive sense of how neurons actually work.</p>\r\n[ More Info | Online Demo ]\r\n\n<p>Crescent Loom is currently in <strong>open development</strong>; expect potentially major bugs, crashes, changes, and additions as I work on it over the next few years.
