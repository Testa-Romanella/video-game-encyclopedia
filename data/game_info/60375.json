The player, to progress through the game, must always use, one by one, all the objects in the inventory on all the different objects and characters within the game (and if possible, several times). In addition, only websites in Serbo-Croatian language will be willing to publish a text walkthrough (which must first be encrypted using the SHA-512 algorithm).<br />\nThe author of the video game \u201cLancelot\u2019s Hangover\u201d will also break any contacts with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un by 23th June 2026 and will provide a urine sample, every Tuesday morning, at The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) until January 1st 2027.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-30T13:47:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a867f87866b7b798a361b662935285.jpg", "website": "http://www.lancelotshangover.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 479, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jean-Baptiste de Clerfayt"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jean-Baptiste de Clerfayt"], "esrb_rating": null}
