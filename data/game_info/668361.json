The dragon Pineapple is a fictional character that is supposed to teach 4th grade elementary school children in Germany about the subject area of Roman numerals in mathematics.</p>\n<p>The application integrates VR-typical features and was developed for Oculus Quest with Unity. The goal of the learning application is to correctly arrange the cubes with Roman numerals on the shelf to unlock a pineapple and wooden planks. The pineapple is to be brought to the dragon Pineapple on the last island.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Known bugs: missing final animation, low FPS near the cubes (temporarily used resource-intensive UI canvas due to missing Roman cubes as Assets), insufficient shadows due to problems with baking lightmaps with URP, some incorrect asset arrangement, because of sporadic displacements in\u00a0Unity.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a154ca8072ba8e1b509c9dfe814b77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["inq39"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
