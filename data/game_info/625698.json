In a typical anagram the letters can be re-arranged to form new words (\"ma\" and \"am\" for example) but in Anagraphs, the \"m\" character can be rotated to form a 'w' which allows for the word \"aw\" to be included.<br/><br/>Built with a specially designed font with several characters that can be rotated in such a way, Anagraphs is a challenging linguistic puzzle where you must optimize paths to earn stars used to unlock new levels. Anagraphs is a spiritual successor to the popular word game, Synonymy.<br/><br/>Anagraphs is free, with open source on GitHub. It was developed\u00a0by Cinq-Mars Media, an educational non-profit with projects and games featured at E3, PAX and festivals worldwide.<h3>Discord</h3><br/>Join our server: https://discord.gg/h5GMXQBAUc", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-04T03:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/0558311d059741afef2933536dbc95e3.jpg", "website": "https://www.cinqmarsmedia.com/anagraphs/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Christopher Cinq-Mars Jarvis"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cinq-Mars Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
