Help them to get out of there. You need to use both characters special abilities (blue can pick up crates, pink one can double jump) to successfully help them. There are only 4 levels, and the first 2 are just an introduction to the game. But there's a chance that more levels will come up in the future.</p>\n<p>This is my second game for a jam. Hope you guys enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Attribution\u00a0info:</p>\n<p>Characters: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/free-2d-mega-pack-177430</p>\n<p>Tileset: https://moonempire.itch.io/free-pixel-art-platformer-tileset</p>\n<p>Additional\u00a0Image: https://shouhan.itch.io/simple-assetpack</p>\n<p>Music: https://opengameart.org/content/crystal-cave-song18 , https://pixelsphere.org\u00a0/\u00a0The Cynic Project</p>\n<p>Sound effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/free-2d-mega-pack-177430</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2b8e5b7e5d0f007f2a732b99309c78c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["chelomm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
