Sometimes you have to stop and really think what you are about to do. Because just like in real life, after you place your rake on the sand, there is no undo, you can only start over.<br/><br/>It goes without saying, that in order to get immersed in this gorgeous scenery, you need suitable soundtrack. That is why graphics and handcrafted levels go hand-in-hand with music composed specifically to set your mind at ease.<br/><br/><strong>Have a good time</strong> and <strong>Thank You</strong> for your support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c4f44c106a99c94bfab4d69f62bc8c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["300 fps"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["300 fps"], "esrb_rating": null}
