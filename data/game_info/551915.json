It is my first ever entry for a game jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suggested theme was, 'Less is More'. This is an endless runner game where you have to eat in limits while dodging obstacles\u00a0to survive and run from a dog. Basically it is eat less junk food, stay more healthy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>-Press up to jump</p>\n<p>-In air, Press down to jump down</p>\n<p>-If you hit the obstacle from the front, you will shift back</p>\n<p>-When in air,\u00a0If you jump down on obstacle it will crush it, but it takes energy.</p>\n<p>Hope the instructions are clear and you enjoy the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every single element\u00a0in this game is made by me when the game jam went live, from poor graphics to poor audio.
