There are basically multiple proximity triggers and timers, which trigger once the player collides with them. </p><p>The subject matter was also very appealing since Gui is an international student, therefore his input on the project was paramount to capturing that 'homesick' feeling. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c06/c06217c73ce7c3c0eff5f843d37dd279.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zack Bower-Hamilton"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
