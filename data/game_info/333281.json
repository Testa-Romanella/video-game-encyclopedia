{"id": 333281, "slug": "drowned-god", "name": "Drowned God", "name_original": "Drowned God", "description": "<p>Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a 1996 science fiction adventure game developed by Epic Multimedia Group and published by Inscape. The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history is a lie and that the human race&#39;s development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth through the course of the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.</p>\n<p>Drowned God is based on a forged manuscript written by Harry Horse in 1983, purported to have been written by 19th-century poet Richard Henry Horne, who shares Horse&#39;s birth name. After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing Myst and The 7th Guest in the mid-1990s, whereupon he decided a first-person adventure game would be the best way to tell the manuscript&#39;s story.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-14T02:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/032f7adc87ad2663c59c9b22c0e3fb43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greyenscape"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["SzymCo Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
