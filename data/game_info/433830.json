His crew wasn't aware of this, however, as they were brewing something more malign behind the scenes - a mutiny to overtake their negligent Captain. And, as they started to go through with their plan, Kia was discovered by the rest of the crew!<br/><br/>Keep the mermaid alive in this top down shoot-em-up throughout three scenarios, each more intense than the last, as you play as the Captain shooting with his trusty crossbow anyone who dares come close to Kia! Can you reign victorious amongst your crew, or will they get her before you do?<br/></p>\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n<p>This, technically, counts as a post-jam version. It suffered a couple bugfixes that'd otherwise render a few of the levels unplayable, sorry about the hassle!
