Maybe the computer can unlock the door?</p><p><strong>Note: This is the Ludum Dare 37 original version. I have made minor updates for loading the movie files (game did not work for a while) and had to update the basement textures because of lighting issues in the new version of Unity.</strong></p><p><strong>I might find the tima after Ludum Dare 38 to pick this up again, there is a new Videoplayer component introduced, so I might be able to use that. I have got some positive feedback which I can incorporate in the game. And there are several bugs left in this version which I want to address.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df7/df74c06a13ba7a0d3d7d6ac0a48d4028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unpolishedgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
