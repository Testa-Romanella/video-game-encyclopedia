Occasionally, power-ups will appear that you can collect when the ball hits it, in addition to \"events\", small challenges designed throw you off by partially obstructing the view, summoning decoy balls and strobe lights.</p>\n<p>As each stage passes, the ball gradually moves faster and the animations in the background become more elaborate. Will you be able to prevent the jet from crashing and maintain your confidence?</p>\r\ncredits.\r\n<p> <strong>IceyPie<br/></strong>director, lead programmer,\u00a0 lead designer, composer</p>\n<p><strong>Pokeizel<br/></strong>programmer, consultant, guest composer</p>\n<p><strong>playtesting<br/></strong>IceyPie, Pokeizel, kyle20044, KiwiBurd, MylesD, CatNapYarn, Thomas Lobb</p>\n<p><strong>special thanks</strong><br/>Pokeizel, kyle20044, Scam Man, Alex23, CybbrGhost, TheMaskedChris<br/></p>\r\nphotosensitivity warning.\r\n<p>Pongspin contains flashing lights and patterns that appear frequently during gameplay.
