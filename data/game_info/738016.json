Suddenly, as she explores her forest home, she runs into the gruesome sight of mutilated corpses overlooked by a very tall, dark figure speaking her name. Amea wakes from this vision in a mysterious house as a grown woman who remembers nothing about herself other than what she has just seen.</p>\n<p>In this house, she meets a man named Garrik who is suffering from the same amnesiac condition and who apprises her of what little he knows of the mysterious and deadly town they&#39;re currently in. Garrik goes out to explore rather abruptly; almost as soon as he is gone, a zombie starts attacking Amea inside the house. Grabbing a nearby sword and dispatching the creature, Amea goes out to search for answers to her forgotten past and the situation she now finds herself in.</p>\n<p>Amea is an Action-Adventure flash game made by Godlimations with horror elements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-03T23:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b55e48b4ecd08145127c62fa4508af4.jpg", "website": "https://armorgames.com/play/10487/amea", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
