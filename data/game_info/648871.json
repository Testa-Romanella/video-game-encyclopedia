The planets Have gravitational forces which pull you and your\u00a0bullets towards their centres, the larger the planet, the larger the pull radius. Your spaceship also has a limited amount of fuel available, in order to move around in space, you consume fuel, which thrusts your spacecraft in any desired direction on the 2D plane. To maintain your fuel level, you need to destroy enemy spaceships which provide fuel when destroyed. However, this is not as easy as it sounds as if your spaceship is hit 3 time then the game will end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T09:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cdaf9818aa1abbc35a1eaefe917db11e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["40397680"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
