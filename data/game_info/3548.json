Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn\u2019t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Players get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent&#39;s sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2014-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-26T12:26:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f4e96a5db76ae039b88eefc1370a1b.jpg", "website": "http://www.nidhogggame.com", "rating": 4.02, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 1590, "beaten": 215, "toplay": 21, "dropped": 133, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 357, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 361, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Messhof"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Messhof"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
