While standing still press X to attack.</p>\n<p>Player movement increases their die roll, allowing them to defeat stronger foes until the die hits it's max and resets back to 1.</p>\n<p>Every time an enemy hits you, your Dice Roll decreases. If you take a hit at 1, you'll take one heart of damage. Lose all your hearts and you'll have to start the room\u00a0over again!</p>\n<p>2+ Goblins; they're weak but everywhere.</p>\n<p>2+ Ghosts; they can't hurt you, but they stop you from moving.
