They're back. and they're here to rock various platforms with a new banger, Gasteroids (Goat Asteroids). fueled by dariacore, the need to feel the light of creation, and dentist administered procaine, Carrion Goat has knocked it out of the park once again. enjoy Gasteroids at God's Favorite Angel's Resolution, 800x600, preferably on a CRT or any display technology thats outdated. Carrion Goat and their Benefactors\u00a0have seen fit to bless us with an \"Easter Egg\" of sorts. click around the corners of the screen while avoiding the gasteroids and you may have some Light shed upon you.
