Lovecraft from 1928. It reflects our interpretation of a scene from the story where a police force stumbles upon cultists in a swamp. This is not meant to be a direct re-creation of the scene, but it is rather meant to convey the atmosphere.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p>A grim diorama. Walk among cultists. Steer clear of the dark or listen as your heartbeat speeds up. Undertake a sacrifice.</p>\n<p><strong>REPOSITORY LINK</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://bitbucket.org/btkgamedesign/cthulhu_walking_sim/src/master/</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS - THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>Husam Aldin Al Aloulou (Art)<br/>- husamaldin.alaloulou@ue-germany.de<br/>Jean Isserstedt (Animation &amp;\u00a0Art &amp; Level Design)<br/>- jean.isserstedt@ue-germany.de<br/>Ayan Sanyal (Animation &amp;\u00a0Art)<br/>- ayan.sanyal@ue-germany.de<br/>Naomi Seeling (Code &amp; Story)<br/>- naomi.seeling@ue-germany.de</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS - UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES EUROPE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was created at the\u00a0Game Design // UE\u00a0Department of the\u00a0University of Applied Sciences Europe.<br/><br/>Supervised by:\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai<br/>\"These Boots Are Made For Walking\"\u00a0 (SummerSemester 2018)</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All Rights Reserved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/881df169beb5153d8e775264293fa987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["naomi", "ayan.sanyal"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
