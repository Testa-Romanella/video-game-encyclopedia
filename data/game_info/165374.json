Your blood is your ammo though, so guns blazing might not be the best tactic. <br/> <br/>Follow the guiding arrow at your feet to find the next injured civilian and reach them before they die. Stand next to them to donate the blood they need to survive, but make sure you leave enough for yourself. <br/> <br/>Red cell count a little low?
