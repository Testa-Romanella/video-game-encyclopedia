It was released for the Genesis/Mega Drive in North America and Europe in November 1993, and was ported to the Game Gear and Master System in December 1993 and June 1994, respectively. The plot revolves around Sonic the Hedgehog series antagonist Doctor Robotnik kidnapping residents from Beanville and turning them into robots, with the purpose of removing all joy from the planet Mobius.<br />\nDr. Robotnik&#39;s Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized version of Puyo Puyo and replaces its characters with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay but criticising the difficulty.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-09T02:32:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebf5b8a9f73bbb677b61269d6ecc2f45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 13, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["SEGA Master System", "Nintendo 3DS", "Genesis", "PC", "Wii", "Game Gear", "GameCube"], "developers": ["Sonic Team", "Compile"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
