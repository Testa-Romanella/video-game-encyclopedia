In front of him/her is the home board where he/she should bear off while the side across is the starting point. This means the opponents starting point is exactly on the opposite side. The objective is to remove all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent does. When a player leaves a checker single, the opponent has the option to make a blot, plus leave the checker temporarily out of game. Once the player has moved all his fifteen checkers into his/her home board, might commence \u201cbearing off\u201d.</p>\n<p>Hints: If during a game a player has not been able to bear off neither of his checkers, the other player scores a gammon, a double victory, which counts twice a normal win (doubling).</p>\n<p>Backgammon Arena offers 6 live Game Modes (different rooms and themes) according to your progress.
