The strange blooms harvested in its depths carry many queer properties and the petals are exported to lands near and far.</em></p>\n<p><em>All of that ends today.</em></p>\n<p><em>You awaken to a nightmare. The townsfolk have been absorbed by the great, gnarled tree in the village center. You were spared this gruesome fate - but perhaps something even worse awaits you.</em></p>\n<p><em>Descend into the floral mine shaft, face your fear and confront the very thing you've been trying to forget for so long.<br/></em></p>\n<p>Oblivion Flowers is a gloomy, atmospheric platformer that was made during the Summer Dev Jam. With limited time, we decided that, for this game, we wanted to put a focus on bringing to life a strange and evocative world that feels storied in spite of telling little. We invite you to play it and share with us your thoughts on what you saw in the floral mine shaft!<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Walk - A, D</li><li>Jump - Space</li><li>Dash - Shift</li><li>Attack - Left Mouse Click</li><li>Exit Game -\u00a0Hold down alt and F4</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The following human beings are responsible for this game:</p>\n<p>Vilandas Morrissey (Programming)<br/>Julie Thies (Art, Music)<br/>Kevin Fayard (Design)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:44:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83fced56bd9dec11cf1eec0defcdadf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tamatsu", "Ashgan", "StoneColD002"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
