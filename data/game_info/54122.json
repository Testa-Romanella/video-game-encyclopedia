It is the first in the \"Age of Enlightenment\" trilogy, shifting the series from the hack and slash, dungeon crawl gameplay of its \"Age of Darkness\" predecessors towards an ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. Ultima IV has a much larger game world than its predecessors, with an over world map sixteen times the size of Ultima III and puzzle-filled dungeon rooms to explore. Ultima IV further improves the franchise with dialog improvements, new means of travel and exploration, and world interactivity.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC. Designer Richard Garriott considers this game to be among his favorites from the Ultima series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-29T19:21:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/7730495e8fc0fe7e1e747cb9449399ac.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 2.21, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 248, "owned": 1813, "beaten": 15, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 30, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 159, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 21, "reviews_count": 159, "platforms": ["iOS", "Atari ST", "SEGA Master System", "Classic Macintosh", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Commodore / Amiga", "NES", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Origin Systems", "Elite Systems"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "SEGA", "Origin Systems", "Pony Canyon", "Elite Systems", "Fujisankei Communications International"], "esrb_rating": null}
