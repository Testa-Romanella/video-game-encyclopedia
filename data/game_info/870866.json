This</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 saves time and money! Unfortunately, since it was based on an old game console, there</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is a weird glitch where, if an entire row of material is lined up, it will mysteriously</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 vanish (like Tetris!)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This damages the goods, but it does allow more efficient packing and lower costs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...so maybe it's not a glitch after all, but a feature!?</p>\n<p>also, the worm accidentally Tetris'd everyone's eardrums, so there's no audio :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T12:18:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172fbea30718ce6b294566f838b7f4b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
