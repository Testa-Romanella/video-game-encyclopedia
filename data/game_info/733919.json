Choose two character classes to face off against the Gemini, a pair of fearsome enemies, the exact nature of which is a mystery because this game has no art. Each available class has a specific breakdown along 3 dichotomous axes: Physique / Spirit, Power / Finesse, and Aggression / Caution. Combat stats are derived from these dichotomies. For example:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Attack = Physique + Power + Aggression</li><li>Defense = Physique + Finesse + Caution.</li></ul>\n<p>A shift one way or another along a dichotomy will increase some combat stats and decrease others. Each class has unique trade-offs from its positions along those 3 axes. See the screenshot of the character select screen for a full stat breakdown.</p>\n<p>This was a one-person project made over the course of 4 days, so there aren't many bells and whistles. Or... any bells and whistles at all, really. Think of it as a proof-of-concept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:37:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d708614edfe03a1b75e65cb12b6613.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tangled Web Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
