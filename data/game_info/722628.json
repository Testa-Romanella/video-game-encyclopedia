Protect your hut from goblins, businessmen and other invaders by hurling potions at them, because face it, as a BOG WITCH the last thing you want in your bog is anyone else. So grab your ingredients, mix them up, and get chucking so you can get back to sitting in front of the fire, drinking tea, and cackling. <br/><br/>If you feel particularly friendly though, feel free to invite another BOG WITCH to hurl potions with you in local co-op multiplayer. <br/><br/><br/>Now GET OUT ME BOG!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T02:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee036820cd34e5e047b0e7375c530ed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkeletonTruck"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Skeletontruck"], "esrb_rating": null}
