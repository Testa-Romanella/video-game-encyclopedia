The game is based on theme :\u00a0 \"+1\".<br/></p>\n<p>The game will not be updated and this is the final build.</p>\n<p>It lacks animations, particle effects and music. I made it as simple as i can to learn the basics of game development.</p>\n<p>The game has faulty ending, as in the process of making the game,\u00a0\u00a0i wrote codes all over the place. This happened because of following different tutors and doing stuff on my own.<br/>The overall experience was satisfying, seeing a game of my own and having it on a jam is wonderful.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions and feedback are welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T03:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/289b5a7eb3c25674b09de88c751d8b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JayPnchl"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
