{"id": 670515, "slug": "inner-peace", "name": "Inner Peace", "name_original": "Inner Peace", "description": "<p>Here's a fun challenge - breathe in and out with the monk while playing so you, too, can achieve inner peace and the end of all your suffering (probably).<br/></p>\n\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n<p>Battle evil spirits as you try to meditate your way to enlightenment, channeling your inner energy into meteorological events and violence! Face off against hordes of ch\u014dchin-obake (lantern spirits) and kechibi (ghostly fireballs) to find your inner zen, and watch as their parts litter the ground while you meditate undisturbed. But be warned; should your focused thinking be disrupted, you may never find true tranquility.</p>\n\r\nMY THOUGHTS:\r\n<p>It was pretty fun making this game, even if I didn't get as much done as I'd have liked. I was going for that calming 5-minute game experience, but may have made it a bit too easy and repetitive. If I had more time I'd add a better scoring system, more enemies, more fun in general, but I'm pleased with what I achieved in the time I had - particularly with the art. It's been good for me as well, since I haven't really made any games in the last few months, so this was a great excuse to get back into doing that! And hopefully you have as much fun playing it as I had making it!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and why not post your high scores too? I'd love to see how well everyone did, and if anyone beat my high score - I'll tell you if you did! Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T07:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7e6011a5e5092c468c0f219df9e173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
