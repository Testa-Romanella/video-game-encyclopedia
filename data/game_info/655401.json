Unlike other games I produced, I added music to Swerve; I created a scoring system so it makes Swerve more competitive. When you see the video, you see special particle effects were implemented and I used the basic concepts, tools, and functions that I needed to build and design Swerve.<br/><br/>Making various games will give me a strong background to make even more awesome games in the future and I can grab more knowledge of features behind game development.</p>\n<p>Instructions:\u00a0Click with the left mouse</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b2/6b2f4d3fc71d4bf2413badcc8a5636d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
