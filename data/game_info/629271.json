My intent on this project was to try my hand at each part of game creation (design, programming, art, sound, UI etc) in order to understand how much work it is to tie everything together and discover where my strengths are.\u00a0 It's clear how badly this game needs AI, a clearer repair item appearance mechanic and a settings menu but I've spent too long on this project and must move on. I'll tackle AI in the next one!</p>\n<p>BattlePaddles was an idea I had in high school in the early 2000's but I was overwhelmed by programming and quit my game design aspirations. I regretted it ever since. It feels good to go back and finish what I started, this time with C# and Unity instead of the  OOT Turing language and ms paint.</p>\n<p> I'm anxious to move forward and continue where I left off in my gamedev aspirations.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p><em>-Snowdrift Games</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T11:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/311a0c40fc885b6f6aea54ba02f96fd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnowdriftGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
