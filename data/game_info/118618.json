As the player you control a ship and are able to fish. The goal is to catch all the fish that correspond to the different star signs.</p>\n<p>My personal goal with this was to push my art style, trying out creating a simple fishing game, and just relaxing while creating a game.</p>\n\n<p>Everything in the game is created by me, except for the ambient ocean noise found here:\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1936-Crisp-Ocean-Waves.html</p>\n<p>Only known issue is that you can walk away from the ship. This provides no advantage and only makes visuals strange.</p><p>Game made in Unity.<br/>Art made in Photoshop.<br/>Music made in MuseScore + looped in Reaper.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3cffbf89117937d15c155fe9d893bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miko Sramek"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
