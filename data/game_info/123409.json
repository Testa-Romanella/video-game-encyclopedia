The layout of the room changes to reflect this disconnect from reality too (in the form of the shadowy objects) and the \"shadow ghosts\" are suppose to represent that feeling of people judging you that you may feel when you get too anxious.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Andres Mrad (Q-ro) : Game design, Game concept, Story.</p>\n<p>Catia Carvalho: Sounds, Interface design, Video, game design.</p>\n<p>Diana Gomes: Art and Animations.</p>\n<p>Pedro Almeida: Programming and unity stuff<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cad25cc0b6a84cc47652855c414097f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Q-ro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
