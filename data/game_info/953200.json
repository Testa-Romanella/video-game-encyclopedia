In my several English classes, some of the only ones I could remember (and the ones that stuck with me) were Ray Bradbury\u2019s dystopian works: There Will Come Soft Rains, The Veldt, A Sound of Thunder, and All Summer in a Day. My goal with adapting There Will Come Soft Rains into a video game format was to tell the story in a way that was more accessible, easier to understand, and able to reach a broader audience than the original work may have.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T13:18:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fca/fcaf148d101ad79ebe5906992f057260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PCC_NorthView"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
