It's up to you The Un-Stable Ranger to set those poor horses free. You need to go to as many stables as you can and Un-Stable all the horses. But of course the evil cowboys aren't going to make it easy for you. They captured those horses and they aren't keen on seeing all their hard work run away. They will do anything to stop you from un-stabling the horses. Make sure you don't let them catch you with their lassos. Oh, and watch out for the cactuses. They hurt!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Run around trying to find stables (Big brown boxes on the minimap). Stand in front of a stable door to open it and release the horse. That gives you a point, Woo Hoo! Avoid the other cowboys because they are going to try to lasso you. If they catch you that's minus one life, Oh No! Cactuses hurt if you run into them so don't try it. They also hurt the bad guys though so if you can convince a cowboy to run into one, go for it. Release as many horses as you can before you die. Good Luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD / Arrows to move.</p>\n<p>Drag left mouse to turn the camera.</p><p><strong>Theme</strong><br/></p><p>This game was made for Ludum Dare 49 which had the theme: Unstable.<br/>Stable can be a verb that means to put a horse in a stable, so in this game you do the opposite and un-stable horses.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Music: bensound.com<br/>Stable door opening SFX: freesfx.co.uk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f939c1e56ff31e53cca66b76b23f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DaSpikeyBoss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
