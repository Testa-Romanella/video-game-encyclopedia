Well, the unthinkable happened. The unclaimed glorious, delicious, sumptuous, beautiful sub in the breakroom had still not been eaten when a group of skiing coworkers all ramped off the same cliff... Now they have all returned to the office to retrieve their prize. But the lingering living occupants are confused by the sudden haunting, and wish to be left in peace. This is an online multiplayer game! Get a group of up to 10 friends and play together. If you're a ghost, you must find your unfinished sandwich! Find all the keys to the break room to ascend. Use space to dash and F to hide by possessing objects. Don't get slapped! If you're a human., you must exorcise all the ghosts before they find all the keys by slapping them back to life! Use F to slap. They may be hiding in possessed objects...<br/><br/>Made in Unity with a team of talented people during the 2021 Global Game Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/unfinished-business-0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T05:57:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/563/5639b998be9e3f86168c057f4c83a21c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Austin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
