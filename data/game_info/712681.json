The new revamped version of the Albino Hunter is here to stay!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this Turn-Based RPG, Kalymn Nox returns as the Albino Hunter (as in the hunter with albinism, not some jerk who hunts albinos); even his pretentious and slightly racist title can keep him from waking up broke after a night of drinking. In this exploration-encouraging world, join Kalymn as he finds and takes on various jobs throughout the land which include:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Spontaneous Engagement<br/>\r\n-A Telepathic Lizard<br/>\r\n-A Witch with a Poorly Insulated Castle<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd hey! That was just in the Demo alone! The Full Version will include all sorts of zany antics, such as uniquely written additional plot lines, more Party Members, a fully animated Turn-Based Battle System, ten hours of gameplay, and even an Interdimensional Mini-Game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNew features from the original version include updated and higher resolution graphics, with sixty-eight achievements (over twenty new ones), a more user-friendly interface, a total of three brand new endings, completely rewritten and updated storylines, and many, many more little secrets that you don't want to miss out on! So what are you waiting for! The world of Selendine is just ready for you to explore!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRecommended Age: 14+", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T05:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209d7816ad372fe83dd7d7dfc821365b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CherryCo.Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CherryCo.Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
