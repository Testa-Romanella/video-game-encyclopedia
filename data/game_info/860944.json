Goldsmith Jr. and\u00a0Estle Ray Mann.</p>\n<p>It is an Oscilloscope based game where you attempt to hit a target placed on the screen. This is a simulation of my interpretation of the device on the Fairchild Channel F, and is a type of artillery based game.</p>\n<p>When the game starts up, you can move the target on the screen using the directional buttons and setting it in place by pulling up on the controller. Alternatively you can set a random target location with the 'mode' no. 2 button on the console.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the target is set, you can use up and down to set the delay for ammunition. Setting it to 31 will allow it to return to the ground. Twist clockwise and anti-clockwise to change the angle number (currently between 1-9). Push down to fire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T20:06:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe1cbd36b7ac4e77a27ccb8e585d5c6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikebloke"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
