It was created by 4 students, 2 game design and 2 sound design. We wanted to create a game with \u201cCritical Design\u201d as our primary design approach, with that in mind we created \u201cWildfire\u201d, a game in which you play as a rabbit trying to escape as the forest is engulfed in flames.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The setting, gameplay and audio design are all geared to express a feeling of stress, confusion and perhaps melancholy as you are the small innocent rabbit trying to survive a disaster that is destroying your home, a disaster that you have no control over and that was not your fault. This game is an attempt to start a conversation and provoke thoughts around our role as people around the current climate crisis where our daily decisions impact not just ourselves but every living creature around us.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The project was created in around 1 and a half months. Most sounds were created \u201cfrom scratch\u201d using real life recordings and implemented. The game was created using Unity and sound was implemented using Fmod.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Play using a controller\r\n  </p>\n<p>Movement: Left Joystick\r\n  </p>\n<p>Camera movement: Right Joystick\r\n  </p>\n<p>Timed movement boost: R1\r\n  </p>\n<p>Start/Restart game: Start Button\r\n  </p>\n<p>Exit game (only works in \u201cdeath scene\u201d): Options/Select button\r\n  </p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ahab Ibrahim \u2013 Game Design\r\n  </p>\n<p>Axel Andersson \u2013 Sound Design\r\n  </p>\n<p>David R\u00f6nnqvist \u2013 Sound Design\r\n  </p>\n<p>Xavier Andersson Novela \u2013 Game Design\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T11:37:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29d1663e16bf4bce1adf58f2da1fda03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XavierNO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
