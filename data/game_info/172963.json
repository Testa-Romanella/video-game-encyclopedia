You do not control the tank directly, instead you must give instructions to your crew and assign them to the various functions within. <br/><br/>Getting started:</p><p>Commander: Assign a commander to view the game world outside of the tank.</p><p>Driver: Assign a driver to .. eh, drive the tank</p><p>Loader: Needed to reload the main gun</p><p>Gunner: Needed to rotate and fire the main turret.</p><p>Fix Engines/Turret/Hull: Assign a crew member to fix one of these components</p><p>Ext. Guns: Assign a crew member to sit outside and fire at the enemy.</p><p>Hint: I didn't have enough time to add any proper objectives or levels, so this is just about driving around and shooting things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63a3fd0e013bbdaf825ff2ffa8ad667.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LintfordPickle"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
