You are given levels that have checkpoints and a starting location, you must build a racetrack to allow you to hit all the checkpoints and then return back to the starting line to beat the levels. Once you feel like your track is well built give a shot and get in your vehicle and actually race the track.\u00a0 You beat levels once you get through all the checkpoints and back to the start line.</p>\n<p>Cloud Racer has a Freeplay mode that allows you to create your own level designs, set a time limit on how long it should take to beat, and then you can save the file out and share it with friends and the community. The save system will automatically load in the files so that you can play custom made save files and games.</p>\n<p>This is an early prototype so feedback would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T02:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bfb90c4e9f24838154c07fa0eabce64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zodsmar"], "genres": ["Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
