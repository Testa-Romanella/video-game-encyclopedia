Use one of 5\u00a0special abilities to solve puzzles, and mutate into other types of animals when you need\u00a0the other abilities! Or, at least, that's what it hopefully will be someday. Right now the level after the character creator is mostly just a testing jungle gym. You can play around with using and mutating your animal, and\u00a0find all the neat narration points if you can!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>LoparPanda - Programming, Polymorphic Animal base mesh, blend shapes, procedural animation, and shaders.
