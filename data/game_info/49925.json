You can communicate with the dead using an Ouija board. This way the ghosts will be able to answer your questions. You will also be equipped with a video camera to further document paranormal activity. Every piece of evidence comes with extra points and the scores are then shown on the Global Player Board. The forest, in which the game takes place, is not only haunted by ghosts, it is also inhabited by animals.MORE<br />\nThe player becomes a paranormal activity researcher who roams a presumably haunted forest. During the night the player will fight for more evidence of paranormal presence and\u2026 for his own life. The forest is searched by demons, who may be dangerous once the researcher makes himself seen. The location is full of hidden letters written by those who visited the forest and had lived through the nightmare to tell the tale.FEATURESDifferent types of ghosts roaming the forest<br />\nInteractive, real life Ouija board that answers your own questions<br />\nGreat mix of survival and horror<br />\nGlobal Player Leaderboard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-18T12:58:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8abfd57642dc3d294ef307643f15afb.jpg", "website": "http://fatdoggames.com/game/apparition-en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 31, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["MrCiastku"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
