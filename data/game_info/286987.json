For me, it was fun to think about the action of pulling worms out of the ground and play with the tools, rather than do anything too complicated. The result is a funny little experience in which you play as a giant headed chicken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My goal was to make a game, but this doesn\u2019t have an explicit goal or UI or instructions. Instead I would call it a prototype. The controls are left and right or A and D to move the chicken around, and the mouse to reposition its head and the left mouse to bite down. I initially had plans for a larger sort of story about a chicken whose eating gets too big for its surroundings, but the systems are in place to tell a story like that in the future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c8a1f4df2414c6c0e9122d52811147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["perebite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
