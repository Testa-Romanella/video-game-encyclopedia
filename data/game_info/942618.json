There is a tradition that the lord chooses several people to sacrifice as an offering for the gods to fertilize the land. This year, your family is selected, and they are slaughtered on the altar with people\u2019s cheers. When you are desperate, and about to be killed too, a voice whispers in your ears.</p>\n<p>The voice reveals the truth to you that the lord kills people to use their souls to build an astral world for himself instead of praying for the fertile land. With the power of the astral world, his soul can be immortal. The voice offers you a pact. Your family is just killed, and their souls are not gone yet. It will give you the power to enter the astral world and save your family\u2019s souls. In return, you must help it destroy the Astral world.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, is this the truth of everything?
