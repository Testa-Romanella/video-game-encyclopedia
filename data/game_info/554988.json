The most reliable way of doing so is by picking enemies off one by one, and then parrying bullets into the next enemy you're about to attack so that the combo string keeps going while you make your way over there.<br/></p>\n<p>Seija has taken over the SDM by reversing everyone's magic, rendering them unable to use it. Show her the power of Chinese martial arts and fists, and become the ULTIMATE gatekeeper. <br/></p>\n\n<p>By: Cathulhu Studios, TankTheta.
