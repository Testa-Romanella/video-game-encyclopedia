You roll onto die faces to collect them and win the level when all six faces are attached. The rules are as follows:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>A valid die has opposite faces sum to 7 (1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4) and you may not collect a face if it plus its opposite don't sum to 7.\r\n</li><li>If a face on the die would sum to 7 with a new face, it must be the opposite face.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>So if you try to roll onto a face and these rules aren't satisfied, you're automatically rolled back.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is just a prototype and it doesn't really feel like the game has much more potential than that, but maybe a more talented puzzle designer than myself could do something with this, or maybe it'll provide a nice momentary diversion for puzzle fans.\r\n</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/splinterofchaos/Hard-To-Build-A-Die/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d290c13bcce9e6dc1ec2d0e9300c0c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["splinterofchaos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
