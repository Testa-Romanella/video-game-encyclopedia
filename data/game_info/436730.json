{"id": 436730, "slug": "esquire", "name": "Esquire", "name_original": "Esquire", "description": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Esquire is an endless runner inventory management game, taking inspiration from multiple genres to create a fun, faced paced puzzle game.</p>\n\n<p>Knights make an \u2018abit of getting all the praise and glory, but they\u2019d get nowhere without their trusty attendants. Being a squire is all about tending to your knights every need and making sure they're always ready for a fight. You\u2019re gonna need to manage all the gear they loot; it\u2019ll probably be broken but that don\u2019t make it useless, got it? Keep \u2018em weapons sharp and the grog flowing and you\u2019ll take your knight far. Knighthood is overrated, the squires are the real heroes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How the Game is Played:</strong></p>\n<p>Your aim as the Esquire is to keep your knight healthy and equipped with functioning weapons and armour. The Trouble is knights aren\u2019t known for being delicate. As the equipment breaks down, you\u2019ll need to repair it. Shift items in your bag around using the mouse and match 3 or more same-items in a line, be it weapons, armour or left-over grog. This\u2019ll combine them into something that works, allowing you to re-equip the knight with the \u2018E\u2019 key. You\u2019ll have a steady flow of loot coming your way so as long as they stay alive, you can keep going.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/7520cef010be3868e6a6d71cf55e0fba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spaghetti Man", "OliverMatheGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
