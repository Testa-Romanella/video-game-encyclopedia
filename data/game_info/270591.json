Well, aside from the custom tileset and rich story I want, that is.</p>\n<p>The game has relatively simple controls, but hopefully offers depth to those who want to pull off neat tricks with the combat, which is modeled a bit after 2D Zelda games. The vision for the finished product is a fun, simple game with rich, bite-sized stories and memorable characters, paired with dungeons to explore and monsters to slay.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>- Nathan Amata<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae75a82c4679b3dcb790e5a3b1185035.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nathan Amata"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
