{"id": 974553, "slug": "mothers-and-daughters", "name": "Mothers and Daughters", "name_original": "Mothers and Daughters", "description": "In Mothers and Daughters, you play as Max\u2014an 18-year-old college freshman venturing into adult life. <br/><br/>All the mothers are true MILF's, as in they are all mothers, and they are all love interests in the game. You can chase that hot MILF neighbor, sexy teacher, your best friend's mom, your arch nemesis' mom, or any of the other mothers in the game.<br/><br/><br/>(Pictured Maria and Teri)<br/><br/>Similarly, all the daughters you meet are love interests, and you can chase any of them, from the shy girl, the loud mouth, your old babysitter, your best friend's sister, your arch nemesis' sister, or any of the other daughters who are either the same age or slightly older than Max.<br/><br/><br/>(Pictured Kimberley your best friend's sister, and Patricia your arch nemesis' sister)<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you can choose the name, either staying with Max or customizing it to something else. This is also when you'll set the difficulty of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The difficulty setting doesn\u2019t change the content you see in the game, just your journey. The difficulty choice is designed to give the player a challenge or an easier path through the story. The complexities of pursuing multiple women will be more demanding in Hard mode than in Easy mode.<br/><br/>In Easy mode, characters are more forgiving and have lower thresholds for Affinity and Persona. Where there is a scene selection, you\u2019ll get to play more scenes in Easy mode. For instance, on the second playable day at the mall, you have multiple choices of which girls to interact with. On Easy mode, you can select all the options. On Hard mode, you need to be more selective, as while you get the same choices, you can choose only a certain number.<br/><br/>The Easy mode also allows the enabling of the in-game walkthrough hints. These hints appear under the various choices and show how they will alter the character statistics. These hints are not available in Normal and Hard modes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The difficulty mode also affects some of the apps on the smartphone. With the Easy mode revealing more information than Normal or Hard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are fourteen mothers you can romance in the game. Amanda, Barbara, Cynthia, Jacquelyn, Jennifer, Katia, Lauren, Margaret, Maria, Meghan, Talia, Teri, Victoria, and Zoe.<br/><br/>Each has their own personality, desires, and differing relationships with their daughters.<br/><br/>How you approach their daughters could affect their receptiveness to your charms.<br/><br/>If you love mature women, there is plenty to choose from.<br/><br/><br/>(pictured Maria)<br/><br/>Maria, the hot MILF neighbor with two daughters. Chasing either of her daughters can remind her of what it was like to be young and open opportunities to fulfill her new yearning for intimacy.<br/><br/>Victoria, another MILF neighbor. She lived alone until her daughter recently moved back home. Can you rekindle her desires and show her what she's been missing?<br/><br/>Teri, the MILF owner of the local Cafe and mother of one of your babysitters (Samantha). Teri doesn't like to admit her age and loves the attention of younger men, regardless of what her daughter or anyone else thinks.<br/><br/>And so much more. Each woman has her own desires and passions to fulfill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are fifteen daughters you can romance in the game. They are split up into two categories. The younger daughter includes Alison, Amy, Caprice, Haylee, Josie, Keira, Kirsten, and Natasha. <br/>The older daughters include Catherine, Elena, Karla, Kimberley, Melanie, Patricia, and Samantha.<br/><br/>The younger daughters are the same age as Max and attend the same college. Which classes you pick will determine which girls you will see more of. The girls are venturing into adult life like Max, and each has their own expectations. The girls in this group will be more suspicious of you flirting with their mothers.<br/><br/><br/>(Pictured Caprice)<br/><br/>The older daughters are in the 21-25 age range, with Catherine being the oldest of the group. The girls in this group have already ventured into adult life and have a little more street smarts than their younger counterparts.<br/><br/>They are likely to have more responsibilities and life issues and will generally be less suspicious of your flirting with their mothers.<br/><br/><br/>(Pictured Catherine)<br/><br/>Not all the mother-daughter relationships are revealed straight away. This is designed as a challenge as the characters observe the player and may change their behavior depending on how they see you interacting with other women.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Focus on one love interest and maximize your playtime with her. Aim for all her scenes and explore her needs and desires and delve into her backstory as you aim to seduce your one true love.<br/><br/>Mothers and Daughters allows you to pursue just the one love interest if this is how you prefer to play. You\u2019ll still have scenes with other characters and will play through other story aspects of the game, but you can do so while remaining faithful to your true love.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why settle for one woman when you can have multiple. Chase several love interests simultaneously and explore the desires of many characters as you choose the ones you want to be with.<br/><br/>Mothers and Daughters presents opportunities where you can pursue multiple love interests. Your chosen difficulty setting can make this a real challenge. But be careful who you go after, as women will talk, and you could end up in big trouble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not content with chasing multiple women separately? Then go for the group option. The harem play style is similar to dating various love interests. But instead of keeping each love interest unaware of the other women you are pursuing, the goal is to get those women into a group where they\u2019re happy to share you with other women and even participate in group sessions.<br/><br/>Unlike the multiple women play style, the harem play-through will present options to get a group of women together. Due to the pre-rendered nature of a visual novel, the groupings of women shown for a particular harem will be offered based on community feedback and interests, as well as story needs, as the development continues.<br/><br/>First, you\u2019ll need to pursue women separately to get them interested in you. Then through game events, you introduce them to aspects of group dating and sexual interests. Some women will be keener than others to explore group sexual activities with other women.<br/><br/>You can use this aspect to maintain smaller groups if you prefer, rather than going for one large group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your choices, big and small, add depth to your adventure. Mothers and Daughters offers a dynamic storytelling experience where every decision you make, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has its own ripple effect.<br/><br/>When Catherine removes her heels, do you say she's shorter than you or that you're taller than her? If she doesn't like being called short, she may bring it up in future conversations to poke fun at you in return.<br/><br/>Those smaller choices are designed to make the characters feel alive and more immersive. Also allowing for subtle changes if you replay the game opting for different paths.<br/><br/>Not only that but some subtle choices open other scenes. When you first meet Catherine, and she asks for help moving boxes, you can say she looks sweaty. In response, she'll say she will jump in the shower later. Whilst it may seem inconsequential, it opens the chance of spying on her getting changed later that day.<br/><br/><strong>Note: This is a long play story first game. If you're looking for a quick fap, this isn't going to meet your needs.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T04:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fa/3fa5595ad7a721e4bc60114cd9295e39.jpg", "website": "https://www.spin256.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spin256"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spin256"], "esrb_rating": null}
