It is intended to be\u00a0 a Challenge Tower: the player enters the tower, doors lock behind them, and the only way out is to defeat all the enemies. The enemies come in waves and each floor has three waves. Each third wave is a boss wave and signifies the end of the floor. Currently there are only two floors. This will be updated as new versions are ready to release.</p>\n\n<p>Kinzoku is coded in Lua and made with the Solarus Engine.
