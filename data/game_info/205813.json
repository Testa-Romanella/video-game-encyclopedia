With K.O. kidnapped, Co-Bruh must infiltrate the Boxmore facility. However, having snakes for arms makes for cumbersome stealth missions. Boxmore, being a rather chilly super villain headquarters, is not a suitable environment for snake arms. Before embarking on his mission, Co-Bruh knits a scarf for his high maintenance extremities but only has enough yarn to comfortably cover one! He is forced to swap the scarf in order to keep his arms from starting a fuss and alerting patrol units around the Boxmore facility. In order to trick one arm into letting him remove the scarf, Co-Bruh must charm the pants... er, scarf off of his arm by performing his Snake Trance Yarn Dance super power! Co-Bruh must remain vigilant as he is vulnerable to patrolling units while using his charming super ability.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Press Space bar to skip the title screen</p>\n<p>Sneak to the end of the maze without getting caught by using the arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>If the snake bar reaches the end, the snakes will alert the enemies to your position.
