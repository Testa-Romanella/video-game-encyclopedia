You are in command of four soldiers (broken into two smaller fire teams), and you&#39;re able to issue commands to either team, an individual soldier or all four guys at the same time. Players must manage the placement of their men in the Set-Up mode, then carry our orders in the live Execute mode -- each stage is a critical part of getting the job done and getting every soldier out alive.<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and this item&#39;s use restrictions.
