Most of the fortunes for the game's Tarot readings  were generated by GPT-2 and then edited by me, the author.\u00a0 GPT-2, who might be a distant cousin of iFortuneTeller, is a neural network that writes text by predicting one word at a time. <br/></p>\n<p>The creators of GPT-2 are OpenAI. You can access GPT-2 easily via talktotransformer.com. </p>\r\nAll of the music in this game was lovingly hand-crafted. \r\n<p>Many, many thanks to:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Matthew Slayton for the main musical theme, \"Tarotomaton\"</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Rodolfo Zuniga and Caroline Buse for \"You Are Free\" (win condition music) and the custom fortune themes</li></ul>\r\nHow to download and open:\r\n<p>The easiest way is just to play in your browser.</p>\n<p>If playing on Windows, download the .zip file and extract the contents.
