I added some more inspiration from Snakebird and the strength puzzles from Pokemon, mashed it all together, and came up with this. A game where you roll up snowballs to make snowmen. I know it isn't the setting one would immediately think of with growth, but I wanted to keep the concept of growth front and center and didn't want to limit myself for the setting.\u00a0I hope that helps it stand out a bit more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although I have something here worth putting up for the game jam, I plan on continuing development for some time.\u00a0I worked together with my friend Gabriel Contreras to make this game, overall, I'd say we both contributed about equally to this during the game jam.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Up, down, left, and right to move. That's it. Also there's a reset button at the top left if you ever feel stuck.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Lead Design: Damian Leyva</p>\n<p>Art: Damian Leyva</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Gabriel Contreras</p>\n<p>Music: Kaden Sullivan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44ad9bb1db4666e04ec4736e0e7e55b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LotusHOV", "GabeContra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
