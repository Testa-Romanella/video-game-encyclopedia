(It's also my first game jam :P)</p>\n<p>This game fits the theme (Less Is More) as the more hearts you have the less strength you have making it harder to kill enemies.</p>\n<p>Everything aside from the sound was made from scratch, the music was made using Ecrett and the sound effects were made using bfxr.</p>\n<p>Controls are WASD for movement and E for attack, I used this control scheme as an extra nod to the theme by making the game playable with one hand.</p>\n<p>Finally as a random impulse I added support for switch pro controllers.\u00a0 For the controls use\u00a0 A to attack and continue through the title, B to exit the game in the title screen, and the Left Stick to move around. (Presumably PS4 Controllers should also work, but I don't own one so I couldn't test this)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/459369e3f153bcb156423a652d8cb41a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bloodriddenwolf"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
