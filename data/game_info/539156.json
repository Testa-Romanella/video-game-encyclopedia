Go from a simple blob of gooey cuteness to a biped creature capable of jumping through the obstacles, grab the wooden pieces with your slimy tentacles, break rocks with a gelatinous horn, and much more.</p>\n<p>This game was the first Game Jam experience for most of the team, plus we are all students at the start of a game development course in university.
