The games are written in Twine and the choices in the game are shown in distinct colors. The player weaves with the appropriate colored yarn to control the game, and in doing so weaves their choices into a scarf they are actively making through play. When game play is complete, the woven scarf will be unique to each player\u2019s set of choices and exist as a more permanent record of their play session.    </p>\n<p> The project is open source, and along with all the source files we have included a guide for sourcing the materials and tutorials for putting it together. We also include three Twine games and a tutorial that walks the player through how to weave. Two of the games follow the Greek myths of Medusa and Oedipus</p>\n\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
