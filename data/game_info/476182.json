However the frogs won't let you pass. So you have to break the Fly Cage to distract the frogs. However, breaking the fly cage could also mean blocking your way, because Vines will come down and block your way this time instead of the frogs. Unless.... you have the ability to rewind. Yup! use the rewind ability to solve puzzles and get that sweet Nectar!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T02:45:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba2689770b8ef66d9baf450ba30d182.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarleyKristianto"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
