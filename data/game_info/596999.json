Unfortunately, there's something called a bunch of rocks in the way. \u2639\ufe0f</p>\n<p>To get through these rocks, you have a trusty terrain deformer at your side. Just click with it and it'll start removing terrain. However, this terrain deformer takes power. Fortunately, you have a generator you can unpack and place it wherever you want, and it'll wirelessly start giving power to you.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that wireless power will only reach a certain range away from the generator, so you can't go very far away from the generator without losing power. Fortunately, the generator supplies infinite wires that you can place within the range of the generator to extend the signal.</p>\n<p>However, you can only carry five wires at a time, so you can't just go trigger happy with the wires - you have to keep coming back to the generator for more.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to go deeper and deeper into the ground, with just a jetpack, terrain deformer and a generator? Download the game to do so.</p>\n<p>--Controls--</p>\n<p>Left/Right Arrows: Move left/right, respectively</p>\n<p>Up Arrow: Fire a pulse from your trusty jetpack (infinite fuel)</p>\n<p>E: Place generator, place wire, or restock on wires (depending on context)</p>\n<p>--Changelog--</p>\n<p>1.1:\u00a0 fixed bug where you could get stuck in wires (also linux version)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2bd2dde10093feaae87bcc9cc5b479b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CubeXGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
