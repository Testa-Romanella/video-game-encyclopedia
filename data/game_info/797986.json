We got in touch via Discord then and after hours of chatting in English, it turned out that... we are both Polish! :)<br/></p>\n<p>In terms of the development of the game, the biggest challenge was well-designing the game. Because this time does not count towards the 3-hour limit, planning everything well made us able to come up with a pretty fruitful product.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We had more levels designed, however, because of the time limit, we needed to cut it into only one level. We extended it a bit from what we initially planned, so sorry if the game is too hard!\u00a0<br/><br/>For anyone stuck/willing to make the game easier for themselves, we uploaded the map, available under this link:\u00a0https://imgur.com/a/AOAitzO\u00a0(Spoiler alert!)</p>\n<p>Filip has a lot of experience with making background music, however, it was the first time that he did the sound effects. It was a bit challenging for him, although he nailed it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T04:42:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee16af3d8a9e6bf34ea177a7d0e7a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zbordek", "filipscomposer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
