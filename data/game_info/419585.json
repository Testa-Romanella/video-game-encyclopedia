You and\u00a0your dog, Boomerang, are tasked with returning a stolen gem to the coconut spirits (called TreeTellers) who inhabit this jungle.</p>\n<p>This was a particularly fun game to make because it uses characters and creatures who\u00a0I had first thought of a long time ago.\u00a0It was really satisfying to be able to take my old ideas, and express them in this interactive fictional world.</p>\n<p>As you play, make sure you talk to all the other characters. They will have good advice for you as you make your way throughout the jungle.</p>\n<p>Music: Legend by Adrian von Zeigler (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcUyN66G0IA)</p>\n<p>Other sound effects were from\u00a0www.freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/9105954f0199fec6a2f397fda6e27a24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Josh Finkel"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
