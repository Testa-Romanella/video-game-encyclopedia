Since we indie game devs tend to be exceptionally masochistic, we decided to make our game jam efforts in to a prequel for Sanctuary Island (you can view our Kickstarter here)!! Please keep in mind that this prequel was made in less than thirty days by a team of four. While we are very proud of it, we know there will be bugs to fix and little tweaks here and there. Also, there are key differences between it's choice based structure and that of LM: SI. But differences are what keeps things interesting, right? So, on behalf of the Squid Sins Squad, we present to you the all of Love Mythos: Origins. We will be making announcements on our Facebook and Twitter, so stay tuned for the relaunch of our kickstarter in late 2018!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/517/51708aa689cafc57a26d55aafa15817e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquidSinsSquad"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
