You play as a knight and need to save villagers.\u00a0 Return them to the safe house. The game i kind of turned based, meaning when you move everything else moves in a tile based system. Used arrays for \u00a0placement, also made so the villagers blindly follows your steps. You have the opportunity to teleport in front off the safe house together with the villagers.<br/><br/>I had to script for a while to get things work. I could have easily made a game with click-fusions built in objects but i decided to make it my way.<br/><br/>Sound effects made with Bfxr https://www.bfxr.net/<br/>Game made in Clickteam fusion 2,5<br/>Title song and endgame Jingle made with fruity loops.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T04:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f9/2f9e2ea76087e707306a6a231d6678da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Splattersoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
