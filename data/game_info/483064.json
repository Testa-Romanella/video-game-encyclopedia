But there are glitches that occur during the game. Those glitches shuffle pieces around and even sometimes fuse then.<br/>Of course the glitches aren't random, because the devs are actually bad so they forgot to cover all edge cases, leading to strange behavior triggered by certain configurations of pieces. (that's an intended game mechanic) <br/>Also you will need a friend (or a foe) to play, because the highly incompetent devs couldn't finish the chess bot.</p>\n<p>Installation &amp; Customization:<br/>Unzip and start the .exe / .x86_64<br/>The Game needs some support files, the good news is that makes it customizable.<br/>You can define glitches on your own (by extending glitches.json) <br/>and even change the movement pattern of the pieces with an image editor (by editing the png in the Movement Masks Folder).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db783b3a3b61d756bb9b5bea3b4585c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Shapkofil"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
