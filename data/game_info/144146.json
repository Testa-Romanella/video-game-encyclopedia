The theme was \"On Thin Ice\" and the resulting game ended up being a lot of fun to play, specially when a few of the elements worked together better than expected.<br/><br/>I used a few assets from the marketplace, such as the POLYGON Vikings pack for some of the ice and mountain meshes, and I modeled and rigged all characters. The Killer Whale was a lot of fun to model, rig and animate.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about Seal Downhill is the whale's behavior. The Orcas are there to ruin your run, and they will try to push you down to the bottom of the ocean - however, sometimes they end up helping you by throwing you high in the sky and out of the water, sometimes letting you reach a platform that you didn't expect reaching.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b0dbcd96b6ba98bf8314ce67f024456.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solidmesh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
