{"id": 226035, "slug": "age-of-civilizations-asia", "name": "Age of Civilizations Asia", "name_original": "Age of Civilizations Asia", "description": "Age of Civilizations is a turn-based strategy game in which your object is to dominate the world.<br/><br/>\u2022 Maps:<br/>- Asia | [462 Provinces]<br/><br/>\u2022 Orders are submitted before each round. The number of orders you can submit during each round is limited by your Movement Points for that round.<br/>\u2022 After orders are submitted, civilizations execute actions in turn order, which is randomized at the start of each round.<br/><br/>\u2022 Map<br/>- The capital is the most important province in a civilization. If you lose your capital for 3 turns, your civilization will no longer exist. If you capture another civilization\u2019s capital, you obtain all of its provinces. Capitals have a defensive bonus: +15% and an offensive bonus: +15%. Capitals have all buildings already constructed.<br/>- Transparent provinces are neutral. Provinces with color belong to other civilizations.<br/>- You can scale the map. To go back to the standard scale, double tap the map. If scale is other than standard on minimap you can see '!' in top right.<br/>- Use the Economy and Population buttons to view each province\u2019s Economy and Population values. Use the diplomacy button to view each province\u2019s owner and engage in diplomacy (see Orders- Diplomacy View).<br/><br/>\u2022 Treasury<br/>- Money is added to your treasury through income tax, which is based off your civilization\u2019s total population and economy. Money is subracted from your treasury for military upkeep, which is based off your amount of military units (units at sea have a higher upkeep than units on land).<br/><br/>\u2022 Orders - Normal View<br/>- Move: move units from one province to another. You can move between provinces you control or attack another civilization\u2019s province.<br/>- Recruit: recruit units from the selected province. This costs money and is limited by the population of the province. Recruiting from a province reduces its population.<br/>- Build: construct a building in the selected province (see Building Types). This costs money.<br/>- Disband: remove units from the selected province. This decreases military upkeep.<br/>- Vassal: creates a vassal state with another civilization.<br/>- Annex: brings a vassal state back under your full control.<br/><br/>\u2022 Orders - Diplomacy View<br/>- War: declare war on a civilization.<br/>- Peace: submit a peace offer to a civilization. If accepted, your civilizations will no longer be at war.<br/>- Pact: submit a pact offer to a civilization. If accepted, the civilizations cannot attack each other for five rounds. This can be canceled through a War order one round in advance.<br/>- Alliance: submit an alliance offer to a civilization. If accepted, that civilization will aid you in your military efforts. Use the War order to let allies know who your targets are.<br/>- Kick: end an alliance with a civilization.<br/>- Support: give money to a civilization.<br/><br/>\u2022 Building Types<br/>- Fort: gives a province a defense bonus.<br/>- Watch tower: allows you to see army numbers in neighboring provinces.<br/>- Port: allows units to move into the sea. Units at sea can move back onto any land province, even if it doesn\u2019t have a port.<br/><br/>\u2022 211 Civilizations<br/>\u2022 Vassals<br/>\u2022 Offline and Online achievements<br/>\u2022 Offline and Online Hall of Fame<br/>\u2022 Google Play Game Services leaderboards and achievements!<br/>\u2022 Random placment<br/>\u2022 Random fill<br/>\u2022 Random games<br/><br/>\u2022 Scenarios:<br/>- Modern world<br/>- Modern world Full<br/>- World war I<br/>- World war I Full<br/>- World war II<br/>- World war II Full<br/>- Custom scenarios!<br/><br/>\u2022 Three different types of fog of war:<br/>- Off<br/>- Standard<br/>- Full<br/><br/>\u2022 Tutorial<br/><br/>\u2022 Available languages<br/>- English<br/>- \u010ce\u0161tina<br/>- Espa\u00f1ol<br/>- Deutsch<br/>- Fran\u00e7ais<br/>- Italiano<br/>- \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e<br/>- Nederlands<br/>- Polish<br/>- Portugu\u00eas<br/>- Russian<br/>- \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4<br/>- T\u00fcrk\u00e7e<br/>- \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587<br/>- \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587<br/>- \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629<br/><br/>Special thanks to all translators!<br/><br/>Contact: jakowskidev@gmail.com", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe966af6ba8ef6e8eaa19073282048ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["\u0141ukasz Jakowski"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
