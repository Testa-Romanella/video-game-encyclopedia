Even though we had 10 days to work on this project, I only had around 5 due to complications with my home life during the current crisis. I've decided to release the Trello board I created so people can see the ideas I had for the game if they are curious and maybe in the future I'll create a game similar to this one with all the features I wanted to add.</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks:</strong></p>\n<p>I just want to say a huge thank you to the organisers of the game jam, this current crisis has been a tough time for myself, as well as many others and having the opportunity to work on something that can bring some normalcy to our lives at this time has been a lot of fun and a welcome break.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<p>https://trello.com/b/bDzzzksJ/stay-away-simulator</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:32:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b51b2081ff03f834ae36e1f7f940bdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GaKoPop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
