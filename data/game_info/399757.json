(\u00b4\u25bd\uff40)<br/>I'm Nito Souji, a solo indie from Japan.<br/>This is my first game having real players other than me. Your honest feedbacks are really important to make this game better and complete.<br/>Please feel free to get in touch with me. Your opinions, suggestions, bug reports, all welcomed! ...Find a dumb mistake in my English? Love to hear that! <br/>Also I really suck at marketing, have no budget to work with a PR company. So word of mouth is the only marketing channel for me.<br/>I'm so grateful if you would share this game with your friends and enjoy it together.<br/>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/EternalStew<br/>Discord: https://discord.gg/dS4xBTg<br/>Press Kit: https://pullstay.weebly.com/<br/>Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179890/Pull_Stay/</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a8a8b0de17c86f5585110740197019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 418, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nito Souji"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
