Right when you leave the room, be ready to kill them all!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Arrow keys to move <br/>- Left click to shoot<br/>- F3 to input a cheat code (I don't remember what any of the codes are)<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/>- When shooting, the bullet travels very off-center of towards the reticle. This is due to the reticle sprite not being properly centered.</p>\n\n<p>\u2020 This was the first game I ever made, way back in August of 2009. I was 13 years old. It was made using Game Maker 8.0. I'm uploading the game here for historical purposes and because this game holds a place in my game designer heart. Here is the original Game Maker Community post where I first published the game:<br/>http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=445856&amp;hl=%2Bvirus+%2Bhunter<br/><br/>Please feel free to leave a comment below about the game, or tell me about the first game you ever made and what it means to you. I appreciate all feedback.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this game will not be receiving updates or bugfixes.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:44:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ab/8abac79d6f6dffac407d304fb320791f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HoofedEar"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
