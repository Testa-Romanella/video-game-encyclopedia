Left for dead after a mutiny on a trading ship, you must explore the surrounding environment, encountering resources and other settlements and their parent cities. To survive, prove that you belong in this world. Through trade, you must work your way from a log in the water to a fully crewed galleon. Along the way you see a variety of interesting sights, meet different cultures, and buy exotic goods.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOr just walk around and explore the world with your friends.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is a tech demo for Bound Horizon, what will hopefully become an economic - exploration game, where you sail around the procedurally generated world, finding new markets and seeing exotic cultures. Right now all you can do is swim around an unlimited world.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game will be released for free on sites like newgrounds and kongregate.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHere's some stuff we plan on adding:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Exploration\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>World streaming</li>\n<li>Texture based on biome</li>\n<li>Settlement Creation</li>\n<li>Day/Night cycle</li>\n<li>Vegetation/Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gameplay\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Movement system</li>\n<li>Vehicle system</li>\n<li>Inventory system</li>\n<li>Mild Survival system</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Multiplayer\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Make client movement multiplayer compatible</li>\n<li>Make server code</li>\n<li>Prediction/Interpolation</li>\n<li>Connect to server/server browser</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Trading\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Implementing trading model</li>\n<li>Add items</li>\n<li>Add shops</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Settlement Management\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Develop system </li>\n<li>Develop</li>\n<li>???</li>\n<li>Profit!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tech\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>2D GUI system</li>\n<li>TB Approved options menu</li>\n<li>Save System</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Polish\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Sounds -???</li>\n<li>Optimization -???</li>\n<li>Refine generation -???</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/632/632a3c465231038e6833a001ee121b23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["danman113"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
