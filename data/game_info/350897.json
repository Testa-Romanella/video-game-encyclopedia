You will have to act like a real dino if you want to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHe will have to explore and meet other creatures in different environments, as well as providing them with food to help them survival.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd there's no use in rushing to the end of the level. If he doesn't face a minimum amount of enemies and doesn't gather enough food, he won't proceed to the next level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe wanted to develop a game for the whole family. You will need to memorize the lay of the land to avoid getting lost, and also hone your skills to beat enemies.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f1889649d45101ac16a1952184d6d33e.jpg", "website": "http://www.supernovagamestudio.com/site/projetos/dino-lost", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supernova Game Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Supernova Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
