This was made a year ago in my gamemaker class for an assignment. It can be kinda fun but it is a bit harder than I remember making it. Fun to play after so long!</p>\n<p>All of the art and assets made by me.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click on the three assets at the top left of the screen, these are your defense systems. One is meant for shooting targets, one is meant to slow them down, and one keeps them from moving forward longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click anywhere on the board to place them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To get more credits to buy defense systems, black holes will appear on the screen. Click on them to earn 25 more credits.</p>\n<p>If the enemy hands reach Agent Alpha, you lose.</p>\n<p>Once you lose, you'll have to close and reopen the game to play again. (Sorry, forgot to add a reset and I can't edit the files unless I buy gamemaker again lol.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:20:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70af56763df53f945fd497eeccedcf5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unrealer"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
