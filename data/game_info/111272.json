Every effort has been made to keep the original gameplay style, clunky 80\u2019s style graphics, and amazing level design! Jumpman Forever features:</p><ul>\n<li>32 Levels brand-new old-school inspired levels</li><li>4 Game Modes</li><li>2 Playable Characters</li><li>Mind-bending action puzzles</li><li>And more ways to die than you can shake a stick at</li></ul><p>But we\u2019re not stopping there. Every quarter, we\u2019re releasing another free Jumpman Forever level pack for the next two years! We don\u2019t want to just create a great game and walk away \u2013 we want to create a game that keeps people playing (and hopefully keeps new people buying it!) On top of that, we\u2019ll be releasing the Jumpman Forever Level Editor and sharing community, letting everyone get in on the fun of creating and playing even more awesome levels!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ef/8efc21e447d18c3629fc7e676fb31867.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Midnight Ryder Technologies"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
