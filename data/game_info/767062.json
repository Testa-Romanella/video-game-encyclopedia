A threat that appeared out of nowhere some 200 years ago. After many successful victories over smaller and medium sized nests, the kind has deemed you the perfect fit to try reclaiming Mine 54. An experiment originally meant to test how deep a new prototype driller could reach. The mine that the infestation first appeared in.</p>\n<p>You've been given a state of the art portable reactor as well as a small squadron of engineers and gunmen. You will set up just outside the mine and work your way as deep as you can, clearing nests as you go. While the main infrastructure of the mine may not be completely intact, there are many maintenance corridors and doors you could likely use to gain access to the rest of the facility.</p>\n<p>However, the deeper you go, the angrier the spawn seems to become, an unending wave of furious beasts,\u00a0 each more deadly than the last, you're sure now, that if you were to fall, this nest won't stop at just reclaiming the ground it\u00a0 has lost, you are the only thing standing between you and your countries, no, you species survival.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do not fail.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Select units or structure with left click.</p>\n<p>Drag for square selection.</p>\n<p>Right click to give orders.</p>\n<p>Right click doors to order your units to travel through them.</p>\n<p>Your units will attack the closest enemy to them automatically</p>\n<p>~Note: The control system is quite janky; we had no time to finish bugfixing it~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T21:12:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b963c4421cf4ba05e2ce3006814289cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locke8"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
