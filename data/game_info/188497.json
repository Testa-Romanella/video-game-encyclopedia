They have been used in many other games and it removed some of the face value personally. I didn't want to make the game public as I was concerned with feedback and when I finally did I had great feedback but quite a lot of messages regarding the game as an \"asset flip\". I decided to stop development once I had a playable prototype up and running.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e8/2e80bd468bb513e5dff82ffb6a5f338e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jakes Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
