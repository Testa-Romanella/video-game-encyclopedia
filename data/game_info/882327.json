Not much now but to grab a few guns and some enemies to gun down. The Idea is you have a limited amount of moves to make. If you hit zero, the game ends.\u00a0I will update this game whenever I make major improvements. Long term, I want this game to be a survival roguelike with a light touch of board game mechanics. The map, gameplay and UI will all ultimately be overhauled and, of course, real gameplay will be added.
