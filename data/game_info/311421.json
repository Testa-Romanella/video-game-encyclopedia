It's all up to you to find them using your mathematical genius.\u00a0<br/>The math is easy enough that you won't need a calculator but the puzzles are tricky enough for you to be good with numbers to solve them.\u00a0<br/>Although each puzzle can be eventually solved by trial and error but solving them yourself using your brain is the most satisfying experience.<br/><br/>So bring out your inner mathematician and challenge yourself with these ever-increasing number of puzzles. More and more puzzles shall be added with every update.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-22T04:55:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/457/4576aab671006e76db7c5e1079c95a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["adityangm4"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
