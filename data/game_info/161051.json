You can host a NodeJS server to control connections, then a Game server to show the gameplay, and then any number of Clients to interact with the game. The game in question is a simple two-player collection game of jumping squares. The players compete to collect the squares, and the audience can spawn squares for the players to collect.</p><p>Everything was made in Superpowers HTML5 (which uses Typescript) except for the node code which was done in raw Javascript.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/401dc07f63c68b1e4c27f5ff8ae5dfe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phrawger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
