(Yes, Another Pacman Clone) is a Pacman style game made with GDevelop themed around the quarantine that has taken place in many of our countries due to the current pandemic.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to avoid the C-moles until you pick up a Power Up like washing your hands, using a sanitizer, wearing a mask or staying home... At that point, the C-moles will turn blue for a limited time (shown as a bar on the top right of the screen) and you can hunt them.</p>\n<p>There are also two bonus tokens on each level that can be either Bronze, Silver or Golden. Eating these will also allow you to hunt the C-moles while additionally giving you extra hunting time and extra speed.</p>\n<p>How long will you last in QuarantinE?<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the <strong>Arrow Keys </strong>to move Q-man</li><li>Press <strong>&lt;P&gt;</strong> during play to pause the game and see the options menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T05:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b4/6b49df701cd69b92eec97f78569180c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MeViPortal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
