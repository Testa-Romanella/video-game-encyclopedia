You are a politician giving a public speech where you choose what you say - hip hop style.</p><p><strong>Development:</strong></p><p>The game was originally planned to have 3 play stages - representing local, state, and federal government respectively.</p><p>One full level of the game (local government) has been completed, along with lyrics, level graphics, user interface, and music.</p><p>The vision for the game was to progress through the levels of government, with each rap being themed around that particular level. To progress and unlock the next level you would need to achieve a certain score from the current level, representing your personal popularity.</p><p>Scoring is primarily determined by your accuracy when selecting from a set of 4 word choices, when a word or phrase is missing from the speech, as represented by the question mark placeholder \"???\". To gain popularity you need to say the words that sensibly fit the current sentence. Your choices are rated as \"correct\", \"not so correct\", \"incorrect\", and \"you're a delinquent\". The lowest score is also given for non-selection.</p><p>Additionally, scoring is adjusted based on how \"on the beat\" you are. Successive correct answers on the beat will give you a score multiplier (up to 4x).</p><p><strong>Input: <br/></strong>Number Keys: 1, 2, 3, 4 (select word)<br/>OR Mouse (select word)<br/>Letter Keys: R (restart)</p><p>Gotta give the people a VOICE, yo!</p><p>Thanks to the fine organisers of TasJam, including Eloise Ducky &amp; Jason Imms, and our fine judges Kamina Vincent, Lauren Clinnick and Katie Gall!
