Shoot them to make them go away, but be smart! Just shooting a FACE doesn't give you a lot of points. True mastery of FACEDROP comes through maintaining a healthy population of FACES, because the longer a FACE exists, the more POINTS it generates. However they also grow faster over time and once it's fully grown, a FACE will drop and if a FACE hits you, it's GAME OVER!</p>\n<p>Don't get a GAME OVER!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\nKeyboard:\r\n<p>Arrow keys to move around, D to shoot</p>\n<p>Enter to pause</p>\n\r\nGamepad(360 pad, though any gamepad should work):\r\n<p>Dpad/left stick to move around, A to shoot</p>\n<p>Start to pause</p>\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\n<p>Mute Audio with \"M\"</p>\n<p>Toggle fullscreen with \"F\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be723eabc3b5052f79cadd3389b4c47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MOKKA"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
