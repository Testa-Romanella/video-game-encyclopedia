The rules and movements of pieces are identical to those in conventional chess but with an added twist \u2013 it is mandatory to capture an opponent piece during a move if possible. The winner is the player who gets all their pieces captured first or is unable to move during their turn (i.e. conditions of stalemate).<br/><br/>The average game lasts around 10 minutes and you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly the advantage moves from one player to the other. Be careful \u2013 one false move and the whole game can slip away from you before you even realize it. Remember \u2013 pieces that are useful in conventional chess may not be so in this version and vice versa.<br/><br/>Go ahead and discover the unique strategies of Chicken Chess!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e3a007bf85f8accec3ddba208397bb.jpg", "website": "http://veplapps.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Vaibhav Electronics Pvt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Vaibhav Electronics Pvt"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
