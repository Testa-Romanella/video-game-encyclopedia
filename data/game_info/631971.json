Players can fight against a friend or foe on the same device, or against a computer AI.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main objective of the players should focus on maintaining more bases than their opponent. There is a meter that goes towards one player or the other depending on the ownership of the bases.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe more bases a player has the faster the meter will move towards that player.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T02:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c77012781732fce4bad726c93bddd98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["sc Reea"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["sc Reea"], "esrb_rating": null}
