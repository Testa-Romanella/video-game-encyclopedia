{"id": 135083, "slug": "trap-of-the-alchemy", "name": "Trap of the Alchemy", "name_original": "Trap of the Alchemy", "description": "<p>Our game is a 2D platformer which is characterised by dynamics and constantly changing mechanics to which you have to quickly adapt to. We have named our game \"Trap of the Alchemy\". The reason behind this name is that as a gamer you play a role of red-haired mad scientist with goggles. As always it is all about creation of potion of immortality. Of course you are a mad scientist so it is normal that you don't have any asistents, because of that you test your new made potion on yourself. Instead of effect that you wanted you get hallucinations. This is the time while you start in our mad game. Sooner or later you die, as a alchemist you add something new to your potion of immortality (unlocks system), and you drink it again. Endless game and fun go on.</p>\n<p>Created by:</p>\n<p>Olgierd \"Nordtraveller\" Jaros,</p>\n<p>Kinga Mirkiewicz,</p>\n<p>Piotr Morawski,</p>\n<p>Mateusz Nag\u00f3rka,</p>\n<p>Olga Vasylyshyn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f870e14017a150c31f2dd734458792cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nordtraveller"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
