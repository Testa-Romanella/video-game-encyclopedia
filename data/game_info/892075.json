You can play the original game via archive.org's emulator here.</p>\n<p>The reason I made this port was primarily technical: I wanted to implement a game in 6502 assembly involving hundreds of active objects interacting with each other, and push graphical limits at the same time by augmenting hi-res graphics with a dynamic sprite overlay. Kye was the perfect candidate for this experiment, since it saved me the trouble of having to come up with my own design, and it's a mostly forgotten game with a lot of user-made levels that's definitely worth a bit of fresh attention.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is simple: move around with the green circle thing and collect all the diamonds. It's up to you to discover the rules!</p>\n<p>Controls: joystick in port 2 exclusively. No keyboard input.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Original game: Colin Garbutt</p>\n<p>Level sets:</p>\n<ul><li>Default: Colin Garbutt</li><li>Sampler: Dr Floyd?</li><li>Plus 2: Mark &amp; Dave @ Positive Ltd.</li><li>New Kye: Unkown</li><li>Shapes &amp; Monsters: Dennis K.
