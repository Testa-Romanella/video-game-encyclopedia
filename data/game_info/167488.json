I decided to make a custom small video game as a <strong>birth announcement</strong>.</p><p>The project has been made with Unreal Engine 4, it is very possible that the performances are bad, I'm not an optimisation guy. Also the file is quite big...</p><p>Every assets were made by me, the music is partly generative (so don't hesitate to let it play ^^) and I made the whole game alone.</p><p>Only recent Macs can run the app (need Metal).</p><p>I hope you'll enjoy this tribute to my kid. Don't hesitate to comment!</p><p>I would have loved to keep working on it, but I have to go back to Hyperun !!!</p><p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd64283186cfed643a2e2edbf9d922e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tomavatars"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
