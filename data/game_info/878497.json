After centuries the old wizard awake and try to escape the planet.</p>\n<p>13 levels, 4 bosses. Treasures to collect, and monsters to even avoid, or kill.</p>\n<p>THE GAME:</p>\n<p>This game was made for the theme of \"C64\". I combined two old games from the Commodore 64: Wizard of Wor, and Lady Tut. On the first two levels you have to avoid monsters to get to the next level. After the 2nd level you can collect gems, that serve as ammo, and you have to kill a certain number of monsters, represented by the number next to the beating heart (which represents the monster's ever increasing speed). A key will spawn, then get to the door, and the next level.</p>\n<p>The game can be quite hard at some points, so don't be affraid to use the cheats, that can be activated only on the main screen.</p>\n<p>KEYS TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>At the start screen press any keyboard or gamepad button to fill out the command to load.</p>\n<p>On the Main screen you can activate some cheats: press F1 for Invincibility, F7 for Infinite life and F8 for Infinite ammo.</p>\n<p>In the game press F3-F4 to set sound volume, F5-F6 to set music volume.</p>\n<p>You can use keyboard or gamepad to play.</p>\n<p>KEYBOARD:</p>\n<p>Move: arrow keys or WASD</p>\n<p>Shoot: RSHIFT, RCTRL, G or SPACE (you can shoot only after picking up the first glue gem on level 3)</p>\n<p>GAMEPAD:</p>\n<p>Move: sticks or Dpad</p>\n<p>Shoot: A or X, right trigger or right bumper</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Design, code, gfx: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Eszik (Coyote / Pixel Krajc\u00e1r)</p>\n<p>Additional design: Katalin Redlinger (Allegra)</p>\n<p>Music: Andrea Baroni / Cyberleaf studio (Main screen: Pyramids Pyramids, Story screen: The Boss Battle)</p>\n<p> https://andreabaroni.com/</p>\n<p>GravitySound / GameDev Market (Levels: Book, Level, User, Inspect)</p>\n<p> https://gravitysound.studio/</p>\n<p>RedEarth / GameDev Market (Levels: Awakening, Bosses: Confrontation)</p>\n<p> https://linktr.ee/redearthmusic</p>\n<p>StevenMelin / GameDev Market (Boss Alert: Alert!, Outro: Blasting through the Sky, Defeat: Exploring the Depths)</p>\n<p> https://www.stevenmelin.com/</p>\n<p>Sounds: Game Audio Vision</p>\n<p> https://gameaudiovision.com/</p>\n<p>Rude66 / GameDev Market</p>\n<p> https://rude66.bandcamp.com/</p>\n<p>Andrea Baraoni / Cyberleaf studio</p>\n<p> https://andreabaroni.com/</p>\n\n\n<p>See this, and more on my homepage:\u00a0https://pixelkrajcar.com/</p>\n\n<p>I post something new now and then on facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/pixelkrajcar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T08:43:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e972ccac0b9e973a3a7f73e54c977fae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LtCoyote"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
