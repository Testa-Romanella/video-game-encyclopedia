Screen 1 allows us to</p>\n<p>draw text on the screen as well as sprites, the second parameter indicates to</p>\n<p>use 16x16 sprites magnified. I would normally discourage such setting, but</p>\n<p>given the limitations I wanted the characters to be large.</p>\n<p>The sound for the jump is done using the SOUND command, which works instantly,</p>\n<p>instead of PLAY, which is used for the game over and win tunes. PLAY will freeze</p>\n<p>the computer while reading the tune, and that will kill gameplay. Using SOUND</p>\n<p>for the jump was necessary. The jump sound also uses the envelope function of</p>\n<p>the PSG, which is not used on the other tunes, for that I needed to use a</p>\n<p>different channel for each (tunes on channel 1, jump FX channel 2)</p>\n<p>The game also waits for the music to finish before you can start a new game.</p>\n<p>3 IFNOTSTRIG(0)ORPLAY(0)THEN3</p>\n<p>Of course, I removed all the spaces that were not necessary to allow for more</p>\n<p>characters, and used single numbers for the lines (all that are obvious tricks)</p>\n<p>lines 1 to 3 are initialization, spread to not go over 80 columns</p>\n<p>line 4 is the check for new game (and extra initialization)</p>\n<p>line 5 is the check for the jump action if not already in a jump</p>\n<p>line 6 is the draw of the player and the update of all the variables</p>\n<p>line 7 and 8 are the draw of the obstacles and their update</p>\n<p>line 9 is the check for winnging or return to game loop (line 5)</p>\n<p>line 10 is the sprite collision handler, and display of game over</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T15:01:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381abab7d0dead0d68d22ec9d5b45391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
