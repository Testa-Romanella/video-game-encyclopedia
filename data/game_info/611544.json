The UI system logs the keys as points and the player is notified that the level is completed once all four keys are found and collected.</p>\n<p>I had two main issues when doing the project, one was having difficulty scripting the moving platforms to elevate and carry the character so I instead got creative integrated the upper level of stone platforms onto the lower level and just had it surround the island landscape.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The second issue revolved around attaching the camera to the third-person character after learning the mechanics would do better in third person than in first person. While I parented it, I noticed it causes the character to run more to the left side while running forward. The only way I was able to get around that was to hit the right-arrow key every few seconds as I\u2019m running. This is something I may possibly fix in the future for this game on this site.</p>\n\n<p>Game is a Zipped Windows Build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T09:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f3a0c445766408f26bb6b6c9722f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ds_z1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
