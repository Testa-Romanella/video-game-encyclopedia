Imagine an experience where you have multiple settings, a variety of enemies, and a music selection as large as your personal library.<br/><br/>Now imagine it has a catchy name, with a double pun inserted for good measure, and you get S#arp Shooter! A game for the HTC Vive and Oculus (Rift + Touch) where you are the star of your very own action film, complete with large mob sequences and the soundtrack you listened to while stuck in traffic to help imagine yourself elsewhere. <br/><br/>All weapons fire based on the music itself, and enemy spawns are scaled to match. You can earn headshots and aim to beat your personal high score, or play more casually and just enjoy letting the scene play itself out.<br/><br/>This game is currently in development, and while it has several levels and most of the core functionality already, the following features are planned for the future:<br/><br/><ul><li>Song Leaderboards<br/></li><li>Ability to play music from SoundCloud<br/></li><li>Voice Recognition<br/></li><li>More scenes, enemies, and guns<br/><br/>It\u2019s time to shoot our own new Virtual Realities!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/20548e93f71ba880ab811de657cab5d0.jpg", "website": "http://complex-infinity.com/SharpShooter/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Complex Infinity"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Complex Infinity"], "esrb_rating": null}
