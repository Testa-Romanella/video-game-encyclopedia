After pouring blood, sweat, and tears into his latest plan, he intends to spread the word of his takeover by any means necessary. However, the only flaw in his master scheme is vivid to the eyes of others: Himself. Being an incompetent villain and kindhearted young man, Xeno would be the last person one expects to dawn a long cape and traverse down the opposite road most choose for an adventure.\u00a0However, that's exactly what he does, which is where the comedy involving his surroundings ensues. Accompanied by his cat Timothy, who can now speak due to technological enhancements, Xeno sets forth to advertise his eventual conquest, meeting new faces along the way.</p>\n\r\nXeno\u00a0\r\n<p>Xeno (pronounced ZEE-NO)\u00a0is a youthful individual, who thrives on striking fear into the hearts of others. At least, that's what he thinks he is. In actuality, Xeno is rather terrible as a \"supervillain\", and is quite lacking in the cruelty departments\u00a0as well. With a simple-minded world view and kindhearted nature, Xeno seeks to make the public think otherwise of him for reasons unknown.\u00a0</p>\r\nTimothy\r\n<p>Timothy is Xeno's pet cat. A wise and seasoned feline, Timothy will not hesitate to give Xeno words of advice (not that he'd end up listening, of course).</p>\r\nMysterious Woman\r\n<p>Oooo. She's a secret!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Very</em>\u00a0Short (around 30 minutes if you're checking everything out)</li><li>No Battles!</li><li>Lots of Dialogue</li><li>A Comedic Experience</li></ul>\n<p>(And please let Wearyrains/PIB know if you find any bugs or missing credits!)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for checking out <em>Xeno The Destroyer!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:59:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/445c32965f3cec5d06d9943f6fb650da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelatedInkBottle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
