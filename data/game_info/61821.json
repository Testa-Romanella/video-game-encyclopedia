{"id": 61821, "slug": "kingdoms-of-marazia", "name": "Kingdoms Of Marazia", "name_original": "Kingdoms Of Marazia", "description": "Build up your army in the safety of your own castle.<br/>Your private realm is your refuge, where a wealth of resources and open land await you. Construct a town hall and barracks to begin creating your villagers. Woodcutters, farmers, and miners will be essential in helping you gather enough wood, iron, and food to support your army. Here's a tip: set your woodcutters to auto-cut mode to have them cut down trees without your guidance for a while, letting you focus on more important things... Like building up your military units.<br/><br/>Swordsmen and archers are the backbone of your army. With the barracks, create swordsmen for melee and archers for ranged damage. Builders are able to construct archery towers, which will defend your base even while you're offline, making them a vital part of any well-built base.Then venture out into the world to challenge other players and defend your base.<br/>Your little corner of the world is just the beginning. Once you take your units out of your castle and into the lands beyond, it's time to expand further, protect your castle from invaders, and start conquering lands of your own.Choose to work together...<br/>Resources are limited, and having powerful allies is one way to ensure the safety of your base and gain access to more resources for you and your friends. In-game chat lets players collaborate and strategize in real time, allowing for intense multiplayer battles. The strongest alliances will find themselves at an advantage when it comes to claiming mine entrances, keeping weaker players away from underground tunnels and the rich iron stores found inside.Or destroy everyone in your path.<br/>Not a team player? Lay waste to other players' bases with your superior military might. Destroy their castles to force them to start again, letting you claim more land for yourself. Portals connect multiple maps within the game, letting you expand your territory even further, leaving destruction in your wake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/207832c954e8cfb7322fd289f87038d9.jpg", "website": "https://www.firedragonstudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fire Dragon Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fire Dragon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
