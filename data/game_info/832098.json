{"id": 832098, "slug": "its-high-noon-itch", "name": "It's High Noon (itch)", "name_original": "It's High Noon (itch)", "description": "It's High Noon\r\n<p>This is my PICO-8 remake of Ocean Soft's Highnoon, originally made for the C64\u00a0by\u00a0Andrew Spencer and\u00a0Steve Wiggins.</p>\n<p>There are a lot more bullets on screen in my version and the gameplay is much faster. Also there are no abducted saloon girls\u00a0in my game since they are all pretty much\u00a0capable of defending themselves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play: Waves\r\n<p>Use the D-pad or arrow keys to move around.<br/></p>\n<p>Shoot by tapping or holding the primary button or x.</p>\n<p>Hold down the secondary button or c to keep firing in the same direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play: Duels\r\n<p>Wait for the games title plate to vanish and the\u00a0\"Draw!\"\u00a0text to appear on screen and shoot quickly using the primary or secondary button. Shoot too early and you will lose a life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nHints\r\n<p>Shoot outlaws early during the levels\u00a0to get a higher bonus at the end of a wave\u00a0in duels.</p>\n<p>Keep moving around since outlaws will always shoot in your general direction.</p>\n<p>You can exit the screen to the left and right to reappear on the opposite side. Use this to your advantage to avoid bullets.</p>\n<p>From wave three onwards outlaws will throw dynamite sticks at you.\u00a0Shoot the\u00a0dynamite to kill outlaws.</p>\n<p>Horses (wave 4 onwards) can't kill you but the riders might.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Bountydex\r\n<p>In duels you will fight a variety of outlaws with\u00a0randomly generated names and titles. There are ten special titles that can be collected in your Bountydex by shooting them in duels. Since it is a chance of like 1000:1 to meet one\u00a0of these titles exactly\u00a0there are two ways of unlocking these\u00a0titles.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at the second item, the <strong>Blind Barber</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now let's say you meet a <strong>Furious Barber</strong> in a duel\u00a0and you shoot them. Justice in the Wild West was just a word and since you shot\u00a0a barber, the item will be crossed off your Bountydex with <strong>one stroke</strong> even if it was not a <em>blind</em> barber. After all how many wanted barbers can there be?</p>\n<p>Now let's say you got really lucky and you meet the <strong>Blind Barber</strong> against all the odds. You shoot them and their title will be crossed off the Bountydex with <strong>two strokes</strong>. It might be not possible to meet the exact titles for the\u00a0entire Bountydex but you are welcome to try.</p>\n<p>And yes:\u00a0many innocent barbers were shot in the Wild West.</p>\n<p>To access the Bountydex press down on the title screen. Press up to get back to the title.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nBonus game:\u00a0High-Low\r\n<p>There is also a hidden bonus game of dice. To access it, press right on the title screen.</p>\n<p>You can bet on how you think the numbers of the next roll of dice turn out\u00a0compared to the displayed pair of dice: higher or lower. Bet your money accordingly to raise your high score.</p>\n<p>By the way:\u00a0The more entries you got collected in your\u00a0Bountydex the more money you start out with.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0actually researched dice games of the old west and it appears that back in the days\u00a0people really played this game besides poker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nWhere can I play it\r\n<p>Right here on Itch. I will add it to Pico-8's Splore laters as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T08:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/30429b1f914a1bb5ff609210bfef372d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Donswelt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
