No?? Well now you can, in TERMINAL VELOCITY.</p>\n<p>Use A and D or an Xbox One controller's left stick to steer left and right.</p>\n<p>Your velocity is constantly ascending beyond your control! Grabbing boosts (red orbs) will increase your acceleration, while slamming into tombstones will slow you down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The higher your speed, the larger your combo multiplier becomes, so find the right balance between blistering fast and slow enough to control! If your speed goes beyond capacity, you'll blow up and it's game over!</p>\n<p>GMTK Jam 2020 entry by:</p>\n<ul><li>Allison Langlois</li><li>Chey Amil</li><li>Daud Nazary</li><li>Karan Tawde</li><li>Matthew Murchison</li><li>Nicklas Steffensen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T04:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/109/10958b7a91c8ca57e972c0b97d27f3bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Murch", "CheyDev", "NSteffensen"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
