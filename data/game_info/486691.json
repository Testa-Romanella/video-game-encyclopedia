It's simple, but I had doubts, and proved to myself that I could make it happen in an interesting way.\u00a0I got most of what I wanted to done, but the shop system (the other primary use of the Spirit\u00a0Orbs) wasn't quite ready, as well as many other infrastructural elements that I just had 90% done and couldn't manage to finish for the jam. Still, the randomization mixed with the few pre-made rooms that I made and show me that I was super right about the potential of this idea, and I may pursue the game a bit further to polish and tighten it up how I envisioned it.\u00a0</p><p>EDIT FROM A MINUTE LATER:</p>\n<p>ARE YOU KIDDING ME I SPENT SEVEN MINUTES WRITING THIS WHEN I ONLY HAD FOUR TO SUBMIT TO MIZIZIZIZ'S JAM WHAT.
