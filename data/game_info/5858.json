If you survive for 2 minutes, you are doing really well.<br/><br/>The creator of Slydris, 2012 iOS Game of the Year*, is back with another elegant and intense puzzle game designed specifically for touch screens.  CRUSH sounds simple: Keep the blocks from filling the screen by removing matching colors with a single touch.  But the blocks keep coming, and each touch boosts the stack even higher.  CRUSH brings you three modes of exciting short-burst puzzle gameplay:<br/><br/>THINK mode: Take a little time and consider what moves to make.  Go for massive combos to rack up the best Block score.<br/><br/>REACT mode: Make moves quickly to keep stack low.  Survive as long as possible.<br/><br/>CRUSH mode: The ultimate combination of speed and strategy.  Go for both large combos and a long survival time.<br/><br/>Choose from 6 recharging powers to use as you please, with each slightly changing the strategy required to achieve maximum scores.  The powers also provide a shield against an untimely death, but are destroyed in the process.<br/><br/>CRUSH also lets you select from 3 background color schemes to suit your needs.<br/><br/>CRUSH includes an innovative 4-way UI system and a minimalist art-style inspired by Propellerhead Software (Figure, Reason, Rebirth).<br/><br/>(*Gametrailers.com)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:54:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a95/a95895948cd6070176610258af3f75be.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Radiangames"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Luke Schneider"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
