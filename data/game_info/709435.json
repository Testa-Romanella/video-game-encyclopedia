Two explorers find their way into the illusive temple, finding themselves trapped in a dynamic, yet parallel path towards their own fates.<br/>Who exactly is Somnus? Why is the temple cursed? What is the secret behind the mysterious artifacts? And how does this tale all tie into the future of our humanity?</p>\n<p><em>Animus Toil</em> is an experimental puzzle-adventure game, featuring two playable characters and randomized room sequences, giving each player different experiences. While each puzzle can be solved on their own, it is encouraged for players to exchange solutions and reach the game's end together.<br/>Each playthrough has an estimated completion time of 1-2 hours, and there are 4 possible endings to discover.<br/></p>\n<em>\"Proceed with curiosity.\"</em>\r\nLaunching 12.22.21<p>In order to fully realize the creator's vision, this experience contains intense and disturbing scenes, including those with various visual effects that may be dangerous to anyone with photosensitive epilepsy.<br/></p>\n<p>Download the PC port for FREE! This native Windows version is the original Game Boy ROM running on GB Studio's built-in emulator and exported to an executable. This version allows for easy windows/screen-resizing, as well as plug-and-play support for controllers (such as the newer Xbox controllers, which have been tested and working).<br/><br/>If you donate $1 or more, you will gain access to the Game Boy ROM itself, allowing you to experience the game natively through hardware or emulation.<br/><em>Animus Toil</em> has been tested and working on most  Game Boy emulators, although please be mindful when saving is implemented. VisualBoyAdvance is recommended. For the most authentic experience, as the creator intended, play on Game Boy Color hardware using a burned cartridge (requires battery for saving) or flashcart of your choice with stereo headphones.<br/>Also included is the official soundtrack, which has been enhanced and exported to both FLAC and MP3 formats.<br/></p>\n<p>However you choose to play <em>Animus Toil</em>, please feel free to leave as much feedback as you wish. All critiques are welcomed, as they will help improve future projects.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Story, graphics, gameplay, and music all created by Hunter Gerace.</li><li>Developed using GB Studio engine by Chris Maltby.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:58:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af8/af8c464878cf69889f5b2c9803f9bf4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindset Makers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
