The theme was \"You Only Get One\", so we made a 2D platformer with dynamic lighting and a darkness mechanic where you can only see a level once by using a single match. Probably the \"cleanest\" and most solid Ludum Dare team entry we've done.</p>\n<p><strong>Awards (out of 780 jam entries):</strong></p>\n<ul><li>#2 in Overall</li><li>#2 in Audio</li><li>#4 in Fun</li><li>#8 in Theme</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Current world records:<br/></strong>Normal Mode - 3:23:34 by DDRKirby(ISQ) (video)<br/>Hard Mode - 4:36:32 by DDRKirby(ISQ)<br/>Also see a\u00a0former Hard Mode record video\u00a0- 5:14:46 by DDRKirby(ISQ)\r\n</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare submission page</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05ccaf627517d6def34c9c0eb668e62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DDRKirby(ISQ)"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
