Find a nearby tree and use your hands to gather logs.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong></p>\n<p>Logs can be used to craft a workbench by opening the crafting menu. Place the workbench down anywhere you want outside of the shop. Open the workbench to bring up a menu that displays what you can currently craft,\u00a0you will see more items unlock\u00a0when you reach higher tiers. Your goal in this tier is to craft a wooden pickaxe to start mining stone which can be found nearby. After some mining, you will eventually be able to craft a furnace and smelt stone bringing you to the next tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Stone</strong></p>\n<p>You have now unlocked the ability to craft stone tools at the workbench. Start producing tools to sell at the shop for a good profit. You need to have enough money to buy 8\u00a0iron ore from the shop. Smelt the iron ore\u00a0in the furnace to get iron bringing you to the next tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Iron-Ruby</strong></p>\n<p>Use the iron to craft an\u00a0anvil at the workbench, you will also need to craft a\u00a0hammer to use the anvil. You can craft intermediate+ tools on the anvil by\u00a0selecting what tool to craft in the menu,\u00a0equip a hammer and hit the anvil until the tool is complete.\u00a0Sell tools at the shop to purchase the next unlocked ore. Repeat this process for the remaining tiers.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is in active development and i would love to hear your feedback!\u00a0Many thanks for playing!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>More games by SirHandsomeJack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55db754d26cdb90a2465a4259cdae358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SirHandsomeJack"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
