Set on a space station you as the player are against the clock to accumulate as many points as possible by shooting the colourful orbs spread throughout the level, but be cautious of your health which is decreasing perpetually. With the orbs spawning randomly it occasionally makes sense to venture into the vortex tunnel to quickly accumulate points.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sourced Audio:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music/Effects: Gamemaster Audio, 2017.
