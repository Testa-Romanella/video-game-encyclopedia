{"id": 557927, "slug": "c64-green-felt-classics", "name": "C64 Green Felt Classics", "name_original": "C64 Green Felt Classics", "description": "<p>Three classics \u00a0<strong>Solitaire</strong>, <strong>Yahtzee </strong>and <strong>Blackjack</strong>\u00a0reissued as new BASIC V2 type-in listings for the extra nostalgic experience.</p>\n<p>All three games have in common to make use of the rarely seen ECM (=Extended Color Mode). In this mode each character can have one of\u00a04 different background colors. This\u00a0is great in e.g. card games\u00a0to allow the symbols on the\u00a0cards having a white background while the overall background can remain green.\u00a0The downside of this mode is, that only a total of 64 characters can be displayed at a time, which is the main reason why we don't see this mode more often. But using ECM wisely, brings a complete new and fresh look into C64 games.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note that Solitaire requires a 1351 Commodore mouse to play (in Joystick Port 2). These mice became rare and are nowadays hard to\u00a0find to buy for a reasonable price. However, there are much cheaper adapters you can get in combination with an old PS2 mouse.\u00a0\u00a0Or you can play just in the\u00a0VICE emulator where you can use your standard PC mouse to control the mouse pointer (1351 mouse needs to be enabled in the settings). The other two games are controlled by keyboard.</p>\n<p>And now I hope you will enjoy the forgotten magic of typing in cryptic statements and seeing a running game coming out in the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:12:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55d/55da93358a961d051c98eaf06bc58898.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["romwer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
