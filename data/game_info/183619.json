{"id": 183619, "slug": "serpentine-itch-avatar", "name": "Serpentine (itch) (avatar)", "name_original": "Serpentine (itch) (avatar)", "description": "Arcade Classic<p>This is one of my (many) attempts at going all the way through to polish for a game project. I have a pretty good handle on starting games, but rarely do I polish and finish. But  I want to change that. <br/></p><p>There's little innovation here from the original Snake. Instead I wanted to focus on polish and juiciness as well as colors and perspective. I do like the switch and pattern mechanics though. I feel like you could push those even further, but I feel that I must move on. This has been a HUGE learning project, and I'm very grateful for it. </p><p>If anyone spends $5 or more, I will send you the source code and project files. Feel free to use them for learning or for using in your own projects. </p><br/>Learning<br/><p>I tell anyone wanting to make games to first try to recreate a few of the old arcade classics (e.g. breakout, asteroids, space invaders, tetris, snake, etc). I consider this a kind of curriculum. Nothing will more effectively teach you the joys and foibles of game development. <br/></p><p>The most important aspect to a learning project is to \"finish it\", because if you don't, you might be \"learning\" how to not complete a game, which is a terrible state of affairs. But \"finishing a project\" is a matter of interpretation and what your goals were. </p><p>I will say this though: if you really do not wish to complete a game project that you started, I'd still \"release\" it. Let people see your incomplete game. Tell them what you got out of it and give a good reason why you feel like you need to move on. This not only allows you to maintain some responsibility for your own learning, but it might act as a cognitive release as well. Unfinished projects tend to become mental baggage, because your mind didn't have a proper transition from one project to the next. This could be a way to alleviate that. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d681c1daffef80ab56e070d2c7148c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["avatar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
