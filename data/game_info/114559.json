A ravaging chemical war has led to the contamination of the earth's water bodies leaving them in grave peril, after which the world unites under a single organisation, Rotary. Due to the lack of a proper constitution which lays the guidelines to rule the people Rotary quickly rises to power turning it into an autocracy. Taking control over the last uncontaminated water reserves of the world, Rotary starts selling them to the highest bidders leaving very little for the common populace. As Jagdesh Mukherjee, you join the rebellion to destroy the autocratic regime and give back to the people, what's rightfully theirs<br/></p>\n<p>[ An early prototype, doesn't represent the final product.\u00a0This game is still under development.
