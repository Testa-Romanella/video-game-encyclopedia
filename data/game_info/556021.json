You remember going to sleep, back in your world, on a hill near the cresting lights. Some called it a faerie hill, and warned of kidnapping and dancing and taken to the land of the good folk, the grey folk, the faeries.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut there are no fair folk here, it is empty and lonely and littered with hollow bones. You have only one thought: to return back home. But how? How. The experience is beautiful and immersive. Expect to get lost, and love finding the interesting places you discover.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game contains:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Non-linear layout. Defeat any boss in any order you like. Find any item in any order you like. Solve puzzles using whatever tools you have on hand.<br/>\r\n-No health bar. You fade away each time you get hit, until you completely disappear<br/>\r\n-Only two items. One for each hand, each time you want a new one, you have to drop an old one. This leads to interesting strategy and puzzle solving<br/>\r\n-You can pick up anything and use it as an item<br/>\r\n-Speed run and game challenge tools. Press escape, turn on the speed run timer or the kill count timer. Try beating the game with 0 kills! It's hard, but not impossible. Or beat the game with only 5 kills. Or 100! <br/>\r\n-Multiple different ways to solve each puzzle in the game. This allows players to find their own way.<br/>\r\n-A full Day/Night cycle<br/>\r\n-A weather cycle including fog, rain, overcast<br/>\r\n-Fifty four unique maps, creating a unique, miniature world<br/>\r\n-Four bosses.
