TURN YOUR VOLUME DOWN!</p>\n<p>Hi, I made this game back in my first semester of my senior year in High School. Everyday I would come into my AP Computer Science class with new additions from the night before. It definitely caught the attention of nearby students and friends, giving pretty consistent feedback. They enjoyed it and it was what kept me experimenting with new ideas and mechanics. This was the first time I ever really worked with mocap animation on a rigged model, IK, and AI on friendly/Enemy bots in a third person setting. First time I ever attempted a third person shooter as well.</p>\n<p>Anyways, this game is an homage to those old plastic army men, green vs tan video games by 3DO back in the day.</p>\n<p>You have 5 weapons and can switch between them with the number keys lining about qwerty.<br/>1 - Assault Rifle: Stock standard, press 'X' to switch fire modes between single shot and fully automatic.<br/>2 - Bazooka: Don't fire this thing when you stand close. Jump and fire it on the ground for something funny.<br/>3 - Sniper Rifle : Hold down right click to zoom.<br/>4 - Flamethrower : Kind of runs out of ammo fast and you can accidentally light yourself on fire if you'e too close.<br/>G - Grenade : Funny thing... you can throw a grenade at anytime, even mid-fire, without interrupting your firing a hitch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07356f07557d810a347c5576e9f15a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RejectedJake"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
