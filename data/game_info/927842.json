Kind of ran out of time to do the art and most design features, so consider this game incomplete. The battle system is one I developed for another project and adapted for this game's needs. Some day this game might get finished, or not... All it needs is some context and visuals for wins, losses, level ups, etc. I'll probably just go back to the original project, though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T17:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f5f35fcb52638f867d02407de2d676b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dynid"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
