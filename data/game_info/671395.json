{"id": 671395, "slug": "assignment_1", "name": "Assignment_1", "name_original": "Assignment_1", "description": "Context\r\n\n<p>Inspired by\u00a0Kasper H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m's new music video for Radiohead's <em>If Yo Say The Word.\u00a0</em>I tried to recreate the \"mildly\" disturbing morning routine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Level 1 shows wild\u00a0employees in their natural habitat, where they were hunted by the farmers/hunters to sell to the national capitalists.</p>\n<p>- Level 2 shows an unforeseen traffic accident, where we see our protagonist trying to escape back into the wild.</p>\n<p>- Level 3 we see a domesticated protagonist waiting for the right time and sign wink wink.</p>\n\r\nSome fun features I thought of:\r\n<p>1. Show a seemingly pointless quote when the player dies\u00a0like the classic COD series.</p>\n<p>2. Make the title scene focus on our player model walking since this is all you'll get to do the whole game.</p>\n\r\nSome stuff I figured out along the way:\r\n<p>1. To play 2 different BGMs in Menu and Game settings.</p>\n<p>2. Use the same animating method to make the coin hover and move as the walking sequence of our\u00a0protagonist.</p>\r\nStuffs need to be addressed:\r\n<p>1. Haven't figure out the bug where the \"item acquired\" sound effect won't play after added in the\u00a0BGM.</p>\n<p>2. Haven't being able to make a set path for my enemies, tried a pre-written scripts but the result is not optimal.</p>\n<p>3. Not able to figure how to animate the fellow wild employees like the stereotype animals turning their heads/bodies back and forth in time.</p>\r\nLessons Learned:\r\n<p>1. Since I'm going for a 2.5D setting, I modified my player's collider a bit shorter than the sprite display, to create a more organic feel of space.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nFuture...\r\n<p>To create a more dynamic system, incorporate more flowing variables (scores, coffees, some other sorts of credentials, tokens...) to make the overall gameplay more engaging. Also adding more movements to the npcs and maybe even pointless dialogs,(in the form of a conversation bubble) to really hit home the post-modern existential dread. The metaphors of collectibles still need to be tidied up, right now it's just a group of mundane tokens you'll find in a normal city morning.</p><br/>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6c/c6cbbfec37198303dead080245718995.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chooseimage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
