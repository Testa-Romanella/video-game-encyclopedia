Primarily I\u00a0wanted to encourage the player to live in the present moment, and relax and feel peace.\u00a0I also took it as being \"physically present\" which the main character (Leaf)'s physical presence causes plants around her to spring to life. It's also applied to the fact that she's trying to give the sapling she carries the gift of a permanent proper home in a clearing in the forest to help the forest continue to thrive.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44b97efe0eb690f34d34ce0a8f6118df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["raespark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
