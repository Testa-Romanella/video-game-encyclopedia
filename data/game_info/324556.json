You must navigate the facility you've been trapped in to collect 6 red orbs. After collecting 6 the final purple orb will be revealed. Once touched, the white block which blocks the exit will open, and you may leave.</p>\n<p>Be warned, for there are 2 things to stop your way, and they are relentless.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD For basic movement.<br/>Left Shift to sprint<br/>Space to jump<br/>Space (hold) to wall climb or wall jump (only works on &gt; 45 degree angle from the wall, based on the camera direction)<br/>Space (in the air) to double jump<br/>Right click (down) to fire grapple hook<br/>Right click (release) to release grapple</p>\n<p>Notes:\u00a0<br/>Recommend 50% volume due to audio glitches.<br/></p>\n<p>Also the game doesn't actually have a proper ending. However if you hit the 7th orb and make it through the blocked area to the final area, you've sufficiently beat the game.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<p>Thiccvana for Voice Acting the robot girl</p>\n<p>AlienTree for the music and audio</p>\n<p>Aurum for the character designs, concepts, art and ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T04:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/537b00e931d9cdfa297005142583e42b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwoPieceVypur"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
