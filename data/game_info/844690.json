Theme: As Above, So Below.</p>\n<p>Choose two characters to guide through these randomly generated mazes of fate towards their ultimate destiny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD controls both the top and bottom characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ESC to pause</p>\n<p>Win the game by bringing both characters together.\u00a0Gather pickups to increase your score. Try to get the highest score in the least amount of time.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Difficulty level increases the size of the maze which will increase loading time slightly as the bigger mazes need more time to generate. It also increases the number of points available so bigger mazes mean higher scores!</p>\n<p>The mazes in this game are generated using a perfect algorithm, which means that there is always a path to your target. No Maze is unsolvable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All characters were intended to have paired animations from the RamsterZ Paired Animation pack, but in the end I didn't have time to implement them for everyone. For now, Shinbi is the only one with paired animations\u00a0(with Serath, Murdock, and Zinx).\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were a lot of cut features that I'd still like to add at some point. There's quite a few spots where I'd like to add more audio files as well. I may come back once the jam is over to update and bring the project up to my original vision.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T08:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/6494749e1fc41d438e31834753258a8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wolvenna"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
