For example: Tap chain of 1s to make 2, Tap chain of 2s to make 3 and so on. Although, there is one exception, merging a chain of zeros makes a single zero.<br/><br/>The goal is to make at least 2 nines and merge them together.  Along the way you'll have the help of 2 power ups: Swap and Hammer.  Hammer allows you to smash a tile, while Swap allows you to switch positions of two tiles (excluding nine).<br/><br/>While the gameplay is simple, merging two nines is not always easy to do.  If you do succeed in merging two 9s, try to merge two 9s again or go for three 9s and score even higher.<br/><br/>Game center integration for top scores, total nines made, total points earned and total nines merged.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6eec8149282c9ce61d7b227cc14b1c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Steve Boschi"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["steve boschi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
