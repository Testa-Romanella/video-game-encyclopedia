Some idiot in the lab accidentally activated the subatomic bomb that will most likely oblitarate the whole universe if it explodes !!!\u00a0\r\n(First bomb of it's kind, so who knows...)\r\n<p><strong>Luckily it's mounted on top of a missile, can you fly it into a black hole in time to save everyone? But, oh no... It's not fast enough! You need to use planets with boost holes if you want to make it!</strong></p>\n\n<p>A game where collecting speed-ups is just as imprtant as avoiding them</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>This is our first time joining a game jam, big thanks to BrackeysTeam! Our goal was to have fun, make a game taking place in the same game universe as our main project, PlanetRealm, and hopefully finish it in time. We succeeded, now we hope it's also fun\u00a0 for all of you to play!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not sure if this goes without saying but this is a game jam game, there's bugs. And glitches. Oh, there's MANY bugs and glitches.</p>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>- Download .rar or .zip file</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Unpack</p>\n<p>- Run \"Bomb In A Hole\"</p>\n<p>- Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Made With Unity</p>\n<p>Aside from our own stuff we helped ourselves with these great assets:</p>\n<p>- \"Polygonal's Low-Poly Particle Pack\" by Polygonal Stuff</p>\n<p>- \"Rockets, Missiles &amp; Bombs - Cartoon Low Poly Pack\" by AurynSky</p>\n<p>- \"Sci-Fi Music Pack 1\" by pdkmusic</p>\n<p>- Sound effects found on\u00a0freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:50:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569e8231b41b32ecb2811fd4dcd22a0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlanetRealm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
