Zelle has the unfortunate coincidence of having a vaguely magical-girl like appearance, which was apparently enough for this... \"magical talking dog scientist\" to entrust her with the power to save their world.<br/></p>\n<p>Does that sound ridiculous? Well that's because it is!!</p>\n<p>Join Zelle, the annoyed middle aged secretary as she's forced to fight the zombie apocalypse caused by fanboys trying to create \"The waifu of their dreams\". Convinced that bitch from HR must have spiked her drink with something, she decides to play along and hope she can make it home to play her switch later.</p>\n<p>Featuring:</p>\n<p>-Custom art</p>\n<p>-A blend of genres so strange it was powerful enough to convince you to keep reading</p>\n<p>-A side-view action rpg system</p>\n<p>-The existential question of if this the zombie apocalypse, and this dog is a scientist, THEN WHO IS DRIVING THE CAR?!?</p>\n<p>Note: I'm proud to say this short 10-15 minute game was made with my girlfriend, who always supports the things I do. I hope all of you can enjoy it.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447099a65f42b0fb58cba8731c5ded8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TheLastYuriSamurai"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
