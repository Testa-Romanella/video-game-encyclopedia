So be careful which path you'll go to choose. Most of them are deadly!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Because of the limited amount of time for the development, the gameplay is not very long and there are some little mistakes in level design and grammar, which I'm very sorry. <strong>18Levels + BossFight</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Because of my passion for making strange things in my games. I add a stupid and non-sense story about one of my projects characters.\u00a0<br/>The main character of the game is also the narrator/teacher.. in the dialogues you can find a lot of grammar mistakes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>## Controls</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>:\u00a0 \u00a0- Movements\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Arrow Keys</strong>:\u00a0 - Shooting\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SPACE:</strong> - SuperPower\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>X</strong>:\u00a0 Interaction with dialogues\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Close dialogues\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That's everything!!
