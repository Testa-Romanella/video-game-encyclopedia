Use your powers to move cars at will to help him get as far as possible in this hectic game.</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Comments:\u00a0<br/></strong>This was my first online Game Jam and it was quite fun. I think I'll try to join more to get better at making games.\u00a0<br/>I'm not that happy about how this game turned out, but at least I finished it. In future jams I'll probably look for a team so I don't have to rely on royalty free artwork and sounds.\u00a0<br/>I could have done better by investing more time into polish and game design.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\r\n<br/></strong>freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/\r\n<br/>purple-planet.com\r\n<br/>zapsplat.com\r\n<br/>opengameart.org/content/free-top-down-car-sprites-by-unlucky-studio</p>\n<p>And of course the good people of the Game Maker's Toolkit Discord for positive attitude\u00a0and motivating words.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30a/30a763ae96725a1bb53af0f95da321bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ViliamVadocz"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
