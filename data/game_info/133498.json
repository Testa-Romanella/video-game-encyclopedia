Everything else you need to know is explained ingame.<br/><br/>The main inspiration was the android game\u00a0VoxelRush 3D, wich is also pretty cool.<br/><br/>The game features two (two!) gamemodes, a super fast action gameplay, fancy colors, and you can actually save your highscore if you quit the game using the \"Quit Game\" button in the menu.<br/><br/>Differences between the two gamemodes:<br/>In Classic mode you have random events every 45 seconds for 15 secs. You can use a boost for a short time and also there are items to collect (lives, shield &amp; boost).<br/>In Clean mode you don't have these features</p>\n\n<p>GitHub</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fd/9fd081ee20fa20c7c6659db7407fbf92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chopsuey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
