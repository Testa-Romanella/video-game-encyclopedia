With no one else on the payroll, it's just you and Auto-Dish, the friendly robot companion for Auto-Cooking Industries.</p>\n<p>Made for Wowie\u00a0Jam 4.0, this game follows the theme \"Collaborate with AI\". Your job is to listen to customer requests and help Auto-Dish learn to generate tailored Dishes for them. By buying Dishes from Auto-Dish, it will learn and adjust existing configurations for that specific request. Over time, you can perfect dishes this way and reach 5 medals.</p>\n<p>More medals? More money, more time. You're on the clock at Auto-Diner and you've got limited funds. Impress those customers or they wont pay enough to keep you going!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have time to add any music. Feel free to listen to your own!</p>\n\n<p><em>Unique Flavours was made by one person (me) with all assets being my own creation.</em></p>\n<p><em>Game made by:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like this game?</p>\n<p>Checkout HIVE on steam!
