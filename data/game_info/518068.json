Every living soul has its own spot reserved in the underworld, and while the doll can still use her blade to weaken the forces of evil, she can no longer banish them, because you cannot banish someone to the place they're already at. As such, Pawn has to collect their weakened souls instead.<br/>As she ventures deeper and deeper into the layers of the underworld, Pawn is going to face many enemies, big and small, until she finds out what has caused the unrest among the banished.</p>\n<p>The game is currently in development, but a trial version is available to download.</p>\n<p>Upcoming features:<br/>- campaign mode with 20 levels, 5 bosses and multiple endings<br/>- saving and loading\u00a0replays<br/>- soundtrack<br/>- a better level editing environment</p>\n<p>Inspired by Highly Responsive to Prayers by Team Shanghai Alice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T05:31:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/291/291995952b5dbfc1d5b830155d6d323b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zejgar"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
