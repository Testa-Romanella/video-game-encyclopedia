As the remains of humanity wither and rot, zealous foes fester in the ruins. They spare no mercy, with survival demanding superior awareness, precision and instincts. Track down hidden sanctums of devout followers and discover your true purpose.<br />\nPosses Lost Warriors<br />\nThe dead litter this tattered landscape, but not all are without hope. The lost remains of defeated warriors are yours to discover. Awaken these Mortal Shells, occupy their bodies and significantly open your understanding to diverse masteries of combat.<br />\nFace Haunting Foes<br />\nYour path is guarded by desperate adversaries, devoted to inscrutable gods. Behold creatures both pitiable and grotesque, but do not let fear halt your journey. Muster your courage and face them down.<br />\nIron Sharpens Iron<br />\nCombat is strategic and deliberate. You must commit your sword only when an opportunity opens. Calculate your parries to unleash devastating counterblows. Temporarily entomb your Mortal Shell in stone to block attacks, or play aggressive and use your stone-form to add brutal weight to your own sword swings.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2020-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T19:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b3/0b32976c5406a0a646cfc4cdc2297b17.jpg", "website": "https://www.mortalshell.com/", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 154, "owned": 1159, "beaten": 110, "toplay": 149, "dropped": 143, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 122, "ratings_count": 215, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 224, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["PlayStack", "Cold Symmetry"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["PlayStack"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
