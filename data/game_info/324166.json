Let's decide the number from 1 to 10 at random and use that value. There are four game modes. Aim for a high score!<br/>\n<br/>\r\ngame<br/>\r\nThe target value is randomly determined from 1 to 10. Assign 1 to 10 randomly determined numbers to the 5 x 5 panel. Operators are randomly placed in 4 panels each. If the result is the target value, the numbers disappear and the score is added.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame mode<br/>\r\n\u30fb Classic<br/>\r\nIt is a normal mode without any change. If you can not put numbers on the panel, the game is over. Perhaps this mode will be the longest continuous play mode.<br/>\r\n\u30fb Time attack<br/>\r\nWe will compete how many numbers can be erased in 120 seconds. Believe in your judgment and intuition and aim for a high score.<br/>\r\n\u30fb Move mode<br/>\r\nNumbers can be placed up to 30 times. Erase multiple numbers at the same time and get high points with combo bonus.<br/>\r\n\u00b7Zen<br/>\r\nUnlike other modes, it is possible to replace numbers. You can continue indefinitely.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8ac1e8ba9cff16f277b6275d504d227.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sakastudio"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["sakastudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
