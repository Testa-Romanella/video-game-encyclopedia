The block teleportation only starts after the player moves or jumps, after that the block will start to teleport from teleporter to teleporter in the order the player set it to be. Makes it both a challenging puzzle and a challenging platformer.</p>Controls:<ul><li>A + D or Left Arrow + Right Arrow to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>R to restart</li><li>Mouse to click</li></ul>\n<p>Personally, I had a lot of fun doing this game. I really liked this idea and it was totally worth putting the effort to make it.<br/>The music is mine, I made it a couple of months ago. During the jam, I extended it a bit :)</p>\n<p>For now, the game is not saving any progress on browser, so avoid refreshing the page!</p>\n<p><em>P.S: if you have trouble clicking on the screen without the page moving from place to place, click on fullscreen mode.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be240f5cda3737e82fd0b6166d1504fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lookjaklook"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
