This takes place on floating terraces and involves a tiny challenge with light up panels. It\u2019s a lonely existence with little to do, but physics simulations are fun to knock around for a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY IS THIS?</strong></p>\n<p>Originally created this July 4th, 2014 as a break from another prototype. Before I made this prototype, I created a similar concept as a Blender game (yep) and it had more to see and do, so maybe I\u2019ll find a nice way to provide that experience, as well, eventually.
