Best played with four players, three of them take the roles of the heroes, and the other of the dungeon itself!</p>\n<p>The heroes\u00a0<strong>must</strong>\u00a0use game pad controllers (XBox/Playstation works well) and the dungeon master uses the mouse and keyboard. The controls for the PCs are:</p>\n<ol><li>Right trigger - shoot</li><li>Right bumper - Secondary ability (if applicable)</li><li>Primary button (A on Xbox, X on PS controllers) triggers your Ultimate ability</li></ol>\n<p>The DM uses tab to cycle between monsters or traps, right click to rotate, and left click to place! Each item costs $, so save up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/414450cc386a07793a800c61e1025121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["John Harger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
