You can fight all of the monsters in the game to level up and find rare drops. Use a pick axe to mine for ore from the underground to use in manufacturing stronger weapons and armor. Collect parts of monsters and use the cauldron to transform them into rare potions. Fish for food during your travels -- if you are lucky you might snag your hook on something heavy from the bottom of a lake. Be careful in your explorations; PVP can occur almost anywhere. Hunt enemy town players to raise your PVP score. You are not able to enter enemy shops/warehouses, but you are able to invade their town for limited times. Party with your fellow townspeople to hunt stronger monsters or enemy town folk!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T05:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a73bca699d8ae7d72c60ebc6db4bd69.jpg", "website": "https://howlbreath.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Howlbreath"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Howlbreath"], "esrb_rating": null}
