It is more fun if you experience them with no prior knowledge to what they do (this makes the game more unpredictable and wild) but if you\u00a0<em>must\u00a0</em>know what they are:</p>\n<p><strong>Bug </strong><strong>Attack </strong>- several quick bug (electronic) enemies travel from the left side of the screen. These will always take two shots to destroy but can be destroyed by colliding with a tower. They are not affected by the vibe.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Overclocked </strong>- the game speeds up for around 15 seconds by 2 times.</p>\n<p><strong>Malware</strong> - anywhere from 3 to 5 of your existing towers are destroyed</p>\n<p><strong>Trojan </strong><strong>Horses</strong> - 3 Trojan horses travel from the right side of the screen. They have a lot of health and destroy towers with little to no effort.</p>\n<p><strong>DDOS </strong><strong>attack </strong>- your screen becomes littered with tabs for around 15 seconds, making it very difficult to see.</p>\n<p>In addition to these events, at fixed intervals the game will speed up, making it increasingly harder to react to all the incoming enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T02:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df5b47add7190c72160c20051e888e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bredstickxxx"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
