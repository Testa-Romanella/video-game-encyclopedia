You play as the light and the dark the game is based on the backing track that was given to us by Babii.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project is also made for her as well.</p>\n<p>The project was set out over a 9 week-ish period where we had to come up with an idea based on the song in the game. We came up with using Mirror to the literal sense and made a game that your actions are mirrored no matter the activity. This was made for a Uni project. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bugs\u00a0and Systems</strong></p>\n<p>The game has a few little collisions bugs and there is no clear winner in the game. The game is based on how far you can go and how many points you can get doing it. The game is set up so if one of your characters loses their health the game is over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game does not have a pause.<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Babii for asking us to make this project and giving us the song to base the project on!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Here are her links and socials:<br/>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BABii_mp3<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/babii.mp3/<br/>BandCamp: https://babii.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Josh - Coder of the project<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheJoshhyyy<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Toby - The leader of the project<br/>Link To Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/ToastIsABiscuit<br/>Link\u00a0To Itch :\u00a0https://tobycarlyon.itch.io/ <br/></p>\n<p>Aoife -\u00a0Artist of the project<br/>Link To Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/pebblefriend<br/>Link To Itch Page:\u00a0https://pebblefriend.itch.io/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d244f179a0e9f94c87eb2d018beee507.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toby Carlyon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
