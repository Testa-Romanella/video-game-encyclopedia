This week's theme was 'Cthulu', hence the (hastely drawn) \u00a0giant eyeball in the background.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to simply survive. You get 4 hits, after that you lose and can start again. also you have a cannon to defend yourself.<br/></p>\n<p>One of my first works so it's incredibly crude what with the self-drawn art and no music. I actually had some other features in the works but alas the deadline happened. In future I've got to figure out a way to be more efficient with my dev time - like to have a more specific todo list or something. Well anyway, enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f665073601f76a80e1271403feaa6a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wisewhale9000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
