There are a lot of Top-Down shooter games out there, but I figured there's not so many Top-Down games which highlight melee combats.</p>\n<p>I tried to make Melees give you satisfying melee combat experiences, and so far, I'm happy with how it feels. Before taking the next big step, working on enemies with sophisticated AI, I want to get some feedback. What do you think?
