These chips can be implanted at egg, baby, teen and adult stages. Each stage has different event chips which effect the end personality of the lifeform.  </p>\n<p>Once created the life is visually generated in a different way each time. Once generated you can learn from this life by simply conversing with it.</p>\n<p>Your personal personality is also tracked based on the dialogue options you select when conversing with the computer life.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy creating and conversing with all 12 personality archetypes :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb6/eb694a2056c03df685b548a215616a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry Prebble"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
