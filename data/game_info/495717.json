Lovecraft, where players explore and investigate a large open world map, progressing though an engaging and exciting story. It is a mobile phone adaption of the classic text-based adventure genre, similar to the point-and-click classics. The game combines a bleak environment, an sense of underlying dread, and several action sequences with moments of comedy to keep you entertained. <br/><br/>As a sequel to the acclaimed \"Horror in the Darkness\", our protagonist arrives at the small fishing village of Innsport searching for young Lacy Wentsire. Reclusive and decrepit, the village holds it's own secrets and doesn't welcome outsiders.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T02:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f5e3bb1cd12ed36f43d24e87f3b4cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Karmic Shift Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Software Design Solutions"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
