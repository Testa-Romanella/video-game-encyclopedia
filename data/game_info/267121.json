No matter, your heroism knows no bounds!\u00a0Prepare yourself for a super amazing quest of unknown proportions!\u00a0Or don't, its not like you're a serious hero or anything anyways.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00a0</em>\u00a0Instructions<br/>Use the arrow keys to control your hero. Use Z to jump and X to strike with your super amazing weapon. That's it. There is nothing else.
