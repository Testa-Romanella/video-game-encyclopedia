Click on cells to bring them to life, press play to watch them grow and retreat, and use the patterns you find to solve puzzles.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:22:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b7/3b761f68866c524d7fbbed3f48ce7f10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fallenspring Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
