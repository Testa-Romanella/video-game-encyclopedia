Inspiration for this game has come from my years as a boy scout and my completed NOBO hike of the\u00a0 Appalachian trail.</p>\n<p>I want to simulate the most fundamental daily activities you do while camping and create a gameplay loop that involves performing these tasks while attempting a hike.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this short demo you must follow the marked trail and make it to the end without starving. To eat you must collect sticks to fuel a campfire to cook your food. You can also poop to reduce your bowel meter, but consequences for a full bowel have not been implemented. Happy Hiking!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Simple Movement can be done with WASD, but if you want to go fast you must alternate the hiking inputs. When hiking in order to turn you must hold down on Turn input to align yourself with your look direction.\u00a0</p><p>Both keyboard and gamepad are supported. For now,\u00a0\u00a0whichever control you use to start the game will\u00a0lock you in to that control scheme. If you would like to switch you will need to exit and reenter and start the game with the other scheme.</p>\r\n\r\nAction         -&gt;    Keyboard + Mouse | Gamepad\r\nPause          -&gt;                   ~ | Start\r\n------- MOVEMENT -------\r\nHiking (alternating)-&gt;       Q and E  | Left and Right Bumper\r\nTurn (Hold)    -&gt;         Left Mouse  | D-Pad Up Hold\r\nCreep Forward  -&gt;                   W | Left Stick Up\r\nCreep Backward -&gt;                   S | Left Stick Back\r\nSpin Left      -&gt;                   A | Left Stick Left\r\nSpin Right     -&gt;                   D | Left Stick Right\r\nLook           -&gt;               Mouse | Right Stick\r\nStart Grabbing -&gt;         Right mouse | Button West\r\nStart Fire     -&gt;                   F | D-Pad Left\r\nStart Pooping  -&gt;                   P | D-Pad Down\r\n------- GRABBING -------\r\nPick up        -&gt;          Left Mouse | Button South\r\nExit grabbing  -&gt;         Right Mouse | Button East\r\n------- Pooping -------\r\nStrike Ground  -&gt;          Move Mouse | Left Stick\r\nDig Hole (Hold)-&gt;          Left Mouse | Button South \r\nDrop Dirt (Release)-&gt;      Left Mouse | Button South \r\nAfter Hole is dug :\r\nPoop           -&gt;               Space | Button North\r\nClean Up       -&gt;                  C  | Button West\r\nExit Pooping   -&gt;                   P | Button East\r\n------- Fire --------\r\nDrag sticks    -&gt;  Mouse + Left Mouse | Left Stick + Button South\r\nLight fire     -&gt;               Space | Button North\r\nPut food into pot-&gt;                 W | Left Bumper\r\nEat cooked Food -&gt;                  E | Right Bumper\r\nClean up Fire  -&gt;                   C | Button West\r\nExit Fire Pit  -&gt;                   F | Button East\r\n\r\n\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>This is an early demo so frustration with controls or lack of gameplay is an expected reaction and bugs are probably creeping around.\u00a0Any questions or suggestions can be made here or on the discord\u00a0:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/gFxt9NWPHS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T06:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/8598dedd819ca1bf456d9b128a70c5f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fkhaller"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
