You start the game by first creating your base planet with the order given to you, you select the amount then move onto creating the layers (which is formed by asteroids hitting the planet). From there, you then create the atmosphere by releasing gases into the air from volcanos and then lastly you garnish the creation with moons or a ring if the order calls for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created in two days at the Indie Galactic Space Jam in Orlando, Florida September 29th - October 1st</p>\n<p>TEAM</p>\n<p>William Lopez</p>\n<p>Tucker Apy</p>\n<p>Cody Jordan</p>\n<p>Braxton Lowers</p>\n<p>Alex Heck</p>\n<p>Rachel Belton</p>\n<p>Patrick Murr</p>\n<p>Brian Luft</p>\n<p>Heather Miller</p>\n<p>Jay</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab2/ab2df78a73598a429ae739c62f0dc005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["planetchef"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
