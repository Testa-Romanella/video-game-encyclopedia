Some sketchy like hand drawn sprites.</p>\n<strong><em>- Gameplay -</em></strong>\n<p>You can pick stuff up with the left mouse button and interact with them with the right mouse button while picked up. You scroll the level with A and D or mouse at the edges of the screen. Put the fruits in the basket and the bugs into the bucket. Some glithes are present but I don't know how to fix em.</p>\r\nPS The baskets hitbox is small and in the bottom of it if you want to pick it up and you have to shake bugs so that they would fall.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b0713dd4352aa10a7aa498411156ac6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MK"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
