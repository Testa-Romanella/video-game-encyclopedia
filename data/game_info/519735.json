For each blocked attack, you get 1 point added to your \"Block Score\".<br/>When you land an attack on your opponent, the block score is added to your total score +5. You need 50 points to win!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Daigo -KEYBOARD-<br/>-Arrow keys to move<br/>-Space bar to attack<br/>-Shift key to block</p>\n<p>Steven -CONTROLLER-<br/>-D-pad to move<br/>-\"A\" to attack<br/>-\"B\" to block</p>\n<p>CREDIT:</p>\n<p>Whiff and Block sounds-Freesound<br/>\u201cSound Search.\u201d Freesound, https://freesound.org/search/?q=slap.</p>\n<p>Music- \"Ryu's Theme\" Street Fighter II, Yoko Shimomura, Isao Abe<br/>Street Fighter II (1991) Capcom</p>\n<p>All other resources created by me (Adam Frank)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50ff60bf4340095a34f7ce5d54c4b6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["afamdrank"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
