{"id": 896611, "slug": "mushrooman", "name": "MUSHROOMAN", "name_original": "MUSHROOMAN", "description": "MUSHROOM is an atmospheric first\u2014person survival horror game.<h3>Instead Of A Plot</h3>Late at night you were driving along the highway among dense forests, bright stars illuminated your path, mighty fir trees swayed in the wind and everything was fine\u2026 However, your car suddenly ran out of gas and you had to stop in this dark wilderness. Try to find a gas station, but be careful, because you are not alone here. Something terrible (for example, giant fly agarics) is roaming in these forests. <br/><br/><h3>Weapons and Items</h3>Use all the useful items that you can find. To survive, you need to explore the location. Use food and water, pills and first aid kits to heal your wounds and restore strength. A lantern or candles will help you not get lost in this dark forest, and a gun will allow you to fight back against aggressive monsters, or at least feel not so helpless. <br/><br/><h3>Place Of Action</h3>In the best traditions of the genre, this is a forest. Dense dark forest. Try to memorize the area and follow the map so as not to get lost and not disturb the local inhabitants. Although, what am I talking about, they will notice you anyway.<br/><br/><h3>Gameplay Features</h3><ul><li> Classic indie horror atmosphere on Unity. You are all alone here, no help will come, a dim flashlight (which also constantly runs out of batteries) is your only friend. <br/></li><li> An atmospheric night forest that you need to explore if you want to get out of here.<br/></li><li> Search for weapons and other useful items. This will help you survive.<br/></li><li> Detailed menu of graphics settings, management and saving progress.<br/></li><li> Killer mushrooms.</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T03:49:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e4081e1e93676c8a82f49f491208620b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astra Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astra Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
