These beings are known as the \u201cAegis of Erutia\u201d, and the mark on each one\u2019s body, as well as their untapped amounts of Ether from within, is a testament to that.</p>\n<p> That was how this Deity decided to shape their world, and each Deity was meant to shape their world--and theirs alone-- as they willed.<br/> Yet one such Deity desired more\u2026</p>\n<p> <strong>Gameplay/Features (Current Demo):</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Two types of areas: <strong>Fields</strong>, which focus on seeing new monsters and exploring wide areas, and <strong>Dungeons</strong>, which focus on solving puzzles and gaining treasures.\r\n</li><li>You know the \"colorful cast of characters\" alliteration?
