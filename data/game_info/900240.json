He didn't want it to collect dust in his closet, so he decided to host a card game to decide who takes the sword. He grabbed a couple of chumps from a tavern somewhere, and told them to duke it out at cards. Hades was intrigued by this and about two rounds in the game he decided it would be fun to start placing bets, but unfortunately for the two contestants Hades has a bit of a temper, which wouldn't be a problem for you, if only you weren't one of the contestants. <br/></p>\n<p>Win 5 rounds to win the sword but make sure Hades' wallet doesn't run dry. <br/></p>\n<p>Sometimes you'll have to throw a round in order to win the competition and live to tell about it.</p>\n<p>This was submitted for Mini Jam 122: intermission, with the Limitation: Losing is Good<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/776/77600f364f3754aed87f7d5104c5bd83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheLowestByte"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
