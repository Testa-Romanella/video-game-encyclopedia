Join our Discord channel and spill the beans!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dear archer hero, it's time to answer the call of the world and complete the necessary challenges to become a god!<br/>Using your skillful archery skills, different arrows and the blessings of the bow gods, you can easily destroy all kinds of enemies and complete a variety of challenges.<br/>Don't forget to defeat your challengers, they don't want you to become a god!<br/><br/><h3>Shoot!</h3>Draw an arrow from your pack, then build up your strength and shoot at the enemy! The greater the force, the faster the arrow and the more damage it will do to the enemy.<br/>A shot that hits an enemy may break their joints and slow them down. There is a chance of a blast effect or even a kill shot!<h3>Enemy armour</h3>Enemies do not always reveal their flesh and blood, but usually wear armour of varying strengths in different torso positions, including light, medium and heavy armour.<br/><br/>Usually some enemies will be able to tell at a glance which type of armour is dominant, while others will need to be tried with an arrow.<br/>Each part of the armour has its own durability value and will protect its owner with a response damage reduction parameter until it is depleted, but some arrows can penetrate directly regardless of the armour.<h3>Types of arrows</h3>When facing enemies without armour, or wearing light, medium or heavy armour, the different types of arrows are more effective and are<br/><strong>Normal arrows</strong> - average muzzle velocity, penetrate light armour and dent medium armour, but break when encountering heavy armour<br/><strong>Barbed arrow</strong> - higher muzzle velocity, penetrates and deals a lot of damage to unarmored and light armour, breaks on medium and heavy armour<br/><strong>Flat arrow</strong> - low muzzle velocity, dents almost all armour and loses a lot of durability<br/><strong>Sharp Arrows</strong> - Very high muzzle velocity, can penetrate all armour types including heavy armour, but do less damage<br/>Normal arrows are infinite and you will automatically harvest other arrows from the Bow God on a regular basis, so remember to be flexible!<br/><br/><h3>Growth</h3>You gain experience by hitting enemies. Each time you accumulate a certain amount of experience you can upgrade and choose one of three random growth paths. Feel free to choose your own direction of development!<h3>God Wishes</h3>Wishes will accumulate automatically over time, and each successful shot will accumulate more wishes. When they are full, they unleash powerful aspirations.<br/>These skills last for a while and come in different types: from rapid fire and knockback to charm and disguise, each of which has its own use to help you defeat the enemy.<br/><h3>Divine Rites</h3>Each time you achieve a part of your goal, you will receive a gift from the gods. You can choose from a variety of different rewards, from special passive skills, divine wishes or special arrows.<br/><br/><h3>Bow</h3>Find bows with different attributes from all over the map, or from dead enemies, and use them with a passive skill or a divine wish to achieve outstanding results.<h3>Quests or the Bow God</h3>Complete a series of quests for the Bow God and collect crystal shards to cement your path to godhood. As your strength increases, you can receive various levels and quests such as defence, assault, sneaking and collecting.<h3>Special helpers</h3>Skeletons in tombstones, locked gates, stone throwers for defence, carefully erected stone balls, rickety suspension bridges - the mechanics in each mission will be a great help to you!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Development Plan</h3><h3>DEMO</h3>The Archer Hero DEMO is now available for play. Come and experience the unique dual-stick archery gameplay and tell us what you think to help us iterate!<br/><br/><h3>Feedback</h3>You can give us your feedback via Discord or the Steam community.
