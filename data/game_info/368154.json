Players may race alone, or with up to three other friends in splitscreen matches.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCritter Kart currently features 5 unique locations, 11 playable characters, and 8 pointstreak rewards to add gameplay variety. Races can be customized to suit any session length or playstyle by giving players the freedom to choose the number of karts, laps, and the difficulty of their opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile Critter Kart's explosive physics-driven gameplay allows players to blast opponents off the track and make them spiral through the air, options exist for players to ease motion sickness including: permanent kart armor which prevents enemies from sending the player flying, comfort blinders that ease in with movement, and a fully-static arcade mode that allows players to grab the virtual steering wheel without motion sickness.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c4d8085ab425a9967790dfce416c4a9.jpg", "website": "https://www.critterkartracing.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["James Roznick"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["James Roznick"], "esrb_rating": null}
