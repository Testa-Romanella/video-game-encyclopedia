This is my 14th bio-inspired simulation. This version has less customization options than the 2D version, since it can get a little expensive to render depending on the initial settings. Unfortunately compute shaders in WebGL are yet not supported by any computer graphics APIs, maybe in the furute I'll redo this in WebGPU.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Made as a part of an assignment from @Arsiliath course to write compute shaders in Unity.
