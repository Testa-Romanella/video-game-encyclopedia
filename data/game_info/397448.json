There are only 2 levels, the menu is out of proportion (it will be redone), the controls are a little wonky (they will be redone as well), and there was a story in development as well (probably won't happen). This was in the very early stages before production was put on hold. Though it's current model is built for PC, it will probably end up on mobile if released. Screenshots will be added if released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T04:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed3238d60d93ef7a21963d0be099881c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Session"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
