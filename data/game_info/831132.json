July '22 (Year 1: Month 2)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>* Local multiplayer:\u00a0Wired controllers recommended\u00a0</strong><strong>(ps5/ps4/switch/xbox) *</strong></p>\n<p>This is a game I made for my friends, and I plan to make more!<em>\u00a0<strong>(2 - 8 players) (has not been tested with more than 4 people)</strong></em></p>\n<p>Work for an exciting delivery company that wows customers with their deliveries. Toss and kick the package to the customers door without it letting it touch the ground!</p>\n<p>Music has not been added yet so I recommend playing something in the background.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>There are 2 modes out right now. DELIVERY and PACKAGEBALL.</p>\n<p>To start a game, all players must pick a color (and team if applicable).</p>\n<p>DELIVERY - Get the package to the porch without letting it hit the ground or any hazardous obstacles. The only other rule is that a player is not allowed to hit twice in a row. You have 3 lives, and obstacles increase after each successful delivery.\u00a0See how many deliveries you can complete!</p>\n<p>PACKAGEBALL - \"Volleyball with no rules!\" Hit order doesn't matter here. You can jump over the fence.\u00a0Just get the package to break on the other team's lawn!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0(Keyboard/PS5):</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Alt+F4:\u00a0</strong>Quit the game (button doesn't work yet)</li><li><strong>WASD/Left stick:</strong>\u00a0Move.</li><li><strong>J/Square:\u00a0</strong>Bump. (toss the package straight up)</li><li><strong>K/Triangle:</strong> Volley. (toss the package up and forward)</li><li><strong>Spacebar/Cross:</strong> Jump.</li><li><strong>L/Circle:</strong> Dive. (good for saving the ball, but slow at the end)</li><li><strong>U/R2:</strong> Spike. (strong and slow, hits\u00a0the package downward)</li><li><strong>I/R1:</strong> Kick. (strong and slow,\u00a0hits the package straight forward)</li></ul>\n<p>I am developing another game for my friends to play, but I do intend to keep working on Delivery Paradise! This is a prototype, but here are the <strong>intended features</strong> that will be added later on:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Add quit game button functionality.</li><li>Survival Mode: Set in a box style arena. Players must take turns to keep the package in the air as long as they can while avoiding incoming hazards.</li><li>[Delivery Mode] More types of obstacles.</li><li>[Delivery Mode] Timer.</li><li>[Packageball] Set a score to reach that will end the game.</li><li>[Packageball] Match timer.</li><li>[Packageball] Add game end screen.</li><li>How to play screen.</li><li>Controls screen.</li><li>One loop music track each for the game modes.</li><li>[itch.io] maybe i'll make a trailer/how-to-play for the webpage</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known bugs</strong> (to be fixed later)(feel free to comment some down below):\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>[Delivery Mode]\u00a0Unknown sequence of events causes situation where no one is allowed to hit the package.</li><li>[General] Getting bopped in the head with the package can cause you to get stuck into the ground.
