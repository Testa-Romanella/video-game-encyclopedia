The theme was 'Dreamy' and the limitation was\u00a0<strong>every playthrough is unique</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our playthroughs are unique through the events that occur, the dialogue that's spoken and the puzzles that you do. Is it maybe bending the limitation a bit? Maybe. We pushed hard to add as many interesting events as possible to reduce the chances of getting similar playthroughs, though at the end of the day there's only so much you can do! It's only 72 hours after all! :D<br/><br/>In this game, you'll complete maths, trivia, algebra and ciphers and other various puzzles\u00a0(in the form of paperwork) in order to stave off your annoying boss and to keep yourself awake. You can only stop yourself from hallucinating for so long...<br/><br/>This was made with tons of love, has lots of optional and random dialogue so no two playthroughs will ever be the same, 3 super-events, 2 long-form events, multiple random events and tons narrative exposition to explore and digest.<br/><br/>Have fun!<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:<br/></strong>Mags - Art<br/>Boffin - Programming &amp; Music<br/><br/>You can listen to the background theme here:<br/>https://soundcloud.com/boffin1/performance-review-background-theme</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816b1529f1c26cc296b6b30be8951a9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boffin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
