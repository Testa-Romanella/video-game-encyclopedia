In \u201cVoting In Texas: The Game\u201d Texas Public Radio has developed an interactive experience that drops the player into the world of a character who wants to take part in democracy in the Lone Star State.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a way to put people in the shoes of a potential voter in Texas and experience their odyssey to go vote,\u201d said journalist David Martin Davies who scripted and produced the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The objective of the amusement is to get to the polling station and cast a vote. Along the way, the player discovers that in Texas this isn\u2019t always an easy task to accomplish.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAs journalists we are storytellers and this is just one more way to communicate sourced facts and data about a complex issue. Hopefully this will also reach new audiences and demonstrate\u00a0the barriers of voting in Texas,\u201d said Davies.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is scripted with sourced dialogue using fact-based information about the challenges many in Texas are confronted with when they try to vote. The information communicated in the game is drawn from academic studies and reports from established voting rights organizations.\r\n</p>\n<p>The result is a highly produced walk-through of the pitfalls that many potential voters in Texas face including the difficulty with the state\u2019s voter registration process. In Texas, voter registration isn\u2019t online and must be completed 30 days before Election Day, the maximum that federal law allows. \u00a0In addition there are the issues of closed polling locations, long lines, voter roll purges, voter intimidation, and partisan poll watchers.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cVoting In Texas: The Game\u201d uses the bright colors and snappy sounds of a video game to illustrate the dark fact that the Texas system for voting is the most difficult in the nation.\u00a0 The player even has the opportunity to learn if it\u2019s actually easier to buy a rifle in Texas than it is for a first-time voter to cast a ballot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game only takes a few minutes to play through and is embedded in a web browser. This greatly increases accessibility and portability of the software.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is released as Texas is wrestling with a proposed passage of an even harsher set of voting laws. However, the game play uses the voting laws as they were in place during the\u00a0November 3,\u00a02020 general election.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player even has a chance to relive the experience of deciding to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic when Texas Governor Abbott made wearing a protective face covering optional for the poll workers and the voters.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was developed using the platform RPGMaker MV and the assets available in the product.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95a5e5aab49187f0db4e043e4b9cd3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dmdavies@tpr.org"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
