The dragon landed on a geode while the jewels were still forming and became encased and trapped by them.<br/>As the years passed the energy of the dragon began to fill the floating world with life and pure cooling water began to flow, eventually stone golems came to life to care for the world around the dragon.</p>\n<p>Eventually a legendary wandering master discovered the world and the dragon that was resting there and decided to make this world his home.<br/>The island became a haven for fighters all over the universe and once every 12 years on the year of the dragon the greatest fighters in the universe gather to display their skill in battle to impress the dragon enough to break from its crystalline shell and create worlds once again.<br/>You are a fighter who has arrived the evening before the tournament begins ready for the next day.</p>\n<p>for more information visit my website here https://theartofkelvinavey.weebly.com/greatest-fighters-environment.html </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/5050a28ec27525b1a2c89eaeb27b91b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ka2851"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
