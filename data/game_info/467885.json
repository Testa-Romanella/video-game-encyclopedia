I love GMTK youtube channel and I couldnt let this pass by.</p>\n<p>Well The GMTK Game Jam 2020 gave us the Theme \"Out of Control\". The game I made works around the idea of a random chaotic garden where the fluffy beast (the player) have to survive. Your diet are basically flowers, but to get to them you need to understand your enviroment and the possibilities of it. (behind the scenes some parts of the game punish you if you keep treating the garden as your own and ruling it with your patterns. So yeah! thats some kind of out of control i got in mind. The player can't easily create a perfect farming plot)</p>\n<p>You control a little beeish alien creature with keyboard arrows and use Z and X as your main commands.</p>\n<p>Z - Pickup Sprouts/Plant Sprouts/Eat Flowers</p>\n<p>X - Destroy the plant you're holding/kill Joann</p>\n<p>The player stats match the flowers, except your health thats pink-redish and is healed by white flowers on the Life Tree.</p>\n<p>To play just install and unzip. Inside the zip there is an HOW TO PLAY image file, be sure to read it as it contains vital information.</p>\n<p>Took me one day but I made it playable haha</p>\n\n<p>V.02a - fixed a minor bug on your favorite antisocial neighbor Joann and updated some text.</p><p>V.02 - Created and added\u00a0Sound+Music\u00a0and fixed a\u00a0compile problem( cause I was asleep)</p>\n<p>V.01 - Release</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65cc2c51816abed997e9cb2786b5967b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ochi Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
