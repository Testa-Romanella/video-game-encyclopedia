While latched, you will\u00a0 be stuck on them and you will be undetected. While you are latched, you cannot move but you regenerate control points which allows you to control your character once you disconnect to your host.</p>\n\n<p>WSAD / Arrow keys - to move.<br/>LMB - to shoot projectile / disconnect (while latched)</p>\n\n<p>-Credits-</p>\n<p>Audio - OpenGameArt (TinyWorlds, Longor, pauliuw)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - freesfx.co</p>\n<p>Guard 3d model by Quaternius (https://twitter.com/quaternius) from his free character pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81a/81a60b74de406a59b6bdc8228ce1cd44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["suika343"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
