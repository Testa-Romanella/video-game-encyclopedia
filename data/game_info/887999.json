In the game, you control two separate shooters simultaneously - either of which can take damage. The game is based around the cliched idiom of 'stay in your lane' - which means that each shooter occupies an exclusive half of the screen, and you must improvise to fight enemies who will routinely go across the border.</p>\n<p>[glass angel] features beautiful and abstract backgrounds that were made using hand-painted watercolors and then digitally scanned. It also features an entirely original OST and five unique types of enemies, including a boss fight (currently not finished)! We hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move Ava</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - Move Finch</p>\n<p>Dialogue can be advanced or skipped with any keyboard key or a mouse click.<br/></p>\n<p>Ava and Finch will fire bullets automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Jane Lewis\u00a0</em>- Director, Original Concept, Programming</p>\n<p><em>Valendar</em> - Background Art, Character Designs, Animation, Sprites<br/></p>\n<p><em>VVren</em> - Soundtrack<br/></p>\n<p><em>Quinn</em> - Incidental Music</p>\n<p><strong>Note<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the 2022 Github Game Off.
