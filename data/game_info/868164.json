The cells are arranged in 3x3 grids and the boxes are also arranged in a 3x3 grid.  The numbers must be placed in such a way that no digit is duplicated within a row, column, or box.  Symbol Sudoku takes this idea to another level by replacing the numbers with Greek symbols.<br/><br/>As you solve the puzzles, you can mark the ones you like as favorites and can then generate new custom puzzles based on those favorites for infinite replayability!<br/><br/>The following options can be enabled/disabled:<br/><br/><ul><li> Candidates/pencil marks turn red if they are invalid<br/></li><li> Candidates/pencil marks are removed when a value is placed that invalidates the mark<br/></li><li> Undo/redo moves<br/></li><li> Use alternate symbols (Greek symbols)<br/></li><li> Whether the grid layout starts with 1 in the upper-left or mimics the numpad and starts in the lower-left</li></ul><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> Minimalist design<br/></li><li> Keyboard shortcuts<br/></li><li> Relaxing music<br/></li><li> 5 different difficulty levels<br/></li><li> Comes with 250 puzzles<br/></li><li> Can generate infinite puzzles based on your favorites</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T05:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afe/afe1d1f7b82632b36da5e74c66e89e5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Powerline Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Powerline Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
