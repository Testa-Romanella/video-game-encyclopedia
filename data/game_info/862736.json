Or will you misstep, and spend your nine lives in prison for your failure to administer justice?</p>\n<p>Speed Court is a hectic game of reading comprehension and moral understanding, where two lawyers will attempt to convince you of the merits of the case - If you can hear them over each other. Speed court is not one for courtesies like \"Waiting your turn\" and such nonsense.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this! Balancing it was a nightmare, but after you play your first round, go again! The game will offer you a casual 30 second option as well. We wanted to ensure you all played with the theme first and foremost, but its also nice to be able to experience the full game and see the end. Figured it would be a best of both worlds.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0c/d0c622a4b5e2fd591a605d6abfa03762.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProfugoBarbatus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
