Through this, I learnt how to design high quality models that were low in poly count through the use of normal maps.<br/></p>\n<p>Lost and Found is not meant as a full game, more as a display of my ability in building an world with a fleshed out environment</p>\n<p>The models were created in 3ds Max. Both high and low poly versions of each model were created to then take into Substance Painter. Baking the high poly model onto the low poly model, normal maps were created as well as this gave me the chance to create high resolution materials too.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T13:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01c6275e9d25ca110b31d0a2ece2738b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 380, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harri J"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
