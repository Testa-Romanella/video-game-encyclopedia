However, due to the 48-hour timeframe, we decided to change this concept into a simple 2d platformer and give the player a binary \u201ccruelty or kindness\u201d option.\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Credits: <br/></p>\n<p>Team Name: <strong>CyberMonke</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Producer/Composer: Ewan Cassidy\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Twitter: @EwanMakesGames\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Website: ewancassidy.com\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Devin Colyer\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Twitter: @Papa_Dev_\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Character Artist/Animation: Ailsa Durward\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Twitter: @_AutumnLion\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Instagram: @autumn.lion\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Portfolio:\u00a0ailsadurward\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Background Artist: Lindsay Gavine\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0- Twitter: @OgamesYc\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0-Instagram: @OgamesYc\r\n \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T04:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e19c366fc6840b31f6478f4d1d14e47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAllRoundNerd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
