They were carnivorous, with semi-advanced technology, bipedal, and post-war. Plants were not viewed as a food source but rather highly sought after and respected for their inherently elegant designs and intuition. Plant life could only be grown artificially in vaults and laboratories, as the planet was often barraged with acid rain rendering the soil inert. Plants were cultivated, studied, and pushed to their fullest potential. Root experimentation had received a new breakthrough allowing for direct communication not just between plant species but between plants and electronics as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>This was all cut short one summer when solar flares so intense destabilized the electricity of the planets magnetosphere. Lightning would always join the acid rain in a frenzy. This brought any remaining research stations offline as they were abandoned by their creators, who haphazardly escaped via makeshift rockets. Countless years have passed allowing the planet to undergo a rebirth. It's atmosphere now tamed.\r\n</p>\n<p>You control Bud - One of the first dormant plants to have awakened to the newfound conditions. It is up to you to find a new beginning.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>We are currently finalizing the project! You'll be able to find the finished version of Overgrown here as well as on Steam May 1st. You can also look at our roadmap.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T10:33:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69fb49fe218b4d985dc8c65074dcb2f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fading_lake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
