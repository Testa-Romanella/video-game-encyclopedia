In this version, only the movement mechanics are implemented, as well as a testing grounds for players.<br/></p>\n<p>I will continue to be working on the game to eventually have a full release here and on Steam. The target price is at about $20, but realistically, it would be at around $10 once I'm finish with the main gameplay.

Mostly content involving open world building and story, as well as quests.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about how the completed game will look like and play, please leave a comment down below, I will check the comments at least once a day.</p>\n<p>Step 1 : Extract files to folder of your choosing.\r\n</p>\n<p>Step 2 : Open folder and find Miniass application.\r\n</p>\n<p>Step 3 : Execute Miniass application.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like the prototype and want to see my swinging game completed faster, please donate so I can work less and spend more time on the project.
