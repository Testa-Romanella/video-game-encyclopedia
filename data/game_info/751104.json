Might make more levels in the future if I feel like it, the few I did make were pretty rushed. Overall though, I'm happy enough with the result.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:37:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb4/cb4e53cf269a882cfa189b3e66d1a4d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rtnman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
