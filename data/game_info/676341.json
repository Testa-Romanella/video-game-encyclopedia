Follow the instructions so you don't make even more unstable solutions that increase the level of instability of the lab.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to stabilize as many flasks as possible before they are processed by our cute solution-processor-robot Queue-A \ud83e\udd16. Every unstable solution that is being processed will increase the unstable bar, if this bar gets at 100% your game is over and your score will be saved. Talking about the score, each stabilized solution being processed by Queue-A will give you points depending on the flask type.</p>\n<p>\u2754\ud83d\udd0d How many points can you get before Queue-A detects a point of no return of instability? Comment down below to compare highscores!</p><p>We did this game with much love \u2764\ufe0f during this weekend for the Ludum Dare 49.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game and all the others that are being developed during the Ludum!</p>\n<p>\u26a0\ufe0f<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We don't have a colorblind option sadly so please take this into consideration if you want to try the game.
