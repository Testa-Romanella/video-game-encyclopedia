Click the mouse button to leap across gaps, and see how far you can go. Collect the speed powerup to give you that extra boost. And finally, change the difficulty and see how well you can do - try Froggy Run hard mode for a true challenge!</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Froggy Run is a game that I made for college work, and have decided to release it on itch.io for everyone to play. It is not the best game ever made, so you may encounter some errors, or general gameplay issues, but I hope you enjoy playing nonetheless.</p>\n<p>In the game, you can run endlessly, and use the left mouse button to jump across gaps that you may otherwise fall down. The longer you run, the higher your score will be. You may see a speed powerup when running, pick it up to gain an extra 10 second speed boost, and take your score even higher. You can also change the difficulty, for a tough challenge, or a casual experience. How far can you get?</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>LMB</strong> - jump/menu interaction</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/412a113adcf24b2a025239ffd07cf2b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Blue Yeti Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
