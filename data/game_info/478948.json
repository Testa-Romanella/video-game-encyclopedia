We were struggling, coding till late, making art countless hours (since we aren't artists, just honest programmers), but in the end we had so much fun and gained a lot of experience working in a very small team.</p>\n<p>Since we've made more of a game engine to create games inside unity, instead of a simple game, the level design is quite lacking and sometimes inadequate to the main setting of \"bank heist\". Although with the code power we have now, you could do much more sophisticated levels just by dragging components.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:55:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c37b9ea9540b6aa6714969f13630f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Walrus", "Stfoorca"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
