After arriving on an island off the coast of Cornwall to work as Engineer, you\u2019re quickly put to work in the lithium mines due to the flexibility clause in your contract. With the Cornwall Mining Corporation demanding a \u00a33,000 fee to terminate your employment contract and take you back to the mainland, you\u2019re left with nothing to do but dig.</p>\n<p><strong>SOCIAL LINKS</strong></p>\n<p>Steam |\u00a0Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Discord\u00a0| Kickstarter</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS - Patch 0.0.1</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Common: On loading a save, game will flash some text briefly.\u00a0</li><li>Common: On running out of energy, and respawning in bed, the game will flash some text briefly.\u00a0</li><li>Common; Main menu settings for windowed mode may have to be pressed twice to get the desired result.\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0Very Rare: After loading a save, main menu may get stuck.
