Players control \u201cBig Sam\u201d Freedom Nixon as they traverse a facility located in northern Siberia to finish their mission- finding and destructing \u201ca weapon more powerful than the Tsar Bomba\u201d , which has been discovered by the CIA. The player must traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits. The player can deal with this in many ways- enemies can be avoided or defeated using weapons at Sam\u2019s disposal- a rifle and a grenade launcher, which can be used only when possessing grenades.</em></p>\n<p><em>Though the game itself is, at least in external design, quite simple, rumours of the game\u2019s hidden complexities have been circulating in the past. One of the more popular rumours was that of the game in question adapting itself to every new player, being tailor-made for every person. </em><br/><em>The truth was stranger. It appears that Nobody: Interactive was a puppet studio which ceased to exit after the game was released. It appears as the actual people behind the game were the CIA. Though the game was supposed to be propaganda under the codename \"Project Polybius\", it was never noted at such due to its very limited success.\" -\u00a0Amepedia article about the history of\u00a0Duty of the Union: The Call</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - Move</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Z - Shoot</p>\n<p>X - Grenades</p>\n<p>A - Enter Doors</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>No, this isn't actually a rom of a 40 year old game, this is merely a framing device</p>\n<p>This game is made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/556/5566ccf2465606df20cb4c7108916e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nobody: Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
