We have defined it as \u201cFire and fly\u201d style.<br/></p>\n<p>Game for:\u00a0Commodore 64 / TheC64 mini / TheC64 Maxi</p>\n\n<p><strong>ARGUMENT</strong></p>\n<p>Dragonaker, our dragon, wants to go home, but what seemed like a pleasant walk turns into a great adventure. Mines, dragons, rain clouds, electric clouds, winged beings, etc. prevent the way. We will have to break through with the power of the shot of its jaws to finally face our great enemy, the great green dragon. But be careful! Not all clouds are white and vaporous and can be traversed. There are also thick gray clouds that we will not be able to pass, just the ones that Dragonaker does not feel good at all. So it is best to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PHASES</strong></p>\n<p>The game has five phases, four of them with their final boss and for all this we will have only 5 lives to complete Dragonaker.</p>\n<p>Phase 1: Cloud zone 1<br/>Phase 2: Cloud Zones 2<br/>Phase 3: Fog zone<br/>Phase 4: Training zone<br/>Phase 5: Cloud zone 3</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>ADITIONAL INFORMATION</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is developed with seuck, a maker that facilitates the creation of games but at the same time limits the options. However, to overcome these limitations and create it with that classic and functional aspect, we have implemented improvements to it to achieve what we wanted.</p>\n<p>Originally published from : www.commodorespain.es</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>This game is prepared to play on a Commodore 64. using a Tapauino device.\u00a0It can also be played on the C664 mini or maxi, or using compatible hardware such as emulation (Vice, CCS64, C64 forever, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0Download the file and run the .tap file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:10:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c066512d84332cc3e8a2c9846d524da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Commodore Spain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
