The Atra Nube flew away as quickly as it came, but not without leaving a parting gift...<br/></p>\n<p>A strike of lightning was cast, which struck an unsuspecting paint factory in Midwestern America.\r\n</p>\n<p>An overnight worker realized that some of the paint struck had gained magical abilities. It allowed him to jump higher and sustain more damage. He decided to hide the paint in his home gallery so that its powers wouldn't be abused.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Atra Nube eventually returned and swallowed the world in darkness. It's now up to our painter to use his magical paint to defeat the darkness. Unfortunately the paint is hidden in the creations of his gallery. Our hero must jump into the frames of his paintings to collect enough paint to overcome the Atra Nube and escape from its darkness.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Click the left mouse button to throw paint, and WASD to move around.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:36:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf684a556e8da05f57fcfa92a29ba5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JKupoluyi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
