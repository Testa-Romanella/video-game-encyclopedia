Match three or more of the blocks in any direction to clear them. When cleared, any block above the line will fall down, allowing for new matches. Set up these cascading line-clears to earn extra points.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter certain amounts of line-clears, you will advance in level, causing the falling speed to increase.
