Players will encounter a series of interesting hidden items, hazy riddles, and unpickable locks. Messages detailing the lives of those who crewed the ship can also be found along the way. Realistic visions portray the events leading up to the attack on the ship. There is a magical story to be told and a swashbuckling adventure to be had. Can you survive the kraken and escape?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player navigates the ship in either first or third person by walking around. Various items can be inspected for a closer look. An inventory is available for picking up items and bringing them with you. Clues, riddles, and hints all lead to certain items and particular actions needed to complete the puzzles. Completing puzzles leads to more escape rooms. There are currently two pirate themed escape rooms and additional escape rooms are likely to be added in the future as the game is updated.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T02:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/03678cd26f30158c72468d915437789e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicholas Vandermeulen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nicholas Vandermeulen"], "esrb_rating": null}
