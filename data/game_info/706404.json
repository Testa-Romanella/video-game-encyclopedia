Open Blender</p>\n<p>2. Open \" Polkadot_Genrator.blend \" File using Blender 2.93 or later.<br/><br/>3. Switch to \" Shading \"\u00a0 workspace\u00a0tab at the top (must be in blender 2.8+).<br/><br/>4. You should now see two windows a preview plane at top and nodes at bottom:<br/><br/><br/>Mapping Node:</p>\n<p>Use the Mapping Node's Location, Rotation, and Scale to adjust how PolkaDots are displayed on the visual plane as desired.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Voronoi Texture Node:</p>\n<p>Use the Voronoi Texture Node to further modify the size and randomness of dots.</p>\n\n\n<p>ColorRamp Node:</p>\n<p>Use the ColorRamp Node to change the color and shift the hue throughout. You can use the + and - to add or remove more if needed.</p>\n\n\n<p>RGB Curves Node:</p>\n<p>Use the RGB Curves Node to facilitate the hue shifting further for more fine-tuned control over the coloring.</p>\n\n<p><em>NOTE: You can replace the RGB Curves and ColorRamp with an RGB Mix Node if needed, however, the modification of colors will become somewhat limited with less control over the dots and background.</em><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:47:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea0e0b3a899873b4d5160d30bed65016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SkywolfGameStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
