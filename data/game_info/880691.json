The account was deleted due to frustration with game development, bad luck getting noticed and general inexperience.</p>\n<p>This part of the SupremeNerd archives focuses on fangames, mostly FNaF. Despite my dissapointment with the franchise in general, I still enjoy the first game's ideas and some of the quality fangames.</p>\n<p><strong><em>EPILEPSY WARNING: ALL OF THESE GAMES CONTAIN FLASHING LIGHTS.</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>1. Me + My Friends</strong></p>\n<p>A point-and-click game based on the pilot episode of \"<em>The Backyardigans</em>\", which I never saw (<em>check special thanks section below for an explanation</em>). You explore a decrepit building using an elevator while avoiding some humanoid monsters, The goal is to find the Backyardigans suits. Each one will take you to a specific minigame that you have to complete. I highly recommend reading the \"how to play\" sections as some mechanics are not explained during gameplay.</p>\n<p><strong>2. RE_location</strong></p>\n<p>A demo for a FNaF fangame made while trying to learn Clickteam. It's just 1 night an only contains 2 active enemies. There's some cutscenes and a minigame but I totally forgot what the lore for this thing was.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>3. Seven Nights With Pinchface</strong></p>\n<p>Another FNaF fangame, this time with characters from Nickelodeon bumpers as antagonist. This one is fully complete, containing 7 nights as the title states.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special thanks:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>obscuritySTA</em> : original ideas for <em>Me + My Friends &amp; Seven Nights With Pinchface</em><br/>\n</li><li><em>adventurefoxy389</em> : voice actor for the <em>Me + My Friends</em> intro and game over screen.</li></ul>\n<p>I actually tried to to a game with FNaF's \"sit-n-survive\" formula recently, but making it original enough to not be considered a fangame:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cf618ab5d43b7750a7c6824213bc7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ApeHardware"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
