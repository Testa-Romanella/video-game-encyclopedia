This idea is expressed through a Windows based game titled \"Inequality\" where the player chooses to control a character from a subculture.</p><br/>The game aims to show how people that are part of a subculture are negatively viewed by people that are not part of or unfamiliar to that subculture and will attempt to change the player's view on people in subcultures. It will be used to try and help players understand how alone people in certain subcultures can feel when they are around \"Normal People\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c833b9f8e7eddcb0a04a42d307ce28c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adrian White"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
