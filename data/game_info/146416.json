Since then, I have added functionality for multiple levels and also made a few fixes.</p><p>This game was made with Allegro 5 (C++)</p><p>Assets taken from the Kenney asset pack (purchased 2016 CC0 licence).</p><p>You play the part of Figgy, who's gone on a treasure hunting adventure (I called him Figgy, cos he looks a bit like a fig... original eh?).</p><p>Navigate the levels looking for the key to open the door, collecting coins as you go.</p><p>You can jump and run about to navigate the levels, but be careful falling as this can hurt if you fall too far!</p><p>You have five minutes to leave each level</p><p>Bouncing about too much can stun Figgy, if this happens, let go of the keys, this will allow movement again.</p><p><strong>Known bugs/issues:</strong></p><p>1. collisions can be a bit iffy at times, though this doesn't break the game (this includes lifts and being slightly stuck on walls/the floor,), also, occasionally Figgy will fall through a platform (Normally the end sections). I'm working on a fix for this.</p><p>2. Some of the sounds need slight refinement (If the music does your head in, you can turn it off in the options menu :D ).</p><p><strong>Current features Beta 1:</strong></p><p>1. Two full levels</p><p>2. bronze, silver and gold coins to pick up</p><p><strong>Planned features:</strong><br/></p><p>1. Enemies (two different types so far)</p><p>2. Floor traps (spikes so far)</p><p>3. Two more levels (more will be added if I get enough interest)</p><p>4. Pickup sounds</p><p>5. Falling sound</p><p>6. Bonus pickups (extra lives so far)</p><p>7. A savable Hi Score table</p><p>8. I may add controller support (let me know if you want it)</p><p>Thanks and I really hope you enjoy playing this game. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any suggestions or (constructive) comments.</p><p>Phil.
