All while avoiding hazards, staying under par and driving their enemies straight to the fiery pits of Hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like the 80s cartoons that inspired us, our story is too big to fit within the confines of traditional linear storytelling. Trilinear storytelling maybe, but it probably still wouldn\u2019t work. All you need to know is that the universe itself is at stake. <br/><br/><br/><br/>These heroes will need to use teamwork like a team to complete challenges across space and time.<br/><br/>Introducing:<br/><br/><ul><li>Tu Putt the Brute \u2014 Strength, Durability<br/></li><li>Haeroneth Farwood \u2014 Accuracy, Mysticism<br/></li><li>1st Lieutenant Commander Captain \"Birdy\" Flicker \u2014 Teleportation, Speed<br/></li><li>Chip Rampage \u2014 Tracking, Balanced</li></ul><br/>Every character plays differently and can receive an edge by being customized with a unique inventory of special balls, clothing and clubs.<br/><br/><br/>Each mission has a unique location in both space and time. Travel from the primordial ooze that first birthed man to the farthest reaches of a futuristic moonbase, this universe includes: <br/><br/><ul><li>The Holo-deck-o-gram<br/></li><li>The wasteland<br/></li><li>Moon Base Iv Alpha<br/></li><li>Jurassic Putt<br/></li><li>The Hidden Elvish Castle<br/></li><li>Viking-ville</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>When they aren\u2019t saving the universe, our heroes chill at 90,000 feet in the HQ\u2019s Game Room. Collect cartridges scatters throughout the levels to unlock mini games in the console. Play pinball to add coin to your stash and spend that coin on the slot machine to unlock unique items to aid in your quest. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Traditional level unlocking plus boss battles and survival modes are featured. Asynchronous multiplayer is planned for a future release allowing you to play against the best players across the world or challenge your friends to best your score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78c/78c823edf6f5dbd0732e1e0feaf6dd4e.jpg", "website": "http://ponywolf.com/timegolfsquad/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ponywolf"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ponywolf"], "esrb_rating": null}
