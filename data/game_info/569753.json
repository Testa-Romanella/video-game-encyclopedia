At times we don\u2019t know what to do, but quitting is not an option. We are persecuted by others, but God has not forsaken us. We may be knocked down, but not out. 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 TPT</p>\n<p>There are many storms that pass through in our life some small and light, but others heavy and ferocious. Some people fly over the storm others have to walk through.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lost in the Storm is a Single-player adventure game with a little bit of a mystery element in between. You're playing a character named Andrew. A man who is currently very lost in his life, who can't seem to remember why. Or doesn\u2019t what to remember at all. Through the game, you see more and more of Andrew's memories bringing back feeling of guilt, pain, and fears that he is still trying to run from. Soon, he will have to face it all and come to terms with what happened in the past to get out of the storm. Or else, he will remain lost in the storm forever.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:08:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faa0f759b8f3e7a2fa35bc997c1e6ebc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nexsle"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
