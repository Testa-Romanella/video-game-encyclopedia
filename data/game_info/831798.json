I only posted this for my friends, but you can check it out. Future game elements will be added, such as randomly no clipping into a different level or multiple exits. This game will be about exploring all the different levels, there isnt just 1 path, but many.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T19:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7c434702702764cbc344092eddb17c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UniverseStarAsh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
