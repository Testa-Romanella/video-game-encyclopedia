{"id": 263124, "slug": "lilac", "name": "Lilac", "name_original": "Lilac", "description": "<p>Lilac is a prototype for what will likely be a very similar game. At the moment, this game has one level, and it's certainly a bit rough around the edges. However, the mechanics are certainly on display and the potential is evident. The idea behind Lilac is that you're an art curator invited to explore the first ever entire art museum designed (and supplied with its art) by an artificial intelligence called LILAC I. The way that LILAC I communicates to you is through the sculptures and paintings on display, as well as the many small word puzzles that get you from room to room.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The term \"letter\" and \"button\" are used fairly interchangeably; be aware that they pretty much refer to the same thing in this game.</p>\n<p>Approach puzzles and interact with them (left click) to enter focus on them. This will orient the camera to the puzzle and prepare your inventory, if you have one.</p>\n<p>Each puzzle is looking for one or more specific words. These words are visible in the HUD when you enter puzzle focus. Words that you find will be indicated on the HUD as well.</p>\n<p>There are rules for how you can type a solution:</p>\n<ul><li>You may start at any letter</li><li>You may only move to adjacent (up, down, left, right) letters</li><li>Each button can only be pressed once in a solution</li></ul>\n<p>There is no limit to the number of guesses you can make at any given puzzle. You interact with (left click)\u00a0the green button below the puzzle to submit a solution; if your submission was incorrect, the puzzle will reset and you may try again.</p>\n<p>There are three ways to exit puzzle focus if you're done with it or want to go search for detachable letters:</p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD to move</li><li>Click somewhere off of the puzzle, i.e. the wall</li><li>Interact with (left click) the red button below the puzzle</li></ul>\n<p>Tablets serve as your inventory in Lilac. These lie on the walls of the entrances to exhibits. Exhibits close behind you when you pick up their corresponding tablet. Returning the tablet to its mount (left click) will reopen the door. Picking up the tablet (left click) enables you to store detachable buttons.</p>\n<p>Most buttons are grey. These can be pressed, but not removed. Black buttons are actually holes in the keypad. Orange buttons are detachable (drag with right click), and can be swapped with other orange buttons or plugged into holes.\u00a0 Once you use a detachable button in a\u00a0<em>correct</em> submission to a puzzle, it is\u00a0permanently part of that keypad (it becomes grey).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't want to spoil all the fun, so I'll leave a few things ambiguous c:</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move, exit puzzle</li><li>Mouse to look</li><li>Left Click - Interact, Push buttons</li><li>Right Click - Drag detachable letters</li><li>Space - Jump (not really necessary, but kinda fun sometimes)</li><li>Q - Enter puzzle focus on tablet</li></ul>\n\r\nBugs\r\n<p>I fixed all the major bugs I found; however, since this prototype was made in about two months and went through many major design changes, there are certainly lingering issues. Please feel free to leave comments about any issues you may be having with the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dde/ddecfd202b5fb4fe2e01e1ec15cd101e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Jack Davis"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
