However what I can tell is that I plan to add some sort of world domination/conquest with armies and such (heavily based Legion Saga series - if you haven't played, you should. amazing game series).</p>\n<p>Fair warning: I suck at balancing the difficulty of the game so, it may be too easy or too hard sometimes, please bear with me, I'm learning.</p>\n<p>If you have any tips, suggestions, bugs to report send me a message here or at contato@juckzgames.com.br<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffe8791fe1d98e8c9626d017b4152104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JuckzGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
