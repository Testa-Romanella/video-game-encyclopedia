I'm Fishy, 1st year in highschool, and it took me 5 months to make this project. I'm pretty sure\u00a0there are no bugs yet, but, if you\u00a0<em>do\u00a0</em>ever find one, it would be very nice if you read the \"Reports\" section</p>\n<p>2- Instructions:</p>\n<p>To use the program, open the .bat file, and you're good to go.</p>\n<p>As far as controls go, every face moves clockwise, for now... (<em><strong>evil laughter</strong></em>)</p>\n<p>[Q]: Yellow Face</p>\n<p>[W]: White Face</p>\n<p>[E]: Blue Face</p>\n<p>[D]: Green Face</p>\n<p>[A]: Red Face</p>\n<p>[S]: Orange Face</p>\n<p>[R]: Undo</p>\n<p>[ESC]: Close the Program</p>\n<p>[F11]: Full-Screen</p>\n<p>[SPACEBAR]: Shuffle the Cube (Only if it's Solved)</p>\n<p>3- Reports:</p>\n<p>So you've found a bug. Better if I splat it, right? Well, here's how you let me know:</p>\n<p>a) First you got to take screenshots of the cube. The best angles are the corners, so picture every corner and that's it. (You'll obviously need to save said screenshots as files for later use.)</p>\n<p>b) Close the game with the escape key</p>\n<p>c) There will be two log files next to the .bat file. Just copy them inside a folder with the screenshots.</p>\n<p>d) Zip everything (.rar is fine too) and send it to my discord (FishyBusinessYT#2339), along with a description of what went wrong.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions or petitions regarding the program may also be sent there, no problem.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and have a great time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5ce0c0ae1bb5930fc0f428b9eb62a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FishyBusinessYT"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
