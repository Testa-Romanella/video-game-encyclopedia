It is true that this game's development was inspired by the game Vampire Survivors.<br/><br/>We wanted to see if we could make something similar, but different - to see if we could capture some of the fun elements of that game and then expand on them and see what kinds of challenges and/or obstacles such a project would create,  and then overcome them.<br/><br/>This game is not intended to be a copy, a rip-off, a reskin, or an attempt to trick people into buying this game instead of the other one. We have dedicated real time, energy, resources,  and money into making this the best game we could make,  and trying to come up with our own version.<br/><br/>That being said, it is understandable and inevitable that we will be compared to that other game.<br/><br/>We only hope that this comparison can be seen as the flattery that it is intended and not something nefarious.<br/><br/>If you like this game, please consider supporting Vampire Survivors as well - and tell 'em Axol Studio says 'hi' \ud83d\ude09", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T03:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/0226559f3a62b652e92faa0b7cb33159.jpg", "website": "https://axolstudio.com/projects/bring_it_on/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axol Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Axol Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
