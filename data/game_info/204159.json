{"id": 204159, "slug": "super-duper-punch", "name": "Super Duper Punch", "name_original": "Super Duper Punch", "description": "<p>SuperDuperPunch is a vintage arcade-style boxing game that is reminiscent of games like Activision\u2019s Boxing for Atari 2600, Punch-Out, or SuperSmashBros. The outstanding gameplay and distinct design aspects made SDP an exhilarating experience for mobile devices. Fight for glory in arcade mode or also play against a friend on the same device in 2 player mode!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Super Duper Punch was born because of our love of retro video game design aesthetics and 8-bit/16-bit abstract gameplay. We were thinking of making something that could have come out on the early Atari consoles, or Commodore 64, but with a pinch of our twist and taste.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a certain simplicity that\u2019s missing from many of today\u2019s games, and we want to bring that back without sacrificing design or gameplay; we have bright, blocky graphics, and intuitive controls that anyone can pick-up and play.</p>\n<p>Super Duper Punch is reminiscent of games like Activision\u2019s Boxing for the 2600, or Punch-Out, but combined with soccer, and given a pixelated psychedelic makeover.</p>\n\n<p>Two combatants slug it out in a top-down arena, as various power-ups appear on the field. The objective of the game is to force one\u2019s opponent into one of the goal posts on either end of the playing field. Each punch knocks the other character back a little, unless they block the punch. Simple to explain, but challenging to master. Super Duper Punch offers a great multiplayer experience too, even on mobile devices, as two players go head-to-head in an all-out slugfest.<br/></p>\n<p>Super Duper Punch has a roster of ten fighters, with more to unlock. Finalizing the characters and stages took about six rounds of completely starting over before we felt that the game embodied our brand and vision.<br/></p>\n<p>When designing, we love combining things that might not normally go together. Like what would happen if you have a character made out of the combination of a peanut, an angel, and a ballet dancer? That\u2019s how Clara was born. It\u2019s almost like looking at clouds and seeing familiar shapes and pictures in them. We combined all kinds of elements in the clouds of our imagination to come up with these characters.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The sound design for Super Duper Punch started as an experiment in trial and error. The thing that we were sure of from the beginning was that we didn\u2019t want to use 8-bit music, as everybody uses this kind of music in their video games these days. We tried many styles, from classical to jazz, to techno, to whatever you think. After we finally decided on the style, we asked a musician friend to jump in, and he took it to the next level.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>We believe that all the elements in Super Duper Punch work together to make the experience perfect. We had many other ideas for this game, but thought that adding them would make the game unnecessarily complex, and would not be as much fun for the player. In the world of mobile games, Super Duper Punch stands out because of its visual style, as well as the innovative approach to gameplay, which is unlike anything else out there.\u00a0Super Duper Punch will have a surprise that you have to play to the end to see. You will be shocked when you see the final stage!<br/><br/>And this is not just the style for this game, but the style of our entire lives. As we mentioned before we are fascinated with simple Atari/Commodore design, not only for games but designing life! Our interest in design and culture, combined with the resultant simplicity of 80s video games which were constrained by technical limitations, made our super duper design possible.</p>\n<p><strong>The Story:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Queen Clara has been a boxing champion for many years but unfortunately she is deceived by her ego which leads to her being de-crowned. Now, in order to reclaim her crown from her evil ego she has to fight and beat ten opponents each of which holds a part of her evil ego. Upon defeating all 10 she will have the opportunity to face her ego for the finale and to reclaim her crown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/797c238b8ebd8d8bae167869643b49bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amir Alavi"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
