{"id": 505596, "slug": "ark-rip", "name": "Ark Rip", "name_original": "Ark Rip", "description": "<p>Ark Rip is a Breakout-style arcade game that adds in elements from incremental games.</p>\n<p>There are 14 unique types of pinballs, like Poison, Juggernaut, and Chain Lightning,\u00a0that you can combine and upgrade in any way you want. Some change the pinball behavior, some do different types of damage. It's up to you to find combinations that work well together.<br/>There are boss battles, powerups, several stages, and more.</p>\n<p>Plans for development:<br/>Skill system, to reinforce the incremental aspects of the game.<br/>More block types, and more bosses.<br/>Graphical improvements.<br/>Sound effects.<br/>Quality of life improvements, like tooltips and descriptions.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The imbedded player has a fair amount of mouse input lag that I cannot eliminate. It is for this reason that I recommend you play the downloadable version if you are on Windows.</p>\n<p>Discord For Feedback and Chat:\u00a0https://discord.gg/xzHeA68</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:35:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bd/8bda77df5bedcd9d7a02aa25585dc21c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Firazoid"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
