The graphics are simple with the intentions of making the game run on any windows machine. The game is played by dodging a series of objects by either sliding with the \"S\" key, or jumping with the spacebar. While mid-air or lying on the ground, you can move yourself side by side by using the normal movement keys, bound to \"A\" &amp; \"D\" by default. For every object your pass, you'll be rewarded with one point of score.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b62448f599358c6b77818ec86a052ed5.jpeg", "website": "http://www.arthurham.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wreck", "Arthur Ham", "greenfigure"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Arthur Ham", "Wreck"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
