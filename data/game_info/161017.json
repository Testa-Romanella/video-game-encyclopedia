Add this to the fact that one loss means you have to start the whole game over, and this becomes probably one of the hardest Arkanoid-clones ever, even though there's only 5 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts can be found here:</strong></p>\n<p>http://www.dafont.com/capture-it.font</p>\n<p>http://www.dafont.com/top-secret-kb.font</p>\n<p>http://www.dafont.com/gunplay.font</p>\n<p><strong>Music is courtesy of Over Clocked Remix- This artist and track, specifically:</strong></p>\n<p>https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00008</p>\n<p>(it's a remix of a song from Arkanoid.
