Countless slimes journey far and wide for a chance to be immortalized as true champions of technique to all slimekind!<br/><br/><strong>Super Slime Arena</strong> is a multiplayer party fighting game embracing equal parts accessibility and chaos. Every slime has a unique attack and every attack is a one-hit-KO. Every time your slime gets KO'd, you respawn as a different character. True mastery demands understanding of 32 slimes with unique qualities, and learning how their abilities interact in over a thousand possible match-ups!<br/><br/>Play on 13 unique stages in 5 different game modes. Dive in to the chaotic action of Shuffle mode, or carefully consider each matchup while picking and counter-picking slimes for Elimination mode. Explore the wilds of the Rainbow Jungle, ricochet off walls in Lucky Neko Pinball, or fight between high-speed trains at Country Slime Station. Enjoy handmade 16-bit pixel art backgrounds and an original retro-inspired soundtrack from over a dozen different artists! <br/><br/>Fight with all of your friends, and all of your controllers! Enter the arena using nearly any controller from retro to modern, fight sticks or flight sticks, plastic guitars and bongos!
