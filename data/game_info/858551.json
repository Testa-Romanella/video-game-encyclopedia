It was made in about a week for a game jam,\u00a0using the Godot game engine since it was easy to get a good grasp of. I'm looking forward to\u00a0feedback and advice!\u00a0I'm sure there will be some bugs or oversights that still\u00a0need fixing. You might experience\u00a0audio crackling depending on your browser, and I'm still trying to figure out what is causing it. It only happens when I run the game on a browser,\u00a0and\u00a0it looks like it might\u00a0be an issue with the Godot engine itself.<br/></p><p>PC Version:\u00a0https://bennyc4.itch.io/ultra-drive</p>\n<p>There are five levels in total, with the last being a boss stage. Once you get a high enough score in each level, you can move on to the next stage. There are many unique enemy types, as well as\u00a0health items and powerups that can be dropped from them. Each level has great background art and music made by\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/, go check him out, he makes some cool stuff! I hope you enjoy the game,\u00a0and thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>(Credits to\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/\u00a0for the art assets and music, as well as\u00a0https://gamesupply.itch.io/\u00a0for the sound effects.)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T12:18:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1df/1dfa5c42fce4c8a75cd8ef8d955f4f1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Christian Bennett"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
