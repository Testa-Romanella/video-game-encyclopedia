Balls of Steel. The title was developed in the Unity Engine and took around 4 months. \u00a0So to say from zero knowledge how to use Unity until this version.</p><p>Basically this game consists of Platform-, Skill- and Puzzle-Elements combining everything into a final score for comparing and battleling with your friends. If you'd like to know more about the way the game was created it, just let me know.</p>If you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know. If you have any ideas for a cooperation project, just let me know. I'm open for new and interesting projects at any time, especially if you're interested in solving Engineering Problems with a game engine like Unity. ;-)<br/><p>Now let's start with the important facts.<br/></p>\r\nRules:\r\n<ol><li>You have an infinite amount of lifes.</li><li>The more lifes you need the less will be your final score.</li><li>Collect the blinky cubes to raise the score.</li><li>Push the bluish objects into the black space to raise the score.</li><li>The less distance you travel, the more final score you will get.</li><li>Be ready for suprises.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>CAUTION: </strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Take care of the towers!</li><li>In Cube-Shape towers can not hurt you, since <strong>Cube-Shape is super massive</strong>.</li><li> Game is finally over when no health points are left or if you reached the level's end.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Feel free the adjust the acceleration slider to the value you need.
