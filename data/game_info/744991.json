The idea is to surprise the player, but I'd like everyone to \"get\" it.</p>\n<p>When the player gets a high enough score, an outer ring will appear. It usually rotates\u00a0\u00a0 counter clockwise, but on certain scores it'll rotate clockwise. Get three of these in a row, and the game will zoom into itself, and the player will be presented with the \"Hello\" text. From then on the game is a text adventure.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The idea is to elicit a series of \"WHAT\"'s from the player, over the course of a 10 minute adventure.</p>\n<p>Above is a playable proof of concept.\u00a0 There's no audio in the build above.</p>\n<p>There's also a video of a full playthrough.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:52:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1f/d1fb52ebb13a95aeb9e9d1d965ca22a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dziek"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
