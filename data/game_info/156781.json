In this game couple of lights blink on the screen and player interacts with those lights by tapping them in the same sequence, in which they blinked before. Lighting up each object will increase the score. Faster the tapping speed, more the score will increase. </p><p>By increasing level, number of objects also increase and so does the level of difficulty. When number of objects increase from five, it becomes much difficult to remember things. Player has two options to use: \"Hints\" or \"blink again\". In hints, one next light will blink again. And by pressing blink again icon, complete or remaining sequence will blink again.</p><p>FOLLOW US:</p><ul><li>Facebook</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Google+</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f8/4f83c8f62a4fe2f124f8a9bbe41e6a54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spysol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
