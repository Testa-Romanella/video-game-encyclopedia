Gather what resources you can, kill enemies, find artifacts, and try to survive as long as possible!</p>\n<p>Your teleporter is broken, and will warp you every 10 seconds between your base, the mine, and a hostile zone. In the mines, destroy rocks to collect ore. In the hostile zone, kill enemies to collect resources and rare artifact drops. In your base, heal up and spend resources and ore to activate collected artifacts. The difficulty ramps up the more you teleport!</p>\n<p>Controls (Keyboard/Gamepad): WASD/Left Stick to Move, Arrows/Right Stick to Shoot, Space/Back to Teleport Early, E/A to Buy Artifacts, Ctrl/Left Trigger to Hide the HUD, Enter/Start to Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T08:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ff/9fffe4efbda0905c4e60189ac10af276.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glenugie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
