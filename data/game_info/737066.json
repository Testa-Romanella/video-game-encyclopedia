Waves of enemies will arrive such as the winged minion kaiju (so it's not really a kaiju) that chases you but goes away when you have the shield, a thorny health pack which if you hit using the shield from below, you can get it's health, a laser minion kaiju (also not really a kaiju) and the long necked (real) kaiju. For you to win, just attack as much winged minion kaiju until the long necked kaiju comes then attack him 3 times to win. You also can do triple jumps when you throw your shield.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left and Right Arrow Keys to Move, Down to Throw the Shield and to Triple Jump when not Holding It</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Miyaki: Programmer, Artist, SFX Artist</p>\n<p>Takago: Music Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:37:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/507/5078f7c4364094aecea98c52ac47fc65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
