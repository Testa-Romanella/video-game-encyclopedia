This \n      collection of games was available on portable LCD devices, and each \n      title featured a game and a clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two \n      modes of play: GAME A (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced \n      play). While some controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to \n      better suit the Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself \n      has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Move the chef to catch and flip the falling ingredients before they can \n      hit the floor! Contend with three ingredients in GAME A and four in GAME \n      B. Earn one point for every ingredient the chef successfully flips into \n      the air, or a mistake icon each time you drop an ingredient. Receive \n      three mistake icons, and it\u2019s game over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/821/821b77bef3d93cadc3990386a125a3e7.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/gameandwatch/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
