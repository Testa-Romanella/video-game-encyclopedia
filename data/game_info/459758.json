They long for the touch of one another but can not embrace due to the TWO beam swords on SaberQueen's arms. Together they fight for love in the unforgiving expanse of space! The game is themed around the love between these TWO hearts and their ability to over come any obstacle by working together.\u00a0 Try to get as many points as possible before you defeat enough enemies to move on to the next level!</p>\n<p>There are 5 levels that can be done in a linear progression or the player can choose an endless mode where 1 of the levels will be loaded in at random. The player can only use the beam attack while the TWO lovers can see each other, and should SaberQueen come in contact with BlastLad, the player will get a game over!</p>\n\n<p>Assets used On interwebs</p>\n<p>Beam sound https://freesound.org/people/thehorriblejoke/sounds/351499/</p>\n<p>Enemy Pathfinding https://arongranberg.com/astar/</p>\n<p>Magic Sound https://freesound.org/people/JomelleJager/sounds/252681/</p><p>Animated Tile Script From Unity2D Extras\u00a0 https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-extras</p>\n<p>Assests created before the jam:<br/></p>\n<p>Assets - All of the Wall Sprites for levels</p>\n<p>Assets- MatchWidth script\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab97a2df46c52231521736456585e87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlastLad"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
