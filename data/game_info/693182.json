Ending up going with a synthwave-esque color scheme/terrain shape, and made a short synth-based OST to go with it.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move around, mouse to look around, left click to shoot, and can use scroll wheel to adjust mouse sensitivity. No end objectives besides attempting not to get overwhelmed by the waves of enemies.</p>\n<p>If playing in browser please use full screen.</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd0bfe556098cc189c607ae828426dfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SodiumNickel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
