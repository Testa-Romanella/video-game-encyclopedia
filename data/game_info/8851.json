Clear the marbles by making groups of the same color. Groups of three or more marbles of the same color will fall down. If the marbles cross the glowing line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>Simply tap a marble on the game board, or an empty spot close to it, to fire a marble towards that spot. To fine tune your shot, slide your finger left and right anywhere on the screen to first set the direction, then release your finger to launch the marble. <br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>* FAIRY TREASURE - NEW GAME! *<br/>Make sure to check out our latest game Fairy Treasure - Amazing brick-busting game with tons of new fun bricks and amazing power ups never seen before! <br/>_____________________________________<br/><br/>WE WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK!<br/>Your reviews/ratings are very important to us, and they\u2019ll help us bring you free updates with more great features and exciting new games! <br/><br/>Please contact us through the support link below if you experience any problems, or if you would like to share your ideas with us on how to further improve the game.<br/><br/>Game On! :)<br/><br/>Developed and published by GameOn<br/>http://www.gameonarcade.com", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1fd9c5c430f2e351f81146fac6e253.jpeg", "website": "http://www.GameOnArcade.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["GOES International"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["GOES International"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
