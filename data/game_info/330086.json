It will be possible to upgrade the equipment by using specific objects, and to use different weapons and spells buffs.<br/>The enemies have an elementary AI (Artificial Intelligence) but functional for the various fights and bossfights present in the game.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:59:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c9547fac41319fcaebf61ec8e19c0545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rattingham Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
