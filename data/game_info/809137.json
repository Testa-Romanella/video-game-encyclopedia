As an overworked\u00a0guard of Dorchester Castle in the late 16th century, you awaken from a perfectly reasonable nap to find the castle's occupants changed into living furniture. Explore and fight your way to the boss door to escape this neon Gothic nightmare!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This Unreal Engine 4 prototype was developed over four weeks for the GAM-305 Digital Game Development class at SNHU. The five of us in\u00a0Blue Team chose a top-down perspective for our final and went in the direction of a hack 'n' slash medieval fantasy roguelite. We hope you enjoy it, and please let us know what you think! <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T06:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcb70db4469c8fac6f63e9ac416b395a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Didi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
