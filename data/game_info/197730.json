Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a <em><strong>REAL</strong> </em>naval war?<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you answered yes to one, both, or maybe none of these questions, then <strong>this is the game for you</strong> !\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn Suds of War, you control plastic boats in a war to dominate the bathtub. Destroy enemy ships and attack the enemy base (a sponge). Rubber ducks block your way to victory, so go around them.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou start the game with three ships, try to hold on to them. If for some reason all three cannot be placed, the others will be available for immediate spawning, but you can only spawn next to your base.\r\n</p>Controls<p>\r\n\tLeft-Click to select or deselect a ship Right-Click after selecting to attack or move\r\n</p>Tips<p>\r\n\tAt the bottom of the screen is an end turn button and the status of your ships.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tClick the ship icon to respawn a ship. Ships have a cooldown timer that is displayed on the button. The more ships you have down, the longer it takes them to respawn.\r\n</p>Goal<p>\r\n\tYour goal is to destroy the enemy sponge before the enemy ships destroy your sponge.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd88fefbc56d67daa300140e05c374f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jdunlap1974"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
