I really enjoy working on this game and I continue to continue development on many more systems. This is currently in alpha and I plan on adding a ton of new features, including a better health system, homing missiles, massive laser pulse, and many other enemy types. Stay tuned to keep up with the project.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Platforms:</p>\n<ul><li>Windows</li><li>macOS</li><li>WebGL</li></ul>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Visual Studio</li><li>Adobe Photoshop</li><li>Ableton Live</li><li>GDHQ Filebase</li><li>Unity Asset Store</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T06:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afaed5079190f540a53310e1dc07f165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Red Rook Interactive"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
