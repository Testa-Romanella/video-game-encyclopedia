The theme was \"Only One\", meaning you had to limit something to one in your game. I chose to create an Action RPG with just one screen. This project turned out being far larger than I expected, and of course I\u00a0didn't get done nearly as much as I\u00a0wanted, so I will most likely be continuing the project for a brief period of time and upload it as a post-jam. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>There's no sound because I had absolutely no time to implement sounds in the game, look for it in the post-jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cf865c89ff47e7db019c0b72c90501c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Game Endeavor"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
