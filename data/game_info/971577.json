Performing the more traditional input properly will reward players with a slight meter boost. The goal is to allow players who may struggle with these types of input to still have a level of success when playing MerFight and help them get into the game more quickly!<br/><br/><strong>Pop Cancels</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>With this explosive mechanic, players can double-tap in any direction during most actions such as jumping, normal attacks, and special attacks, to cancel them, allowing them to extend combos or avoid getting punished after a traditionally unsafe attack.<br/><br/><strong>Pop Push and Pop Roll</strong><br/><br/><br/>While blocking, players can press <strong>HP+HK</strong> to Pop Roll, allowing them to roll forward of the way and potentially punish their opponent\u2019s offense.<br/>They can also press <strong>LP+LK</strong> to Pop Push, in which they can push opponents back, creating space between them and their opponent.<br/><br/><strong>Unique Meter Management</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In MerFight there are two types of energy that can be spent. The main energy meter allows players to perform super moves. When one bar of that meter is filled, that player earns a Pop. If the player has filled all 3 energy meters, they cannot earn anymore Pops, so they will need to spend their meter if they want to earn more Pops.<h3>STORY</h3><br/>A Tail of Fish Out of Water, Terrestrially Retold<br/><br/>In the earliest of days, the three ancients oversaw all life.  The ancients, The Aquatic, The Terrestrial, and The Empyrean were each a transfiguration of 3 separate elements, holding the world in balance.  One day, an ancient shark warrior manifested the Celestial Tide, an atmospheric pool of water, causing all those in the land and sky to perish.  This action caused The Terrestrial and Empyrean to disappear as well, leaving The Aquatic as the sole life force.  As The Aquatic was forced to become all 9 elements, it punished all life in the ocean by forcing them onto the land.<br/><br/>Harmony between the 9 elements hangs by a fine string - this is the story of trying to recapture a balance that is almost undone.<h3>FEATURES</h3><strong>AVAILABLE NOW</strong><br/>12 Playable Characters<br/>Online Lobbies (Rollback Netcode!)<br/>Combo Challenges<br/>Block &amp; Punish Challenges<br/>9/13 Stages (some of which will still be updated)<br/><br/><strong>COMING SOON</strong><br/>Improved Arcade Mode<br/>Story Mode<br/>More Combo Challenges<br/>Other Unlockables", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T20:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1d2a7fbd5252cbca7a92df5f50bc543.jpg", "website": "https://www.merfight.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mattrified Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mattrified Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
