You play a brave sorceress who has entered a ruined castle full of monsters and cultists in an attempt to banish an evil demon before he can lay waste to the kingdom. Navigate 10 levels of increasingly intense action, pitting your Wand of Lightning against goblin mercenaries, fire-breathing drakes, zombies, and the demon lord Moloch! Find hidden passages and collect treasures!</p>\n<p>This game is currently in a Beta phase- feature complete, \u00a0but I'm keeping an eye out for bugs and/or possible gameplay improvements, and just generally wanting to know what people think. It's a short game that I hope will be useful as a model for larger projects, but should be a fun time in itself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b895a44ad930775ddcb4d2b1bae2f6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Evan Waters"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
