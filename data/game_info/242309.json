There is no police to slow you down and no one to pick up. Practice your jumping skills or just drive as fast as you like, but be careful not to damage the paintwork as you haven't finished paying for it yet. If you do crash, don't worry a quick reset will have your truck all shiny and new again.... Ready for you to smash it up again. Don't forget to use the different camera angles to give you cool views and different angles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/6578ea137094a6fc97723f3177542758_kuGVgue.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["freeonlinegames.com"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["FreeOnlineGames.com FZE"], "esrb_rating": null}
