Just keep tapping the screen to move the bird upwards, it comes downwards with gravity. You may also collect diamonds during the game to earn more points. Keep your bird alive as long as possible while avoiding spikes in order to achieve a high score.<br/>That is not as simple as you think because the things are getting tougher since the spikes which you need to avoid will become more and more as well as the your safer space on the wall becomes smaller and with this set up everything will become more difficult.<br/>Features:<br/>-Apple Watch Version<br/>-Vivid Graphics<br/>-Simple Controls<br/>-Easy to play but hard to master<br/>-Multiple characters to unlock<br/><br/>Support and Feedback:<br/><br/>If you have any technical issue please contact us at info@teensystudios.com.<br/>Please include the device information and if possible send a screenshot of the problem.<br/>The more information that you provide to us, the better we can serve you and<br/>fix the bugs that may exist.
