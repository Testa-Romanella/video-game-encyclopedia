Find effects, step on sandcastles and find secrets! (there's only one secret)</p>\n<p>The Jam version has 4 findable effects, 4 and a ...half? worlds to explore, and approximately 3 events.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is going to be reworked now that the Jam is over and I'm not on a time limit. Maps will change drastically and be made richer and more fun to walk around. This is like a small slice of the Nocti pie (that hasn't been put in the oven yet...) so you can get a taste of the sprite art style and general feel I'm going for.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/4029ff6acc8584894a1e45578b44c8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nuxill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
