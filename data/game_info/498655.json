Bounce your way up as high as you can in this jelly-filled infinite climber. Watch out for electricity or you'll have to start back from the bottom!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong>Just click and drag like a slingshot to launch the slime in the opposite direction. You can only jump launch before contacting another wall.<br/><br/></p><p>Big thanks to\u00a0Baharto for the game music, and my girlfriend for the title art!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:34:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/623/6230f1863ce63ef296ba16a90ab8ee57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wbschultz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
