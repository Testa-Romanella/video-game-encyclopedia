Afterwards, as a team, we decided to continue working on the game in order to submit it to Indiecade or future game festivals and possibly, Steam Greenlight, eventually. We continued working on the game either at home or at school whenever we had time. We would try and meet weekly face to face and Skype when we couldn't. Since we are all full time students and some work part-time it was sometimes challenging to meet, collaborate and work on the game.</p><p>Patikake was heavily influenced by traditional Japanese Sumo wrestling, Bennett Foddy's Get On Top and Divekick from Iron Galaxy Studios. Originally, Patikake was inspired by a Korean balance game where players try to make each other lose balance by pressing on the other person's hands or by faking them out. The game then developed to where it is now as more of a Sumo wrestling like game where one player tries to push or throw the other player out of the arena.</p><p>Visit our Website:</p><p>http://patikake.weebly.com/<br/></p><p>Follow Us On Facebook &amp; Twitter!<br/></p><p>https://www.facebook.com/teampatikake<br/></p><p>https://twitter.com/teampatikake<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27b6eed17b317a09fc55ed5f8932c214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Novosel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
