I just started learning game dev at the end of April 2021.</p>\n<p>You are a central planner in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. As the economy rapidly grows through the introduction of new products, the paperwork to plan it all piles on. Can you use the planning tools at your disposal: the trusty ol\u2019 pen and paper, the slide rule, and even the newfangled computer, to lead us to surpass the west in material satisfaction - and achieve Red Plenty?\r\n</p>\n<p>In this central planning click \u2018em up, you will tangle with learning the dynamics of an economy that is growing and its information processing needs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are a few\u00a0ways to lose, and only one way to win. Figure out the pattern to avoid revolution (letting product variety get to 0), invasion (letting GDP get to 0), and information overload (letting information backlog get above 350) - all before the millennium dawn of the year 2000. To win, figure out the dynamic pattern to achieve Red Plenty by the year 2000. In other words, get above 350 GDP and 0 information backlog.\r\n</p>\n<p>Expected play time: 5 - 10 minutes.\r\nFor more information on this work, check out: https://gceh.ca/2020/02/04/the-impact-of-zero-sum-thinking-on-the-failure-to-implement-a-soviet-internet-and-its-lessons/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T05:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/743/743a5edb717583791271940a6586ec9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gceh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
