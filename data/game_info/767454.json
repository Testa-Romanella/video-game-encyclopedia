This is our first game and first participation in Ludum Dare. I hope you will enjoy!</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam is \"Delay the Inevitable\" and the first thought that came to our mind was the theme of growing up. After playing the game you will find yourself in the role of a child who will grow up with each new level, change his preferences, change his outlook on life. Enjoy the game and experience growing up with the main character. Maybe this game will make you think.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to install the font from the Font folder.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T00:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c766e29acd05ab32df7a45aaa80fce62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamirEmpty"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
