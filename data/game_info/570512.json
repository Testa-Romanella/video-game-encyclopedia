It is highly inspired by The Stanley Parable. I can't really tell the demo is finished but it is somewhat playable in this state so I decided to share it with you guys. There is not much in terms of \"game play\" in this demo. It is more of a narrative game just like The Stanley Parable. I can't really tell about the story of the game without spoiling it. So if you are looking for a unique and short experience you might wanna give this game a try. I would really like to hear feedback from you. Tell me what you think and please let me know if you find any game breaking bugs.\u00a0Thanks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/062/06244fef34ac603f4624e92881c10bee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ji Yan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
