Hi!</p>\n<p>If you want to see a highly inaccurate but cute lil solar system model, check this out!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>I added the following elements in the original release:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Realistic textures and specular shaders (high smoothness but low shine for ideal \"planets in space\" look)\r\n</li><li>A separate\u00a0sun halo object, for more realistic glow effect\r\n</li><li>Varied pitch for planet hum based on\u00a0size (so they harmonize with each other\u00a0when they pass by!)\r\n</li><li>An absurdly simple \"UI\" (it only includes the background for the mini-map and the mini-map itself; it also scales to the screen)\r\n</li></ol>\n<p><strong>... and added these additional ones in version 2.0:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>A new environment, originally created in Blender by anDDDres on Sketchfab and modified by me in Blender\u00a0to suit the game</li><li>An original Blender model of an 8-planet orrery (excluding moons)<ol><li>The arms, poles, and their respective planets rotate together around the \"Sun\"\u00a0parent game object to mimic a motorized/mechanical model!</li><li>The \"wiring\"\u00a0runs up through the center pole to the \"SunStar\" game object, which is, in fiction, a semi-translucent sphere with a light inside! Pretty neat!</li></ol></li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Textures by\u00a0Solar System Scope\r\n</li><li>\"90's Teen Bedroom\" model by anDDDres</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:17:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1c4bdda06f772323d7e2f8aa10a083c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nonabeans"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
