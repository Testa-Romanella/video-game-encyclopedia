GameJam meant 48h to develop a game in a team from scratch. In this time we discussed the idea, programmed the controls and every behaviour, designed all graphics, included effects and different game modes and also composed the music. After one hell of a weekend version 1.0 was ready to be played. It was a local playable game which seemed to be very amusing.</p>\n<p>Neo Puck is based on the pricinples of an air hockey game. Two players try to kick the puck into one of the two opponents goals. But there is not only a twist in the arena design but also in the players control. It possible to move / rotate the player and to alter its size. Thereby small but fast and strong players face big and slow players. Additional modes alternating in each round make the game even more challenging and fun to play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:49:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da0f5f86ee167d0af16ebe205357de74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LMNT GAMES"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
