{"id": 10769, "slug": "go-go-electric-samurai", "name": "Go Go Electric Samurai", "name_original": "Go Go Electric Samurai", "description": "Go Go Electric Samurai is a competitive multiplayer arena shooter. It's hockey, in spaceships, on an obstacle course, with psychedelic visuals and a pulse-pounding soundtrack. Players go head to head in 1v1 to 3v3 setups and try to get the ball in the opposing team's net while shooting down enemy players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach ship comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  Some will have more speed and maneuverability while others will have more defence to withstand shots.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is built with a community in mind and so we're looking to you for feedback on what power-ups/features you'd like to see in the game.  The game is also supported with community tournaments, including a launch tournament that has a $1,000 prize pool.
