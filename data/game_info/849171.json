So starting tomorrow you'll be our new haunted artifact collector!\u00a0<br/><br/>Your job is to investigate the job sites given to use by clients\u00a0and find any relics that are binding any unwelcome spirits to the area. After you're finished the more seasoned members will come in to identify the ghost(s) and exorcise them.<br/><br/>Normally we'd find the artifacts but after a few incidents... we thought it would be smart to have some fresh blood\u00a0get the artifacts to help with the work load.</p>\n<p>~Any rumors that ghosts are stronger when the artifact is still present on the job site is purely speculation. Spirit Watch has done internal testing and found no evidence to support this claim!~</p>\n<p>Pay ~10/hr\u00a0 *May fluctuate depending on performance.</p>\n<p>1 PTO day a year.<br/></p>\n<p>Holidays not guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this is as exciting for you as it is for us! See you soon!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>~DEVELOPER NOTES~<br/>-This is a side project I'm doing in my down time, but I'm hoping to get levels out as fast as I can. Donating and contributing to my Patreon are the best ways to help me out with this.</p>\n<p>-If you enjoy the project, let me know! If this does well, I'll add more levels and add more complete features.</p>\n<p>-Feel free to post your videos in the page comments! Watching people play is the best way for me to get feedback I\u00a0can work with.<br/><br/>-If you're wanting to help support me:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/DarkslayerTV</p>\n<p>-Known Issues: End of game timer displays incorrectly, certain options display the wrong setting when returning to the options menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:55:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c0cd07b7a59cb21f1c6cefad2c23daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Winkler"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
