Eventually eventually will be a proper game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kind of a mash up between Megaman Legends, Dark Souls, Super Smash Bros, and Zelda: BOTW in terms of gameplay and graphics. <br/></p>\n<p>Currently very early prototype. Work List:</p>\n<p>1. Character controller: First draft finished, needs polish &amp; bug fixes. <br/></p>\n<p>2. Character behavior system: cousin to the reaver behavior system, proc anim layers on top of keyframed base layer. <br/></p>\n<p>3. Camera Rig: First draft finished, needs polish &amp; bug fixes</p>\n<p>4. Reaverbot behavior system: Currently working on this. Will hopefully have generic and some specific reaver behaviors system in place by mid-end of february. Probably have to rewrite a lot of what I've got currently.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>5. Level Design/World building: Make/find as much world info, narrative info possible to distill into the level design. Also figure out platforming along the way. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/5651d02570b6d6a0da8a2f6b9004d8f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sidwasnothere"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
