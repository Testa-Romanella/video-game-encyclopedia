See below for a list of changes, and the new downloads.</strong></p><p><strong>Skyw0r is a space combat arcade-adventure rendered in an 8-bit graphical style. </strong>Using the keyboard and/or joystick, the player pilots his/her starship to different sectors of the galaxy to engage in challenging 3-D dogfights with alien ships, visit friendly planets to repair and refuel, and generally shoot/dodge/grab cool stuff in space. There may also be an infiltrator mode, where you enter derelict freighters in a space suit and fight crazy robots while trying to retrieve treasure or secret datafiles. Skyw0r is inspired by the space-combat home-computer and console games of the 70's and 80s, particularly the works of Doug Neubauer at Atari Corporation. <strong>Skyw0r is currently in playable alpha.</strong></p><p>NEW alpha trailer video:<br/></p><p>Some video of v0.6:<br/></p>New in v0.8<ul><li>The distance and direction to the current mission objective are now shown on the map.</li><li>Endurium fuel is now cheaper, and the asteroid fields yield more of it.</li><li>Enemies sometimes drop endurium crystals when destroyed; harvest them to refuel your ship.</li><li>There are now enemies in some asteroid fields.</li><li>All map objects display helpful labels when you are nearby.</li><li>The player begins farther away from the starbase, and must find it using the beacon.</li><li>Bomber jet firing rate reduced a bit.</li><li>Fixed missing keybindings.</li><li>Fixed incorrect camera position/angle on switching to some flight mode scenes</li></ul>Historical references  <p> These are some videos of classic games by the great Atari programmer, Doug Neubauer.
