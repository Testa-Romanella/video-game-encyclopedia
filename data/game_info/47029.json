The player is only able to view one primary color at a time, alongside secondary colors composed of that primary color. While the spectrum limitation does hinder the player's ability to see the full picture, it allows them to move without fear of coming in contact with the dangerous beams of concentrated light.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/06023a8d60fbd7452213d4b038c146bb.jpg", "website": "https://ottercopter.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 102}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jorge Castaneda", "Caliber Seraphim", "Nicholas Carlson", "James Smith"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Ottercopter Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
