{"id": 579890, "slug": "climber-isanelegy", "name": "Climber (IsAnElegy)", "name_original": "Climber (IsAnElegy)", "description": "<p>A small game about jumping up on top of blocks. Blocks fall from the top of the screen, and the player must avoid being crushed and jump on top of them to get to the end of the level. 4 levels, with different blocks such as slippery blocks, bouncy blocks, and spike blocks that hurt the player if they land on them. Move left and right with the arrow keys. Jump with the Q key. Attack and break blocks with the W key.</p>\n<p>I made this game about 3 years ago, and at the time wasn't too proud of it. It took me much longer to finish than I had wanted, and by the time it was done, I didn't really feel that it was worth posting anywhere. After looking at it again, I'm actually pretty happy with it. I think the length of time it took me to finish influenced my initial impression, and after some time has passed, I am comfortable posting it.</p><p>Footage : </p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf5/bf5569b8f5a211e663323b1ea5076fc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsAnElegy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
