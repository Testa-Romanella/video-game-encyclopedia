Therefore I am submitting what I was able to get done, then getting some rest.<br/><br/>The Theme of the Jam is <strong>Roll Of The Dice</strong>.<br/><br/>I interpreted that as a top down 2D shooter where the guns shoot dice instead of bullets, and the damage that gets dealt is based on the value the dice rolled.<br/><br/>The player plays as Dicey Dangers, and can choose between a weapon that fires Three 3 Sided Die, a weapon that fires Two 6-sided Die, or a weapon that fires One 12-sided Die.<br/><br/>There are 3 enemies that will attack Dicey. White Dominoes that just push Dicey around, Blue Dominoes that shoot at Dicey, and Red Dominoes that leave bullet trails behind that Dicey could run into.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this game and I look forward to next next GMTK Jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15a/15a8494f26309e4f60f6f242e59b16d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thewizofpants"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
