The Colonel's lips are pretty chapped though, so he needs you to sneak into the Potato Cyborg Temple and retrieve some lip balm. Can you sneak past the killer Potato Cyborgs and save the day?</p><p>I was planning on making a game for itch jam, but the event ended up getting postponed. Instead, I decided to jam over the weekend by myself! My employer, SkyBox Labs, let me stream the entire development of the game online. You can view the recorded stream over on twitch.tv, although it's pretty long!<br/></p><p>There are too many to name all here, but I wanted to thank my friends, family, SkyBox Labs, and everyone in the chat who encouraged me and helped me with making this game over the weekend. It's very dear to me having your support in something that brings me so much joy. Making games is fun too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d277275052f41fb3d00b21ac8d09fc7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Savage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
