You can \r\npause the game and access menus with the Escape key or the start/menu \r\nbutton on a controller. Controller support should work fine for Xbox and\r\n \r\nXbox-compatible controllers, but non-xinput controllers are \r\nnot currently supported. Stairs are designed to be able to be walked \r\nthrough. Press the up or down arrow keys (or whatever you've mapped up \r\nand down to) to get on stairs when at the bottom or top of a staircase.</p>\n<p>Bug reports and suggested fixes or improvements are welcomed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdb634028f7fa3de36af026c014ec680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["General Vagueness"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
