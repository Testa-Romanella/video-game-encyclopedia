{"id": 3315, "slug": "magicka-2", "name": "Magicka 2", "name_original": "Magicka 2", "description": "<p>Magicka 2 is an action-adventure game developed by Arrowhead Game Studios. The game serves as a direct continuation of the first Magicka.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, four mages saved Midgard from complete destruction. However, the war between magic schools broke out after that. Most of the wizards passed away. Humanity entered a Golden Age without the mages destroying the human&#39;s way of life. During this period a prophecy of a child that would make Midgard a better place emerges. The prophecy also told that the evil forces will oppose the child. Mages set out on a quest to save the child.</p>\n<p>The game could be played alone or in a cooperative mode with up to four players. Unlike most role-playing games, Magicka 2 does not feature any class system. Every character is armed with a staff and a melee weapon.</p>\n<p>Magicka 2 features a high degree of satire and a lot of references to other games. For example, one of the weapons the player can use is the Excalibur or the M60 machine gun crafted by a local blacksmith from a string and a shotgun. The main feature of the game is the dynamic spellcasting system that allows combining 8 elementals in order for the player to choose their own playstyle.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2015-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:08:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/516/516c6bfe36ddb498d860f68927448a75.jpg", "website": "http://www.magicka2.com", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 228, "owned": 3440, "beaten": 288, "toplay": 63, "dropped": 335, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 188, "ratings_count": 660, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 664, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Paradox Interactive", "Pieces Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
