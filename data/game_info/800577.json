I worked my ass off to deliver this demo,\u00a0and I\u00a0wanted to finally release it into the wild.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><strong>Demo Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Cross-reality, co-op gameplay between two local players (Oculus PC HMDs only)</li><li>Independent, simultaneous\u00a0audio output to two separate audio drivers</li><li>Some sweet tunes<br/>\n</li><li>Some cool art\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Demo Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0These credits are strictly for this demo.

This demo will not run as a stand-alone app on\u00a0Quest. It will not run on SteamVR. Use a Rift or Oculus Link.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is the same build that I\u00a0submitted to Meta at the conclusion of my Launch Pad program in January 2020. I\u00a0put this demo together over the course of three months, all while working a full-time,\u00a0corporate IT job (i.e., 40+ hours per week). I\u00a0later won a scholarship from Meta in May 2020\u00a0for my work on this demo.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Concerning the gameplay timer:<br/><br/></strong>There were a limited number of judges with a limited amount of time to play through each submitted demo from Launch Pad. I\u00a0don't remember how many projects were submitted at the end, but there were about 100 developers in my cohort. The judges put a strict 5-minute limit on gameplay evaluations, and I added the timer to make their lives a little bit easier. No, it can't be disabled. No, I won't make a new build without the timer.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T14:46:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dcd3d4613f2c2d37cc335d10bea2e44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeplmr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
