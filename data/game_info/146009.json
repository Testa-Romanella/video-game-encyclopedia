Beat, smack and crash your opponent in a race to the finish line, to impress your boss, avoid certain death and get to your goal. The game is a fast paced, top down race to the finish line. Smash open the eggs and match your players \"key\" to items found in the eggs, and your door to the next room of the office will open. Try to pay attention to what other players open, you might need it to get to the next room!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bfd3318b6f16cc51f58c326b4773531.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunchbox Media"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
