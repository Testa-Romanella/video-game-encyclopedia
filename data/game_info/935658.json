THIS TOWN AIN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE TWO OF YOU.</p>\n<p>Challenge friends in an online 1v1 fps game for some chaotic fun as you find new ways to exploit the combat and seek tactical positioning or somehow find a way to speed across the entire map in seconds. This game was made for lync game jam and as such was created in a limited amount of time so expect the bugs or exploit them. This game is intended to be played with 2 players however it can be played with more (but is not intended to be or designed to be). In addition, for testing it can also be played using two tabs of the same game and simply switching between them.
