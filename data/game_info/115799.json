You start as a triangle and you can progress to a circle. Shots are fired from the sides of your shape. Rotate your shape and if you destroy the approaching shapes you get points, but if they hit you, your shape gets lowered a level down and you change color. Every color has a different power!</p>\n<p>Developed by: Filip Hadzi-Ristic (hadzi96@hotmail.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae69b05cc14c6b0e45c30f3901ef495a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Hadzio Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
