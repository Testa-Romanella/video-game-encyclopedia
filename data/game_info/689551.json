You can travel throughout a large galaxy, fighting enemy ships and trading cargo.</p>\n<p>You can fly any of the ships, the screenshots are the starter ship, which is light and maneuvrable, but you have to save up for the bigger ships.</p>\n<p>Play with keyboard and / or gamepad / joystick.</p>\n<p><strong>Keys</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>W</strong> [L Axis UP] - <em>Forward</em> ...\u00a0<strong>S</strong> [L Axis DOWN] - <em>Backward</em></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> [L Axis LEFT] - <em>Rotate Left</em> ...\u00a0<strong>D</strong> [L Axis RIGHT] - <em>Rotate Right</em></p>\n<p><strong>LEFT</strong> [R Axis LEFT] - <em>Roll Left</em> ...\u00a0<strong>RIGHT</strong> [R Axis RIGHT] - <em>Roll Right</em></p>\n<p><strong>UP</strong> [R Axis UP] - <em>Pitch Down</em> ...\u00a0<strong>DOWN</strong> [R Axis DOWN] - <em>Pitch Up</em></p>\n<p><strong>SPACE</strong> [R Trigger 1] - <em>Fire</em>\n</p>\n<p>Numpad <strong>4</strong>\u00a0[DPAD L] - <em>Strafe Left</em> ...\u00a0Numpad <strong>6</strong>\u00a0[DPAD R] - <em>Strafe Right</em></p>\n<p>Numpad <strong>8</strong>\u00a0[DPAD U] - <em>Strafe Up</em> ...\u00a0Numpad <strong>2</strong>\u00a0[DPAD D] - <em>Strafe Down</em></p>\n<p><strong>Escape</strong> [B Button] - <em>Pause Menu</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Return</strong> [A Button] - <em>Select</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay is between the space station (large cruiser ship with landing area) and flight around, and the navigation chart to reach other planets, which is accessed through the pause menu (ESCAPE key)</li><li>In order to dock simply fly close to the landing area (yellow crosshatched area). Be careful not to fly too fast.</li><li>In order to hyperspace you will need to buy fuel in the space station REPAIR menu</li><li>Larger ships will yield more cargo and are less able to fight back. Small ships can decide to attack you .. any ship will go into attack mode if hit by laser etc.</li><li>Find planets to trade between with good price differential (if you have storage for cargo), or destroy ships for their cargo.</li><li>Upgrade as soon as you can to make your ship able to carry more, and work better in flight.</li><li>Once you have enough money you can buy a new ship, but beware you will lose upgrades. Larger ships are better for trading but difficult for combat.</li><li>If you want to cheat you can activate the debug option through the options menu (when paused) and pressing P will autodock to the nearest space station.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>\n<p>As this is quite a complex game you may discover bugs, especially in the economy, please let me know in the comments and I will get them fixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Future</strong></p>\n<p>The game so far is a minimum version to get started. If there is sufficient interest I will add more ships, upgrades, weapons (e.g. homing torpedos, mines, shields, EMP\u00a0etc), and work more on the economics and trading. Also an Android version may be possible with touchscreen controls, the rendering uses OpenGL ES2 so should be compatible with low end devices.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Version 1.01</em>\u00a0- Upgrades are now cheaper, and are kept when your ship is destroyed. Crate forcefield behaviour fixed.</p>\n<p><em>Version 1.02</em> - Fixed bug where upgrades were not loaded from save games correctly. Increased hold size of first ship to 300.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T07:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0da/0daf6dff5e96bb332c81f4729aa00383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["lawnjelly"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
