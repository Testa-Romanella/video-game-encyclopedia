It was originaly used for some bizzare old german golf simulator. If you never heard of it, check it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We thought it would be a fun way to control movement. Or goal was to create the movement as good and natural as possible so it would be fun just to fly around the space. We believe that we achieved that. We have spent so much time tweaking and testing it, that we gave up on working on the game theme completely. Sorry for that, but time ran out.</p>\n<p>In the end, we also added support for gamepads. We have tested it on XBox One and Logitech Rumblepad F510 devices.</p>\n<p>Here is a short video of us, playing the game on Gametrak.</p>\n\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>You control the aircraft flying through a cave in the dark. Your lights slowly turn down, but you can recharge them by collecting batteries. Position of a battery is always show in your hud, but you need to find the way. If you hit a wall, the game restarts (after you press a button). Let us know in the comments how many you managed to collect!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>gamepad:\u00a0<br/>left stick to control direction of left engines, left trigger to control thrust of left engines<br/>right stick to control direction of right engines, right trigger to control thrust of right engines</p>\n<p>gametrak:<br/>horizontal position of your left hand controls the rotation of left engines, and distance from the ground controls thrust, analogicaly for the right hand<br/>if gametrak is connected, you will be prompted to calibrate your maximum and minimum hand positions on startup</p>\n<p>There is no keyboard control, because it would take away all the fun. Please trust us on this, we tried.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the game<br/>Have fun</p>\n<p>- Dominik, Filip</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/941/94188ca2994b6078ffd07474b0bf3cc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dominik Konecny"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
