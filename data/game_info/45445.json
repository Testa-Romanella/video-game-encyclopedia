To do this, you will have to strategically build up your hospital in order to address what you deem to be your most pressing concern. Each morning, patients will queue up outside your hospital and try to find a place inside to be cured. However, if one of them can\u2019t find a bed they\u2019ll stop and wait, and everyone behind them will have to wait as well. So do you try and optimise your hospital for one type of disease and treat the pesky patient that will hold up your queue yourself? Or do you build your hospital to treat as broad a number of diseases as possible and sacrifice greater capacity and efficiency?Features<ul><li>Easy-to-learn but difficult-to-master gameplay.<br/></li><li>Original art style with monsters you\u2019ll learn to love.<br/></li><li>Awesome music to keep you in the zone.<br/></li><li>100 hand-crafted replayable levels.<br/></li><li>Unlockable endless mode with randomly generated levels \u2013 play forever!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cfaf1efb744b53a2258010c58f6083c.jpg", "website": "http://monstersandmedicine.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Clockwork Acorn"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Clockwork Acorn"], "esrb_rating": null}
