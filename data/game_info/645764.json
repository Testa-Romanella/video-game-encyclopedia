At the start of the simulation every polity(tile) is generated over a hand drawn map. Each polity has resources based on the terrain it spawns on with some terrain yielding more resources than others.\u00a0Each has a percentage chance of choosing to declare war on a weaker neighbor. Every time a polity conquers a neighbor they gain a portion of their resources and transfer ownership of the polity to\u00a0themselves. There is a random chance of rebellion that can occur to each polity which will either have the entire nation collapse or have a portion of it rebel into independent states.</p>\n<p>road map:</p>\n\n<p>Temporarily switched Europe Map to a Fantasy Map for the current update.</p>\n<p>-add region-based alliances:</p>\n<p>Each polity now randomly has a chance of allying a bordering polity which gives bonuses to their military strength, the chance of cancelling the alliance\u00a0increases as the polity becomes larger than the ally.</p>\n<p>-add a UI that allows the user to see all aspects of the simulation\u00a0</p>\n<p>New UI Added in latest version</p>\n<p>-better camera:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to pan the camera and use keypad + /- to zoom in or out.</p>\n\n<p>bug fix note:</p>\n<p>increased chance for nation\u00a0 to collapse.</p>\n<p>rebalanced total annexation mechanic</p>\n<p>game speed slowed down for testing purposes.</p>\n<p>fixed error where rebelling polities retained stats pre-rebellion</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T08:17:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18b2a31a82faec17968e0eacf8bc7827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hprogrammer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
