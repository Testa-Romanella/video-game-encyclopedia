After a short time, the numbers disappear and the player is asked to type in the correct sequence of the numbers they just saw. The game then progresses to the next level, with a longer sequence of numbers to remember.</p>\n<p>As the player progresses through the levels, the number sequences become longer and more difficult to remember, making the game a challenging test of memory and concentration. It is often used as a tool for assessing memory skills and cognitive function in individuals of all ages, as well as for training and improving memory skills.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T09:35:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcb7114dd10f9c9512a1f55e9d06a06e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sanmaniro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
