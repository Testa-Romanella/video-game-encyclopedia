It is therefore your job to safely coordinate the recharging and redeployment of every robot, without incident.</p>\n<p>\u2018Robotics Charging Coordinator\u2019 is a 3D strategic game, played from a top down perspective.\u00a0 As the player you are tasked with directing a plethora of robots to their respective charging locations (specified by colour), while ensuring that the robots never collide with each other.\u00a0 Once a robot has been charged it will exit the play area in a predetermined direction.\u00a0 Robot type will be designated by scale, with their respective speed decreasing as the types increase in size.\u00a0 A counter will display the value of remaining robots, which will decrease with every robot that the player successfully charges;\u00a0 throughout the game the spawn rate of the robots will increase until the player is either overwhelmed or has managed to successfully charge every robot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sourced Assets:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Polyart Studio.
