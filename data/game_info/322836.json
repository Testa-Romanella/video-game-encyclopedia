You can kick yourself from grave to grave by sheer force of will. You are searching for a sign. Specifically, a sign with a picture of a skull on it.</p>\n<p>This little game was created using free assets as a part of an application process for an unrelated game that is currently in development. The art is provided by https://www.gameart2d.com, while the lovely instrumental piano cover of Spooky Scary Skeletons comes from Myuu (https://soundcloud.com/myuu).</p>\n<p>Please enjoy, and let me know what you think! As ever, I'll probably come back and add a few things from time to time, so check back again later.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b1702b47e302726ef1c10084b40561c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ghostbrite"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
