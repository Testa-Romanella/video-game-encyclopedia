With more than one twist.<br/><br/>Play with your friends either on split screen or over the internet.<br/><br/>Run around in a maze, drop bombs to destroy the boxes and collect the powerups.<br/>Avoid being killed by your enemies or your own stupidity. Playing in insanity mode, the latter is harder than the former.<br/><br/>Playing much like the original, Hide and go Boom adds its own twists to the game.<br/>Instead of the birds eye view, you now enjoy a first person view of the action.Gameplay<ul><li>Drop bombs to destroy crates or enemies</li></ul><ul><li>Block in your opponents with your bombs</li></ul><ul><li>Strategically place bombs above or below enemies and hit them from an angle they don't expect</li></ul><ul><li>Explore the junkyard after you collect the jump buffs</li></ul><ul><li>2 distinct levels that offer very different experiences (more levels to come)</li></ul>Powerups<ul><li>Extra bombs</li></ul><ul><li>More powerful explosions</li></ul><ul><li>Remote control</li></ul><ul><li>Extra speed</li></ul><ul><li>Extra jump</li></ul><ul><li>Extra jump strength</li></ul><ul><li>One jump limit</li></ul><ul><li>Limited jump strength</li></ul><ul><li>Involuntary bomb dropping</li></ul>Planned powerups, not in the game yet<ul><li>Short fuse</li></ul><ul><li>Jetpack</li></ul><ul><li>Invulnerability</li></ul><ul><li>Timewarp</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/021995fb0beb60e5d6d4ebfb4e3d074a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 109}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Partial Reality"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Partial Reality"], "esrb_rating": null}
