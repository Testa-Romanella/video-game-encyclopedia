Only one disk may be moved at a time. <br/>2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. <br/><br/>3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T09:49:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a9c0382294a65454c26a502f87d20dd_Utaiz49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["ozzywow"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jinguk Hong"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
