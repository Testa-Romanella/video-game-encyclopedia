Right now there is no combat in the game, just the base building and drone hacking part is available, also resources are overly abundant in this build as its should be mostly seen as a proof of concept and a way to get players to play the game and provide feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T05:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce6a38ae0022b09f34f8ebb0c11c49d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lance"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
