Now there are more than 100 items in the game, from materials, food, medicine, weapons and armor, etc. The protagonist's family can get these items by searching for materials in the scene, trading with merchants, synthesizing through the workbench, or seizing from others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2. We have designed dozens of talents for the protagonist, each of which has its own attributes, from influencing the basic character attributes: coldness, health value, the use effect of items, as well as influencing the results of fighting and negotiating with others.
