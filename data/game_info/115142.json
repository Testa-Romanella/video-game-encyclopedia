And find your inner voice there and try to communicate?\u00a0</p>\n<p>MURMUR is a WIP abstract narrative audio/visual VR\u00a0experience about language and self perception\u00a0where you can use your voice to interact and progress through the narration.\u00a0When floating and humming, it feels\u00a0like doing paper marbling with your voice using light, colors and space.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine\u00a0an interactive\u00a0<em>Joan Mir\u00f3</em>\u00a0painting made\u00a0with elementary particles.</p>\n<p>MURMUR is also an experiment to push what can be done visually in VR,\u00a0melting foregrounds and backgrounds, glitching and\u00a0merging spaces and colors to trick the eyes and brain, opening ways to\u00a0new vistas\u00a0that can't be experienced in the real world.</p>\n<p>The sound will be a big part of the experience too, i used low frequency raw samples, and pieces of sound created by the Noise artist Yi Lu\u00a0to illustrate unknowns soundscapes and interactions. On a side note we've\u00a0 also been working together on live performances as the Audio/Visual duo Sondes.</p>\n<p><em>MURMUR is still in development, the demo available below is a visual proof of concept to get the mood of it, without narrative elements implemented yet, working on it!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1c13c252720ee14c6206d32ef07b6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S\u00e9bastien Labrunie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
