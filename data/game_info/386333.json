I\u00a0currently don't\u00a0 have enough to finish my game design at NYU. One of the many things\u00a0 I've been doing to raise money is begging the rich for money on twitter. Everyday I\u00a0think of more inventive ways to e-panhandle in hopes that some one with wild bread will bless the kid. In the game Twitter is a mall where you walk around and supplicate to the twitter profiles of rich people (hence the title), while baby boomers chase you down and shame you .\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire project was really fun to work on and I\u00a0often found myself unable to stop. This the first time I've felt like I've had a real grip on code at felt like I\u00a0was doing more than just scrambling to get things to work. The 3D modeling was also incredibly fun and I\u00a0had the chance to push myself in trying to model my own body. My worst decision was trying to make an anatomically correct model of a human, It took some much time but I'm definitely way more comfortable in Maya.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:36:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cdec2a27aeca63dc1e01b6e194cc4d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George Machado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
