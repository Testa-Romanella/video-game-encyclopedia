The demo version includes a backstory, a tutorial level, a regular level, and a boss.</p>\n<p>Difficulty level: Heavy Metal Jesus.</p>\n<p>Optimization level: as shit. But what do you expect from the devils-students, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay: nothing special, run, kick enemies, do desh, use a chainsaw for the only correct purpose: we cut enemies, and at the same time try not to get into bugs ._.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plot: for show.</p>\n<p>This game is a real retro shooter with a little touch of modern mechanics. Almost everything is like in 1994, just as crooked and ridiculous). In this game you are not an unbalanced destroyer of everyone and everything, in this game you are almost the same as all those who go against you, the benefit of a native double-barreled shotgun with a flamethrower never fails, with rare exceptions. All weapons have an alternative mode, (in the release version there will be about 12 of them, and in the release there will be a lot of unique worlds, namely as many as 7 unique locations and 3-5 levels for each). We really hope that this project will be interesting to people and will be completed.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD: move<br/>F:\u00a0kick<br/>1/2:\u00a0change weapons<br/>LMB: regular shoot<br/>RMB: alternative shoot<br/>SHIFT: dash<br/>Z: use chainsaw</p>\n<p>Developers: 2D artist - Sunrize; 3D artist - _Diablo_; Soundtrack - FanaticalProductions (Odious album); Gameplay: _Diablo_ and Sunrize.
