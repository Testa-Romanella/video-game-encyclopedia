You see, our fork-flourishing fraternity has one purpose: to sample meals crafted from what we call \"strange flesh\"; meats that have never been tasted by our members.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It's a thrilling little club, especially now, for we\u2019ve been branching out of the humdrum animal kingdom (of which we have sampled all we can) and have turned our culinary attention towards more \u2026 otherworldly fare. It truly is the most exciting time to be a Glutton Club member! And lucky you, you'll be present to witness it all\u2026 <em>Chef</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Introduction<br/>You are a member of the kitchen staff for the Glutton Club \u2014 a bizarre, secretive, \"rich people only\" social club that hires monster hunters to bring them new \"strange flesh\" for you to prepare and serve them.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Or, at least that's what they think is happening.</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>See, you and your team are actually supernatural beings\u2019 rights advocates, and you have taken it upon yourselves to protect vulnerable cryptids from reckless paranormal poachers like the ones these schmoes want you to hire. So instead, you\u2019ve got an arrangement with grocery suppliers to bring you ingredients that *didn't* know how to talk and/or cast magic at any point, and your team cleverly concocts <strong><em>Monstrous Menus for Mundane Meals</em></strong>. You call it the \"MM-MM Good\" protocol.</p>\n<p>The orders are being sent down from the penthouse lounge to the kitchens, and your deliveries are about to arrive\u2026 It\u2019s time to cook up some mock monster meat!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T13:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53cb2f3c8d19e7c5d311151021813860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ash Can Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
