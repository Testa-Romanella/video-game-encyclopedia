Prepare to die hundreds of times on a single level, but don't worry, you respawn in 1/60th of a second. Basically a single frame. Play as 15 characters with different abilities, levels, and stories (Except there's only 4 because the games still in development) and then play as over 100 bonus characters (That's also being worked on)</p>\n<p>Just play it, you can delete it later!</p>\n<p>Download the controller version of the game (It's way better)</p>\n<p>(Some stuff might change in later versions and actual release)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T21:39:27", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr.Endor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
