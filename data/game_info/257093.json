It's a rainy night in the suburbs of Vancouver, and the streets go dark yet again.\u00a0Even though you always have candles in your room you always seem to misplace them. Usually, you would just sit around, play on your phone until the electricity came back. This evening just so\u00a0happens to be a weekday where an important art project (that you totally did not procrastinate on)\u00a0is due tomorrow so you must urgently scramble to find enough candles in order to work on your project.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><em>This is a short autobiographical game done for Robert Yang's Intermediate Game Development class.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls </strong>are in the game but just in case you forgot to check:\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD to move<br/>SPACE to jump\u00a0<br/>LEFT CLICK to pick up objects<br/>RIGHT CLICK to drop objects<br/>ESC to see cursor\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Process\u00a0Log:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Working on this game really pushed me to be efficient with 3D\u00a0modeling. I\u00a0was always frustrated with using Maya, but this project made me discover ways to use Maya and Unity together in order to create something somewhat cohesive. I still have a long way to go in terms of modeling and programming, but I am generally happy with the decisions I\u00a0made with concept and\u00a0lighting. I made the game with the intention for the player to play it over and over again, because there are some difficult candles to acquire.\u00a0There are several bugs with the pick-upable items\u00a0and the jump doesn't feel smooth as I wanted, but\u00a0it was\u00a0extremely nice and nostalgic to make the space of my childhood bedroom in 3D nonetheless.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/515cb131b2e2aecad650d81732c9d3a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elizabeth Y"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
