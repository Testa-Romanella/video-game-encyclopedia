(You will see a short flash.)</p><p>In a few seconds, your line will hit the water. (You will see another short flash.)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Hooking a fish</strong></p><p>After the surface has calmed, fish will approach your line.</p><p>They will generally start by probing for a trap, taking tiny nips at the bait. (You will see an irregular series of quick flashes.)</p><p>Hold still, and wait for a solid bite. (You will see a longer flash.)</p><p>Quickly press the spacebar to set the hook.</p><p>If you succeed, you will feel the fish on the line. (You will see white flashes at regular intervals.) Continue to step 3.</p><p>If you fail to set the hook, the line will go slack again. (You will see black.)</p><p>As long as bait remains, the fish will eventually come again.</p><p>If you're worried that the bait is gone, give the line a tug to check. (You will see a short flash if the bait is still there).</p><p>If the bait is gone, tap the spacebar to start over. (You will see a long white flash while preparing your line to cast again.)</p><p><strong>Step 3: Reeling in a fish.</strong></p><p>While the fish is hooked, press the spacebar rapidly to reel it in.</p><p>If the line is too taut, take a break from reeling. (You will see solid white as long as the line is dangerously taut.)</p><p>While you aren't reeling, you can get a feel for how tired the fish is. (The regular blinking will slow as the fish tires out.)</p><p>Continue reeling, keeping the line from getting too taught, and you'll eventually pull the fish from the water. (You'll see steady, rapid flashing.) Congrats!</p><p>If you keep reeling a taut line, it may break. (You will see solid black.)</p><p>If you stop reeling for too long, the fish may escape. (You will see solid black.)</p><p>Win or lose, press the spacebar to prepare a new line. (You will see a long white flash while preparing your line to cast again.)</p><p>TLDR</p><p>Press space to cast your line.</p><p>Wait for a strong bite, then press space to set the hook.</p><p>Press space frequently to pull the fish in.</p><p>Stop pressing space if you see solid white.</p><p>Keep it up, and you'll net a fish.
