I\u00a0have changed my documentation software and will be posting updates to a website to be named, shortly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upgrades to the executable files will continue to be posted here as they come but I'm in the final stages of documenting design processes before jumping beyond the proof-of-concept stage that I\u00a0have on display, here.</p>\n<p>Thank you all so much for your support and patience. Just so you're all aware, the game will continue to be under the Creative Commons Attribution license.</p>\n<p>NOTE: I'm currently no longer streaming my design process. I just found it to be too dull for content</p><p>----</p>\n<p>The game is being created live via Twitch streams. Come check us out at twitch.tv/indievoyagerob on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2pm-4pm Pacific time. All documentation will be made available on this here itch.io page.</p>\n<p>Yar! is undergoing a massive overhaul. Now being made with RPG Maker MV, Yar! is <em>still</em> an ASCII-based game but now using the power and flexibility of the RPG Maker system. </p>\n<p>Making the move from Roguelike to RPG has been my desire all along, and now I can do so with a bit more comfort. As I complete my initial level, I'll begin posting it to Itch.io. </p>\n<p>Yar! is a highly experimental game that is inspired by the abstractness within games like FFVII, Sanitarium and Planescape: Torment. I hope you'll enjoy the ride. I know I will.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37f672cd2b60efefbc06733938fc7c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["indievoyagerob"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
