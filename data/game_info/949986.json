Feel the dread of fear lingering nearby and the exhilaration of being chased by demons and undead in this bloody violent horror first person shooter. A detailed Unreal Engine 5 game utilizing advanced Nanite and Niagara graphics.<h3>EXPLOSIVE ACTION</h3><br/><br/>Taking the proven formula of dark first person shooters and utilizing the powerful features available in Unreal Engine 5, including Nanite and Niagara, Eaten by Darkness takes the horror FPS predecessor concepts to a new level of immersion and brutality. Descending deeper into darkness increases the relentlessness of the monstrous horde.

Eaten by Darkness is a fast paced high tension action shooter throughout which you remain in control of your character at all times; this is not as a movie cut scene passive quick time event handholding game you just watch.<h3>MONSTROUS ENCOUNTERS</h3><br/><br/>The immersion is reflected in an ultra-streamlined user interface and interactive mechanics. Removal of health bars and onscreen survival micromanagement indicators allows you to enjoy the game in cinematic immersion while the intuitive design of the game sound and visuals provides meaningful feedback to you about the existing condition of your character.<h3>ENTER THE DEPTHS</h3><br/><br/>Additional streamlining removes the immersion breaking mechanics often seen in games today that require you to hold the \u201cF\u201d button to open doors; in Eaten by Darkness you just blast through enemies without halting the action. You don\u2019t need to stop to look for ammo, Eaten by Darkness lets you have fun and run around in horror and mayhem without the tedium of searching for a few bullets scattered around, the silliness of health potions popping out of enemies, or the unnatural glowing/floating collectibles that serve no purpose in the core game mechanics.
