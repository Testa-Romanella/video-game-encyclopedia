The goal is to connect all nodes in a level while not overloading them. Test your skill against 40 (!), semi-well-designed levels and be sure to take regular breaks and such.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a prototype, so please let me know what you think of it! The levels are not ordered in increasing difficulty, so I would be very interested to know which level you found the hardest. Any other critique and commentary would also be very appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T15:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/169/1695b0ed70429aa7f2e1617033b84fa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Trashtalk217"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
