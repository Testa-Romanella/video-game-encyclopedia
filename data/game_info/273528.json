It's a physics based puzzle game, similar to 90s classic 'Lemmings'.\u00a0 The aim of the game is to feed people to a giant robot to generate electricity, and it's more of a\u00a0\u00a0physics toy than a challenging puzzle.<br/>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t The theme for this Ludum Dare was 'Sacrifices Must be Made.\u00a0 We had a vague idea of having a robot eating people, and as this went well with the sacrifice theme we decided to use that as a starting point.\u00a0 From there we added the tiny people moving through the level, and decided you wouldn't have direct control over them, but would try to guide them into the robot's mouth.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\tEverything is controlled with the mouse, drag the various contraptions from the toolbar menu onto the level to build things.\u00a0 You can drag the bulldozer icon to remove things you don't need anymore.\u00a0 The levels can be completed fairly easily using fans, although this is not the most interesting way to play.\u00a0 It works best when you experiment, and try to find\u00a0the most stupid method of getting the people to the robot.</p>\n\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>ADAM</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; HUD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a57608cbe6fb05851d88c8f91e3dbb6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
