Standal)", "description": "<p>SAI is a third person action game exploring Celtic folklore and deforestation. Set in a magical forest, players will discover an environment damaged and destroyed by onslaughts of machines. These metallic creatures wreck their way through the land to get to the core of its magic, the Heart Tree. Though its presence is now but a lost memory, the machines remain, determined to find this all powerful entity. As a Druid, protector of the natural world, you must explore this beautiful realm, harness the power that still lingers here, and uncover its dark past. Stop the machines. Protect the land. Save the forest.</p>\n\n\n<p>SAI is Studio Mutiny's first game. As an eco-conscious Indie Games Development Studio, we made SAI because we want to make a difference. We want to reawaken the love and respect for nature we are all capable of. Therefore, we will be <strong>donating 80%</strong> of all revenue to conservation charities.</p>\n\n\n<p>Follow us on social media for more updates\u00a0 - @studiomutiny<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Estimated playtime: <strong>45min - 1 hour</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/224dc83c6abe7c5b14df9e016257013c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kasandra H.
