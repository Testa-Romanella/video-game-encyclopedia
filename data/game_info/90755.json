The meteors did little damage but for the following two weeks the sky was covered in a thin haze. When the haze cleared a massive alien ship could be seen hovering over the Atlantic Ocean near the European coast. It was so large it could be seen for hundreds of miles just hovering there, motionless in the sky for 8 months. Never moving. Never making contact.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFinally in February 2020 it happened. They attacked.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe meteor shower turned out to be a ploy to get their ground troops in position around the world. The alien intruders struck swiftly and without mercy. Less than 1% of the population escaped the planet to a space station built in secret for such an occasion.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIt is now 2025. With 5 long years waiting and over 90% of the population lost, we are finally able to mount an attack in an attempt to RECLAIM EARTH.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks to everyone who's made videos of the game :D If you upload a video, be sure to send us a link!
