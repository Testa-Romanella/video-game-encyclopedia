{"id": 406182, "slug": "escapetower-desktop", "name": "EscapeTower-Desktop", "name_original": "EscapeTower-Desktop", "description": "<p>EscapeTower is, unsurprisingly, a classic escape tower game, played from a first-person perspective, where the player has to solve a series of puzzles to reach the exit.</p>\n<p>It lasts around 10-20 minutes and <strong>*must* be played with a game controller</strong> (i.e. an Xbox-style gamepad).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why must it only be played with a controller? <strong>For science!</strong></p>\n<p>Escape Tower\u00a0was developed at the Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas) with the cooperation of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA) to understand player behaviours under certain conditions. To achieve that, the game records player actions and anonymously sends data to a server within the European Union to be further analysed and published. We need some elements of standardisation to make sure that all players have a similar experience - the controller is an important part of that. Sorry keyboard and VR gamers, we might do a version for you in the future, but at the moment the research questions require a controller.<br/></p>\n<p>By playing Escape Tower as you would play any other game, you'll help us to\u00a0understand some fundamental questions of game design, which we will share with developers to\u00a0\u00a0hopefully help them improve their games in future.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The subject of the research will not be revealed until the project is completed and the data is published in order to preserve players' natural behaviour from potential influences. One thing we will say though, is that we do collect very general data from you during the start of the game, but this has no impact on what happens after that data collection - <em>we don't adjust any gameplay based on your answers</em>.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, we will not be collecting data that would allow us to identify specifically who or where you are - the data collected will allow very broad categorisation, but might make a big difference to how games are designed (and researched) in the future.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>If you want to play a fun, short first-person puzzle game while helping science (and you've got a controller) then this is the game for you!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Designed by: Mata Haggis-Burridge and Thomas Buijtenweg<br/>Development and iteration: Riccardo Galdieri<br/>Additional development: Rob de Wit and Jacopo Fabrini<br/>Data collection software 'GURAAS': Carlos Santos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb151acd0255f5c351c60116a7859b08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rgaldieri", "Matazone"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
