You play a carpenter who needs to fix one single room that the house owners decided it would be just great to break holes in the walls and put spikes that might lead to the unfortunate demise of the carpenter.

Enjoy. If you can enjoy with this very boring short game. I\u00a0couldn't export for WebGL in time because the export was taking too long, and (as of writing this its 3:14, 14 minutes after the end of the jam) the export is at 30 minutes and 35 seconds. Well, that's unfortunate. I could only export for Windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/063/0633722dbb16dde82e953bac32462535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheUnknown1050"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
