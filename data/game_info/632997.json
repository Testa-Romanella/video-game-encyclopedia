Every twist and turn of your path feels both familiar and nonsensical. Turning back leads nowhere and the way ahead isn't getting easier. The only solution is to plod ahead, hoping that the end is in sight. You've been ensnared in Thoth's Curse!</p>\n<p>Bump and explore your way through a set of 20 random rooms from a larger pool. Use WASD on your MSX to control yourself, with M launching your trusty magnifying glass, hold down for an explosive charge shot! Navigate the dungeon and take down Thoth to win! Compatible with any MSX with greater than 8kbs of ram. Having a turbo CPU or an R800 might help slowdown a tad.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Web version available here<br/></p>\n\n<p>Retro Platform Jam #2 notes:<br/></p>\n<p>The title screen is supposed to evoke a bootleg multicart selection screen. Known bugs include the final boss hand wrapping and the inn text locking the player in place slowly. Sound effects aren't in the jam version as they caused some rooms to not load at the last second.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T07:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/9777e41376c306416efaaf2e0490582d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["McCheeseBob", "Lihpten"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
