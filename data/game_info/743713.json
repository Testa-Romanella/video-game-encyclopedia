Now, your Grandma is famous in the family for her cookies! And being the 'cookie-loving' grandson that you are, you cannot keep your mind off of her scrumptious, freshly baked goods!<br/><br/>As you explore through the different rooms of Grandma's house, you notice Grandma getting on with her day to day house-work and activities: sweeping the hallway, cleaning the dishes, catching up on knitting projects and so on... <br/><br/>You and Grandma are the best of friends! She takes you to the park to feed the ducks, to the beach to build sandcastles together and she always has her renowned cookies an arms length away! You've always wanted to learn to make cookies with her, but every time you ask to she refuses, saying how she'll take her secret cookie recipe to the grave with her!<br/><br/>As the years have gone by, Grandma's eyes have been getting worse, as has her memory! She always forgets where she leaves her glasses.<br/><br/>She likes to joke when she tells you her bedtime stories... saying how she carries a shotgun on her at all times in case intruders try to steal her recipe!! Grandma does make you laugh, you love her silly stories!<br/><br/><strong>The Game</strong><br/><br/><br/>So how do you play Grandma's Footsteps?<br/><br/>Grandma's house is made up of 6 different rooms (levels). To unlock the next room along you will need to approach grandma in the current room you are in to receive a cookie!<br/><br/>But Grandma is always on the look out for intruders after her secret cookie recipe! <br/><br/>Grandma isn't wearing her glasses, meaning she cannot see her Grandson properly... So when she turns around... don't move, or else her bedtime stories you so well know and love, may just become reality...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T04:09:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d14/d146d7682c7589933967de7c24fd9e61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grumpy Crumpet"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Grumpy Crumpet"], "esrb_rating": null}
