This game was supposed to be a Sonic-esque platformer with Mario elements. The game\u00a0was supposed to release on 2018 but development soon halted because of the awful platforming physics I created, and I never use the Game Maker to make a game from scratch again since then.\u00a0</p><p>This prototype only contains a single platforming level with nothing in it. Superfish always bounces on the ground and I don't know how to fix it + I have sxxtload of schoolworks to do, so it was cancelled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you ever want to use my crappy engine to make a platformer, make sure to credit me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All musics are from Sonic 2 HD.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fc/4fc5d0c014b6a4bbac63c29b95e0592b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superfish the Human"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
