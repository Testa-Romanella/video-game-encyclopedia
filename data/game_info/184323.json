Now contains nouns which were originally missing and fixes the now-notorious sub ocean issue.</p>\n<p>I have <strong>not</strong> intentionally tried to make a bad game, but that said, I'm not really a programmer. I'm a streamer. You can watch me play (usually much better games than this) at https://twitch.tv/CalAlaera and, if you want to support me, please click the support link above, or patronise me at https://patreon.com/CalAlaera.</p>\n<p>I <strong>have</strong>, on the other hand, intentionally made some... shall we say, rather questionable design choices. Also, where things have gone wrong in amusing ways, I have left them in. For example, the fact that itchio cut off the top and right of the logo amuses me, so I've left it that way. My name is listed twice in the game for similar reasons.</p>\n<p>Now available: Game of the Year Edition DLC! Conveniently bundled with your game but locked behind a \"pay\" wall, all three DLC items are now available in a single package for a low low price! Download the ZIP and follow the included instructions. The lowest price itchio will allow me to set that isn't zero is $1, and I don't feel comfortable charging $1 for it, so... name your own price!</p>\n<p><strong>\"Praise\" for this \"Game\":</strong><br/><em>\"That was certainly, by some definitions, a game\" \u2014 Phillammon<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Important note: This \"game\" is not approved, authorised, or endorsed by PepsiCo, Bionic Trousers Media Inc, or Hormel Foods Corporation.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a0/7a0d54c33e223a882d8038f92a6bfa4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CalAlaera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
