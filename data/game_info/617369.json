By Guillermo Ojeda Noda (@kek1us) and Daniel Otero Avalle (@aceitedegrifosol).</p>\n<p>The gameplay is designed around the wonky physics and the challenges derived from controlling two characters (one with each hand) at the same time. Baked into the game's core is the idea that the box can only be hoisted if the two characters\u00a0are connected to it. The box movement is computed with the forces that both characters\u00a0are applying in their pulling efforts. If one character gets too far away from the box, its connection gets broken and the box gets stuck until the partnering connection gets reestablished.\r\n</p>\n<p>We completely brought this one up in the 48hrs of the Game Jam. We used Unity as the game engine. All the 3D models have been created inside Unity. The levels were created with the in-engine tool ProBuilder and the textures were hand-drawn in Krita.\r\n</p>\n<p>As used assets, we got the music and sound effects from a Humble Bundle that Guillermo got last year. Additionally we used the following public font: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Belligerent-Madness</p>\n<p>P.S.: Additionaly, there is a dancefloor to flex your moves!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:17:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/976447a3a1eb6bdb4d596dea6c0aafe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Guillermo Ojeda Noda", "Daniel Otero Avalle"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
