Our development team has retained the simplicity and minimalism that made the original so great, while including exciting new features.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\r\nGame now available for free on the Google Play Store.\r\n<p>Balls now come in three colors:\u00a0<br/><br/>&gt; White Ball: the standard, garden-variety, vanilla ball. Grants +3 to the player if successfully shot behind the enemy player.<br/><br/>&gt; Green Ball: green is good. Grants +1 to the player if let into his/her 'Dead Zone'.<br/><br/>&gt; Red Ball: hands off these guys. Deducts 1 point from the player who touches a Red Ball. Despawns after contact or after 6 bounces .<br/><br/>In addition, there are currently three gamemodes:<br/><br/>&gt; STANDARD: gain 50 points against the Computer;<br/><br/>&gt; SURVIVAL: try to hold out against increasingly larger hordes of Balls. Watch out though. If the enemy gets more than a 20-point lead on you, it's Game Over.\u00a0<br/><br/>&gt; SUDDEN DEATH: survive against a devastatingly fast Computer. In addition, the longer you stay alive, the faster the ball becomes. As soon as you let the ball in, it's Game Over!<br/><br/>More features will be implemented in future updates. Let us know if you encounter any bugs or would like to suggest a new feature. We are more than happy to take on any constructive advice. Thanks for playing!<br/></p>\n<p><em>- Fagerstrom 'n' Strong Dev Team</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/82997e8e944e8770e0b1a3475deb0e7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fagerstrom 'n' Strong"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
