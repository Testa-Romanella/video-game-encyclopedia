You can buy, breed and sell bugs to create the perfect bug that will corrupt the simulation and let you escape.</p>\n<p>Each bugs has:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A body</strong>. The more colors are present in its body, the higher its value. A bug with 15 different colors is the perfect bug that will corrupt reality and let you escape.</li><li><strong>Energy</strong> (hearts). Generating new bugs will cost a heart. Feeding the bug will give one heart back. A bug with full energy (3/3) cannot be fed again and it cannot alter reality.</li><li><strong>Positive/negative genes</strong>: each bug has three genes which can give a positive (green triangles), negative (red triangles) or negligible (grey dash) impact on your reality. A bug with positive genes will do what it can to improve your account balance and improve your luck. The opposite is true for bugs with negative genes.</li></ul>\n<p> Commands:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Buy</strong>: It will take you to the store where you can buy new bugs with your money.</li><li><strong>Sel</strong>l: It will let you sell one of your bugs in exchange for money.</li><li><strong>Breed</strong>: At the price of 50$ you can choose two bugs that will generate a new one.</li><li><strong>Feed</strong>: at the price of 5$/bug you you will be able to alter reality using your bugs. Bugs can have positive or negative effects on your life. They could make you more lucky or more unlucky, change your account balance and change the bugs you can find at the store.</li></ul>\n<p>Remember, if you are lucky you will find bugs with positive attitudes in the store. And don't let your account balance reach 0$.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T08:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bfae913a0bd59465050b88631743dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alisamalb"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
