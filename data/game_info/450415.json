As of v1.0, this game can be played on any browser (except Safari) and on any Desktop or PC computer. Dodge the Creeps was made completing a Godot tutorial (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html). However, features coming in the future will include:</p>\n<p>- Establishing a login system (only username)<br/>- Keeping a Scoreboard of the top five players (with their usernames) who have survived the longest amount of time<br/>\u00a0 (and\u00a0 maybe their levels)<br/>- Add increasing levels of difficulty (i.e. level 1, the mobs will be much slower but after a timed interval, their speed will<br/>\u00a0 increase to speeds never seen before as you progress to the next level! Can you survive the mob?!?!)<br/>- Add some more colors (or maybe backgrounds) to each different level instead of the bland gray-ish background<br/>- Migration of the game to play online on mobile devices<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy the Game and thanks for playing! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T02:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/2050f6138e162fb3798a3d8dcc95190b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jeff_ridgeway"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
