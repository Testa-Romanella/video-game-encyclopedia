Expand your newly founded colony's footprint. Avoid underground hazards. Through mining, provide materials for building new colony structures. Earn money to upgrade your drillship. Manage your drillship's fuel, health, and cargo during extended mining expeditions.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tTunnel Lords is a one player, 2D vertically scrolling, real time mining game. Mine 10 different minerals, including  2 radioactive minerals. Use 8 different buildings. Some buildings require initial construction by the player. Many buildings may be upgraded through contributing minerals.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tUpgrade your drillship's hull, fuel tank, cargo hold, and radiator to delve deeper underground. Use your drillship's onboard thrusters to return to the surface after productive mining runs. Don't get greedy and stay in the mines too long or you may lose your life to lack of fuel. Avoid differing hazards in the mine or suffer catastrophic hull compromise.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Input<p>\r\n\tGame input fully supports both Xbox Game Pad and Keyboard. In Game Input cues (keyboard or game pad) are based off the device used to access the main menu but may be changed on the options screen later.</p><p>Non Xbox compatible controllers may be used to play the game With the TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator. See http://www.x360ce.com/ for details. X360CE is not included with the game and must be installed manually.

Please keep in mind, Tunnel Lords is programmed by one individual and I have no formal training in software accessibility.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tConcerns for someone with disabilities:\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Does not require sound to play.</li>\n<li>Tunnel Lords Supports the built in Windows On-Screen Keyboard. </li>\n<li>Unfortunately, there is no way to remap keyboard controls.</li><li>Gamepad controls may not be remapped directly in game. however, Tunnel Lords is compatible with TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator, which allows remapping gamepad controls externally to the game. See input section for details. http://www.x360ce.com/</li>\n</ul><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Age &amp; Content Considerations<p>\r\n\tTunnel Lords has not been reviewed by a formal ratings board like ESRB, PEGI, or ACB. However, Tunnel Lords does not contain any sexual overtones or foul language. There is no violence except for the destruction of your drillship when losing the game.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tContent wise, we would have no problem letting a young child play Tunnel Lords. A child younger than about five years old would have difficulty understanding and mastering the game mechanics.</p><p> <br/>\n</p>Transferring from Demo to Full Version <p>The full version and demo of Tunnel Lords are separate installers. By default, the full version installs on top of the demo, so it will not be necessary to uninstall the demo version. All saved games will be preserved and available when upgrading from the demo to the full version. </p>Credits<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tProgrammed by: <strong>Brett Woodard</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n\tGraphics by: <strong>Tabitha Woodard</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\r\n\tMusic &amp; Sound by: <strong>Eric Woodard</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Special Thanks: <strong>Katie, Shelley-Marie, Jonathan, Rachel, Casey</strong></li>\n</ul>Troubleshooting<br/><p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> After installing, the screen resolution is set inappropriately, or the game crashes.</p><ol><li>If you can navigate to the options menu, attempt to change the screen resolution or change from full screen to windowed mode. </li><li>If unable to navigate to the options menu, manually change the screen resolution or change from full screen to windowed mode in the Settings.txt file.
