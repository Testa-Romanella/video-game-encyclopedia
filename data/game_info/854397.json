Congratulations! Students have been going missing for the past several weeks, but don't worry about that. Just do a good job and pay no attention to any odd happenings in the hallways. It's just your imagination. Who is responsible for these missing teenagers? Is the kidnapper still in the school. Is it you?<br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong> <br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong> A first-person walking simulator with some puzzle-solving elements. Walk, walk briskly, crouch, inspect items, take items into inventory, consume some items, vacuum, clean, repair certain items and areas. Night Janitor is a mix of horror and cleaning elements. In one scene, you get to vacuum up and entire basketball court riddled with confetti and it is SO satisfying!<br/><br/><strong>Psychological Horror:</strong>  Since you play a janitor, you will also be able to do things like vacuum up debris, scrub mirrors, and other custodial duties.<br/><br/><strong>Two Endings:</strong> A good ending and a bad ending. Figure out how to accomplish each one.<br/><br/>Night Janitor is a fairly short game. It should be completed within 1 - 2 hours, depending on your play style.<br/><br/>Based on experiences as a night janitor in creepy buildings.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T04:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b8/9b8929296aa719e0c3886bc03554bdd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["batwimp"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["batwimp"], "esrb_rating": null}
