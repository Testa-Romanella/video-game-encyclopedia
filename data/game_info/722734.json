The only thing you have to do during the game is to select a column and click the left mouse button to lift the top same-colored gems in that column, then move the mouse to the other column and click to drop them. Whenever you stack three or more gems of the same level on top of each other, you will harvest a higher level gem. The highest level gem you have collected will be displayed in the top left corner, and for every four moves you make during this period, a random row of gems will fall from above, and the highest level of this random row will be the same as the level in the top left corner. There are 8 levels of gems in this game, with the highest level being Diamond. When you have seven gems in a column at the same time it will flash red, if you accumulate more than seven the game will be over.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:34:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0df/0df4e437cac8672902f6afa827ac89c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tli008"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
