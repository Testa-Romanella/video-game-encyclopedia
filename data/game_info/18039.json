The protagonist is an inept knight who wears a suit of plate armor that isn't quite up to the task. Exiled from his kingdom, he must find the holy grail if he is to return. He is usually too busy fending off pests to worry about actual combat.  Many floors filled with vermin, hazards, and bosses to stumble your way through.<br/><br/>Now includes the playable mage DLC.<br/><br/>Links:<br/><strong>Global Achievements<br/>Global Leaderboards</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T18:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dba/dba5793ada972ce3389f61891939f68b.jpg", "website": "https://wastebasketgames.itch.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 137, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Kirk Tindell"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wastebasket Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
