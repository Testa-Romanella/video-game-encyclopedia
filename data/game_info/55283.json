It is the fifth and final game in the Game Boy version of the original Mega Man series. The game follows the adventures of the protagonist Mega Man as he must defend the Earth from a group of powerful robots from outer space called the \"Stardroids\". Mega Man V was also unique from the previous Game Boy Mega Man games as it features original and unique bosses rather than recycling those from the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games.</p>\n<p>Mega Man V is an action platformer in which the player selects stages in a non-linear fashion and acquires the weapon of each boss defeated to use as their own. Although it plays nearly identical to any other games in the series, Mega Man V features a new default weapon (the powerful \"Mega Arm\") and introduces Tango, a new assistant character. Mega Man V received an average to positive critical reception. In 2013, Mega Man V was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T10:32:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39b9d35727e8a89be7d7eaba035062d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 263, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Game Boy", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Minakuchi Engineering"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
