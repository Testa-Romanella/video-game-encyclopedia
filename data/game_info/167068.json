The code is included as a .unitypackage if you want to have a go at hacking something similar together yourself.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2d/a2dc7043e9a28b7b10c63518587b3e1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Snozbot"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
