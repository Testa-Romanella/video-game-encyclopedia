Use left analog stick to move, right to aim the\u00a0flashlight. Enemies cannot detect you when your light is off, so turn it off or dim it (right trigger)\u00a0to sneak past them.

Every level is randomly generated and\u00a0each consecutive level played without dying adds more enemies. Good Luck!</p><p><strong>Theme:</strong></p><p>This game adheres to the theme \u201chidden\u201d in two ways.
