{"id": 731394, "slug": "superposed-cat", "name": "SUPERPOSED CAT", "name_original": "SUPERPOSED CAT", "description": "<p>This game is developed for the\u00a0Global Game Jam for 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Play as Schrodinger's Cat, a curious creature that when unobserved exists in a state of superposition, both alive and dead until observed. Solve the puzzles and escape the box. Instructions: When unobserved you play as both cat and ghost, each with their own special abilities. Cat operates with WASD keys or left stick on gamepad. Ghost operates with mouse movement or right stick on gamepad. Observations of the box/maze will shift the cat into one of the observed states based on the radiation/danger level shown by the geiger counter. Abilities: Observed cat is fast and can push large boxes. Observed ghost can absorb radiation from radioactive sources. When in superposition cat is weaker/slower and can only push small boxes. Ghost can possess creatures but can no longer absorb.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d2/0d2f212953bb7e71d945bbce77679ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["tachyonFlux", "egarland0", "nomnomdoom", "alipphardt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
