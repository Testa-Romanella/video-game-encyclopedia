Green enemy -&gt; shoot with green gun and so on. HP will be restored in each new room. Short game (~15 min), it will just end when you go into the last room. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>P.S. Didn't really finished it in time, so I needed another ~6 hours to maked it done after the jams' end. I wanted to implement shaders, slow-mo, bosses, but I stopped it right there so it will stay as prototype and not as demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-25T03:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcc/bcc7e41e7a49f8f4c7d3175288e6862c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calvares"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
