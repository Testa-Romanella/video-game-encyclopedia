It was inspired by games like Silent Hill and Re7. The goal of the game is to find all 4 keys scattered around a dark foggy Victorian town while also trying to survive against Victorian urban legend monsters. The player is equipped with a slow reloading musket so they must time their shots and aim accurately to be able to take down the various monsters that lurk The Town. (Tip: aim for the head, some enemies will go down with one shot and others with two if shot in the head). Beware that some powerful enemies can kill you in one hit. Thank you for trying out my first mini game, feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31acbf6be9fdfe03b021348c771371bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cpena2031"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
