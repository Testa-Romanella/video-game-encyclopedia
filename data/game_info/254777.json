These players are randomly divided into alignments \u2013 Town, Mafia, Coven, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains. The catch? You don\u2019t know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly work against the town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T22:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01b/01bcd984e5a747221109698768312067_JX1NkAN.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["BlankMediaGames"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["BlankMediaGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
