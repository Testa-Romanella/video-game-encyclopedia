{"id": 428795, "slug": "goblin-times", "name": "Goblin Times", "name_original": "Goblin Times", "description": "\u201cGoblin times\u201d is a turn-based strategy game mixed with RPG elements. There are five kinds of sources: gold, food, staff, reputation and happiness. Players could use these sources to produce units, build constructions, develop policies, and pay the price for map mechanism and random incidents. The map is in tiles. You could move the leader and their units across the tiles and order workers to build constructions in tiles. Every unit is able to level up and buy equipment to strengthen themselves.<br/>In the current version, there are 8 different forces for players to choose. They are able to control a leader who is on behalf of certain force to explore, expand, exploit and exterminate.<br/>Of course players could also choose their own winning strategies by highest reputation, possess rare resources, or just up take down their opponents by force. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Leaders with different abilities and up to their own games</h3><br/><ul><li>Bomb girls \u2013They are the most shining stars in this goblin world, leading everyone to a beautiful new world and supported by numerous followers in the general public.

These two masterpieces portray the ugly side of capitalism thoroughly with a comic and satiric style, and still remain entertaining at the same time. As a big advocate of socialism, I always have a special place in my heart for this kind of films. <br/>On the other hand, as a gamer who is incredibly into 4X games such as \u201cSid Meier's Civilization\u201d, I always dreamt of making a game of the same genre for my own entertainment. And as time went by, the day finally came. As I encountered a game called \u201cGremlins inc\u201d which was right up my ally and served as a huge inspiration to me. That\u2019s when I really took action and started to design and develop a strategy game with a sense of black humor.<br/>The game right now is still in development cause it\u2019s a two-man project and we\u2019ve got so much to learn and explore.
