The game has three endings and took a total of two days to make. It should be noted however, that this game does contain a LOT of swearing and some cartoon gore, so if either of those things make you uncomfortable, I'd recommend skipping out on this one. Also should be noted that this IS a fangame. I do not own Popee the Performer, and I do not make any money off of this. If you would like to give money to me, however, I'd suggest giving me a donation on my other game, The Girl in my Dreams. You don't have to, but it'd make my day if you did, so please consider it!</p>\n<p>Also uh yeah I made everything in this game. The art, music, ect was all made by me. The only thing that wasn't made by me are the characters, which belong to Ryuji Masuda. So, uh, yuh</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2be/2be036c419a27da1757ed580c715959a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pixel_Sapphire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
