You can dodge, fire, fool AI cannon on the ground, and your ultimate goal is to land on Earth!</p>\n<p>This game is a tribute to the arcade classic 'Space Invaders', but in this \"reversed\" version, you actually ARE the invaders!<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/>\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The invasion fleet will have a default movement and fire pattern like in original \"Space Invaders\" game. For example, the invaders' speed increases when there remain only few invaders.</p>\n\n<p>- To force your move to left or right, press LEFT or RIGHT cursor keys. <br/>- To fire extra missiles (and even BIG missiles), press X key.<br/></p>\n<p>These actions have a cost. You will need energy to perform them.<br/>On the top of the screen, you can see your energy bar. Any forced move or fire will consume some energy. But don't worry! If you release the keys the invaders will resume their default move and action.<br/></p>\n<p><big><strong>Strategy </strong>: Use wisely your dodging abilities and try not to waste your fire power!</big><br/><br/></p>\r\nSpecial rewards\r\n<p>If you manage to neutralize the ground cannon, you'll get an extra bonus!</p>\n<p>Any successful landing will also give you some extra points, and even more if you land on the ground with a significant number of invaders.</p>\r\nCan you invade the Earth? \r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 <br/></p>\r\nHighscores and stats\r\n<p>Here are my best scores and some statistics.
