Test your concoctions on Roger, a friendly, sentient test dummy. Take notes on the walls of your workshop using Draw Mode, or doodle to your heart's content!<br/><br/>You won't be mindlessly testing combinations, though. There is a rhyme and reason to it all, transforming the game into a massive logic puzzle for you to solve at your own pace. <br/><br/>Use the money you earn from potion deliveries to buy cosmetics for your shop, and hang gifts from the villagers on your walls. <br/><br/>Mangrove has small town drama out the wazoo, with rival gangs, forbidden love, and a contentious mayoral election. Meet a large cast of wacky characters, including tatted up fairies, potted plants, and the Mafishioso. Serve your customers correctly and you'll get paid, but consider your choices carefully. Which potions you brew for which people will determine your path forward, and which of 27 different endings you'll get. <br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/>- Over 100 unique potions combinations<br/>- 27 different ending variations<br/>- A funky 26 song soundtrack<br/>- Adorable hand drawn assets<br/>- 16 weirdos to meet<br/>- Free workshop kitty friend<br/><br/>Come visit Mangrove today!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-08T05:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec883dd8be8f391773ce112edfc2448.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Forget Me Not Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forget Me Not Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
