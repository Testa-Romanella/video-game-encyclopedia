The game is about using a spaceship to fight aliens - but here's the catch, you cannot move up or down and you need to dodge tons of meteorites. The game will be updated. This game also has a storyline but it has not been merged into the game. It is a separate button (sorry for that, should be updated).</p>\n<p>Credits to the entire Microbyte Arts team working on this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/066dead883b030633c8515bcb3f74a42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["MicrobyteArts"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
