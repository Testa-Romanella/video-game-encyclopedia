Keep your distance to keep people alive!</p>\n<p>There are people walking around, hoping to get the item they need, once they got it, they\u2019ll head home quickly. Your mission is to help them get what they need, while maintaining their distance between each other in order to reduce the risks of spreading virus! Act as quickly as you can to help people stay apart!</p>\r\nLudum Dare 46\r\n<p>This is my first Ludum Dare, I have learned a lot working solo and in a limited amount of time! I do want to draw more art assets of my own and animate them, as well as make more levels with different variations, sadly there\u2019s not enough time. Hopefully next time I can work a lot quicker!</p>\n<ul><li>Tools: Unity, Adobe Illustrator, Krita, Garageband (first time creating music &amp; SFX by myself, it was fun!), BFXR</li></ul>\n<p>The gameplay is quite basic, but\u00a0I feel proud nonetheless, as everything comes together quite well!</p>\n<p>For the theme \u201cKeep it alive\u201d, I thought about various ideas but decided to make something related to what we are facing right now - the covid-19. However, as this is happening around the world and many people are having a difficult time, I decided to not emphasize on any kind of death in the game.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for playing, let us all stay healthy and play games! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4b/a4b72810a86caffe324ba234c9fcbbb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xeniaeo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
