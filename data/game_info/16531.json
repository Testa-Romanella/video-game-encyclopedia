{"id": 16531, "slug": "majestic-nights", "name": "Majestic Nights", "name_original": "Majestic Nights", "description": "Majestic Nights is an episodic action-adventure-thriller set in an alternate 1980s where all conspiracy theories, past and present, are True. <br/><br/>You play as Cardholder: an intelligence operative who may or may not have been present at or even responsible for many of the biggest conspiracy events in history; and Cal, a humble Private Investigator whose own past is shrouded in secrets unknown even to herself. <br/><br/>With fast, light mechanics, the game has been developed to engross players in a shadowy world of conspiracy with an over-the-top 1980s aesthetic. Players will use wits, stealth and sometimes even a little force to investigate, explore, and acquire ever more clues for their big string-covered wall of conspiracies. <br/><br/>Season One of Majestic Nights takes place over six chapters, which work as a complete story or as standalone experiences. \u2018Chapter Zero\u2019, a prologue to the series, will be made available for free. Each subsequent chapter of the core series will be paid, and season passes will also be available.<br/><br/>Feature List<br/><ul><li>Isometric Action Adventure Gameplay<br/></li><li>Real-time stealth and combat mechanics<br/></li><li>Investigate and collect evidence to reveal the Truth<br/></li><li>Big hair!<br/></li><li>A vibrant alternative 1980s setting<br/></li><li>A world full of conspiracy theories and government plots where everything you know is wrong<br/></li><li>Controller support for platforms including PC, Mac<br/></li><li>Nazi aliens!<br/></li><li>A gripping, six episode story<br/></li><li>Alternate story paths to explore<br/></li><li>Puzzles, minigames and more!<br/></li><li>Kick-ass original 1980s soundtrack<br/></li><li>\u2018Chapter Zero\u2019, a prologue to the core season, will be available free before launch<br/></li><li>More Truth than any other game!<br/></li><li>Season Pass will be available on all platforms (and comes with the soundtrack!)<br/></li><li>Steam Achievements<br/></li><li>Keytars<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": 32, "released": "2014-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T11:10:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/752/752a1771fcf4febb0befd560fcaa524c.jpg", "website": "http://www.majesticnights.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 130}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 53, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Epiphany Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Epiphany Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
