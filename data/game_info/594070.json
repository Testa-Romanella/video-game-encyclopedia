{"id": 594070, "slug": "no25-universe-prototype", "name": "No.25 Universe (Prototype)", "name_original": "No.25 Universe (Prototype)", "description": "<p>On July 9, 1968, four male rats and four female rats were put into space with no natural enemies, no diseases, no hunger, and no housing problems. They are Adam and Eve in this utopian world of 2.57 meters in length and width and 1.37 meters in height. They divide their territories, choose mates, mate, and multiply. After all the preparatory work was over, John Calhoun's population decay experiment quietly started. No.25 Universe opens.<br/></p>\n<p>On the 104th day of Universe Experiment 25, the first batch of newborn rats was born. In the subsequent period from the 100th to the 300th day, the population of rats will double every 55 days, and everything seems to be proceeding in this new world in an orderly manner.</p>\n<p>But as time passed by, things that the scientists of Universe 25 hadn't anticipated happened one after another. From the data analysis, it should be the period with the highest birth rate of rats within 86-338 days. What is interesting is that although all territories are divided equally from the center in a radial pattern, the number of rats born in each territory is relatively large. difference.</p>\n<p>In a brand new universe, the weak and the strong still exist, and the uneven distribution of resources is clearly visible. The strong are always strong, constantly expanding their territory and increasing the population of the ethnic group. The weak are always weak, and they can only stay safe. Those who are not favored by the opposite sex have to guard against the invasion of mice from other territories at any time, surviving in fear and helplessness.</p>\n<p>Originally an average world that excludes all objectively existing interference factors, it has become the best experimental model for the weak and the strong. Is it an accidental irony or an inevitable result?</p>\n<p>But this is only the beginning. With the end of the population explosion period, the No. 25 experimental universe has entered a slow period. However, the test base, which could hold the upper limit of 6,000, was fully loaded when the population had not exceeded 2,000.</p>\n<p>Although there is no shortage of space and food in Universe 25, a space called \"Social Responsibility\" has been carved up. Adult mice inherit the status and responsibilities of their parents and become the main force in defending the territory and reproducing the ethnic group. However, the position of the main force is limited after all. Adult mice that are not recognized and included in it will move outward, and they can only find their own new living environment if they lose their self-worth. Then the central resource area will become a new stronghold.</p>\n<p>The mice gradually began to lose interest in life and care too much about survival. There is no communication, no interaction, indifference, and exclusion have become the norm, and violence and anger have gradually increased. Rats that usually disturb other \"cohabitants\" just because they come back from eating will be attacked. The attacked person will not evade or resist. They will be driven to a more remote corner, but the next time other rats disturb their tranquility, the former victims will show their aggressiveness and transform into a new one. The perpetrator of the wheel.</p>\n<p>As the number of mice with nowhere to go is increasing, the territorial consciousness of the males who take up the job of protecting the territory is getting weaker and weaker. As the concept of territories faded away, the female rats responsible for nurturing became more aggressive, and even directly replaced the male rats who were supposed to be responsible for protecting territories. This kind of aggression is not only for outsiders, but the female rats' aggression has been transferred to their offspring horribly. Many young rats that have not been weaned have also become targets of female rats and have even been expelled from the nest. The dislocation of the relationship between men and women, the chaos of social relations, the decline in conception rates, and the almost complete cessation of fertility. The sinking of this society has already begun. And all of this seems to point to Universe No. 25, which is about to reach its end.</p>\n<p>On May 23, 1973, with the death of the last male rat, Universe 25 declared complete death.</p>\n<p>In fact, although the object of the experiment on the 25th Universe is a mouse, everything seems to be able to explain many common problems in human society. The fallacy of absolute egalitarianism, the importance of the relationship between men and women, the distribution of social responsibilities, the importance of social distance, and so on.</p>\n<p>My game is called Universe 25, which seems to herald the failure of the previous 24 universes. In such a world, the new history and the new settings are no longer restricted by the existing historical framework, no longer by the differences between Chinese and Western historical and cultural backgrounds. Different heroes gather in the same time and space, and our protagonist will also start his own adventure on this continent to find his own value of existence.</p>\n<p>And the observers and creators of this world also seem to be looking forward to a good show...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/17469b9d0bcb4d5855c5c5616a83711d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeddyWang"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
