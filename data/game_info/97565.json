Stoic, closed off and guarded, she veers away from people as much as possible. The only thing that bothers her is how people say her artwork often \"has no soul\" to it\" and are \"beautiful, but not moving.\"</p>\n<p>Very soon, she crosses paths with Kou, a cheerful and outgoing boy who says he has to \"join the art club NO MATTER WHAT\". His desperation sickens her, as he seems one of those aloof geniuses and she doesn't want her hard work to be outdone by someone so mindless.</p>\n<p>But as time passes and they interact will things get better?</p>\n<p>Will the mere presence of him not cause her to roll her eyes or scoff anymore?</p>\n<p>Will she be able to quell her first instinct, which is to punch him in the gut every time he flashes that cocky grin?</p>\n<p>Will she be able to infuse 'soul' in her artwork?</p>\n<p>And why does he have such strangely coloured eyes?</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/><strong>Le awesome Silveth who cranked out super awesome cute chibis.
