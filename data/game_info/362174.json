Artificer's Apprentice is based on the bones of a pen-and-paper RPG I was making a while ago, where the main mechanic was this modular gun system. I've stripped it down to one gun.</p>\n<p>How does \"only one\"\u00a0play into this? it doesn't The main idea of the world this takes place in (which is actually a fantasy world I've been building with some significant liberties) is that all energy is actually one thing. It can be converted to the one common form, mana, and converted back to blow up monsters(or like, better humanity or something). You also only have one weapon, which you have to modify a lot.</p>\n<p>PLEASE PLEASE read all the .txt files included in the download! They have the story and controls and such in it.</p>\n<p>If you liked the game, please give me a good score! I'm much more proud about this game than my last entry...</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes the spell won't show up in the world. Don't worry, it's still firing.</li>\n<li>Monsters turn funny colors. some of this is status effects, and some of it is bugs.</li>\n<li>Very occasionally, the world may generate in such a way you can't make it through the level. Sorry... 'Tis the weakness of random generation.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T02:00:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/11446971c3c567b930d5c433b9b6bd99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["gamma_delta"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
