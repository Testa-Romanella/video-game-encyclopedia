Play as Nyah and her spirit light in tandem as you immerse yourself in this foreboding, atmospheric landscape. Will Nyah use her new found light to find her way home or will she lose her way amongst the many dangers that roam in the moonlight?<br/></p>\n<p>S<strong>imple Controls, Complex Gameplay:</strong><br/>Nyah can walk on the ground and collect treasures while her light can fly in any direction - you control them both at the same time. Forming a telekinetic beam between them, you\u2019ll create a powerful connection that can swing Nyah to new heights, destroy barriers, thwart spirits and light the way to secret locations. Your coordination with these two characters is key, as disembodied spirits can appear without warning and hurt Nyah or her light. You\u2019ll learn their unique play style intuitively and quickly as fresh challenges emerge to test you in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>\n<br/><strong><br/>Discover Dozens of Unique Items</strong><br/>Collect dozens of unique treasures in Nyah's lunchbox that reveal memories from Nyah\u2019s past and rearrange them however you like. Decide which items to keep with you on your journey and which to offer to the mysterious spirit cat Roadkill, who can unlock secret challenge levels with special items.\r\n<br/><br/><strong>Awards!</strong>\n<br/><strong>FINALIST -</strong>\u00a0Indiecade 2018\r\n<br/><strong>OFFICIAL SELECTION -</strong>\u00a0The Mix at GDC and E3 2018\r\n<br/><strong>CROWDFUNDED -</strong>\u00a0by 315 backers on Fig 2017\r\n<br/><strong>OFFICIAL SELECTION -\u00a0</strong>Fantastic Arcade 2016\r\n<br/><strong>BEST PLATFORMER</strong>\u00a0- Intel Level Up 2016\r\n<br/><strong>SPOTLIGHT</strong>\u00a0- Indie Game Tasting 2016</p>\n<p>Stream or download the original soundtrack on Bandcamp.</p>\n<p>by\u00a0Buddy System, a small bedroom-studio team from LA.
