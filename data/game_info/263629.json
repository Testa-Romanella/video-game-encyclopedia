DO NOT engage with this game if you only have one controller to smash, have neighbors who don't like to hear cursing, or have a weak heart.\r\n\r\nCan you evolve from a simple circle to scale a tower and save...well, whoever is crying out for help at the top?\r\n\r\nBeneath the simple graphics lies an old-school, 2D platformer.\r\n-Find and evolve new forms and attacks that help you get past enemies and obstacles as you scale the tower\r\n-Many rooms, hidden secrets, and unlockable characters\r\n-Starts off easy and then ramps up the challenge.  Hope you have quick fingers.\r\n-If you reach the top of the tower...well, is it the end of the game, or just the beginning?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b664502cdd44d80e69c053065d3891f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
