Your friend lost forgot his homework assignments at school and he asked you to go and get them. But Chaffy likes to give his students math questions, because he says himself, \"Math is like medicine, it helps you work.\" Get 3 questions correct and you'll earn a prize! Collect all of your friend's seven papers and exit Chaffy's school to win.</p>\n\r\nNotes about the mod:\r\n<p>Sorry that there is only 3 colors of wall and only the Blue Brick Wall uses the door and window textures, I was too lazy, I made the Light Blue and Purple Walls last minute.\u00a0The title buttons are kind of in weird positions of the screen, I don't know why. And, for some reason you can't pick up any of the items in the shop.</p>\r\nCredits (Youtube Channels):\r\n<p>Tanner Jones - Official Comeback for the Tanner Poster, and his character.
