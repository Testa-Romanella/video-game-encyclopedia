I pray that cancer may spread and AIDs persist.<br/><br/>Holding out to the brink of decency, an article of utter reprehensibility! What\u2019s so absurd about the suburbs? The women who live like the roaches and rats, the creatures of basic trash! It\u2019s Absurbia: A Trashy Satire of Suburban Outcries!<br/><br/>Join Lele and Laverne, two middle-class runaway hysterics, as they trudge their chic m\u00e9nage, for the deadly sake of their depraved lifestyles. Gawk and fall into a desperate outrage at the true freaks of nature, more disgusting and worth the title of a trash cavalcade, than that of cockroach-eaters, armpit-lickers, and fecal-bangers. Witness an underground garbage fest, that challenges the eccentrics of low-brow transgression and putridly cheap production, that borders unpalatable media, by any sensible rational being!<br/><br/>Play this trash-decadent, transgressively campy black comedy, the trashiest of all \u201centertainment\u201d genres, let it strip you senseless and berate you, with the pounding of wooden sticks and let it dowse you in ice-cold water, until you obey its smothering abuse! A feast of nonsensical gore and strange hyper-fetishized perversions! <br/><br/>See the desperation of human nature in this twiddling pretense of good taste. A heaping garbage truck of idiotic sewage, from trash writing, trash producing, and trash dialogue, it\u2019s a trash epic! Experience genuine trash in Absurbia. Artistic value, more like autistic value! Hahahaha!<br/><br/>Note: This game is a sound novel-type of visual novel, therefore it is rather text-heavy. If you dislike using your imagination, then go away. The game's story and themes are meant to invoke disgust, annoyance, and/or anger, at times presenting these ideas in a blithe or even comedic sense, as for farce or anti-comedy. If you are uncomfortable by societal transgressions or confronting these, then just gift this to someone you hate.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T03:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd9f66abfc67e1065a50b2a95211c6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Licking Vomit"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["A Pond of Blue"], "esrb_rating": null}
