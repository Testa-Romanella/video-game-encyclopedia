{"id": 847115, "slug": "home-by-the-river-demo", "name": "Home By The River Demo", "name_original": "Home By The River Demo", "description": "<p>Home By The River is a beautiful\u00a02D side scroller sandbox that is about building, cleaning up pollution, gaining virtue, earning income, and advancing your clean reactor technology to bring peace and prosperity to mankind. You can play single player or LAN co-op!</p>\n<p>This is a demo version of the game which limits your player to level 5. The level of the player determines what tiles you have access to for placing in the world. The full game will be releasing as an Early Access title on Steam mid November 2022.</p>\n<p>My objective as the developer is to give you an environment that you can make beautiful and relax in. Home By The River is being developed by one person, Looqmaan aka Gamer To Game Developer, and it is the most meaningful game to me that I have ever worked on, and a full time job for me. I hope that I will produce something that I will always be happy about and that I can be happy and proud to show others. Home By The River is the first project that delights my heart whenever I work on it and I do hope I'll keep on developing this for years and years to come.\u00a0I've changed my pathway and stopped making games with violence (yes I will get back to Weekend Drive and transform that in the future to a beautiful peaceful game I hope). I've been making games and teaching game development for ten years.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T12:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a406f81b65ef5e11a08fc75d8e671106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gamer To Game Developer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
