I remember he had some kind of cooking craze.\u201d<br/>\u201cI always thought he paints figurines. Once I saw him painting a family of gnomes. Or were they brownies?\u201d<br/>\u201cThey were orcs, Bob! An orc and his tribe. They wrote about those figurines in the Evening Chronicle. His orc took first place in a miniatures competition, and he won a Traeger grill.\u201d<br/>\u201cThat\u2019s a great grill! Did I imagine it, Katie, or was that the doorbell?\u201d<br/>\u201cIt must be the postman!\u201d<br/><br/>It really was the postman, with a letter from their friends on the island.
