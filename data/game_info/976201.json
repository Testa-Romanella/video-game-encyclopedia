No memories, except of every video game you\u2019ve ever played. Jack into a wild night in a virtual world you\u2019ll never remember.<br/><br/>Armed with puns, pop culture, and a sharp dose of sarcasm, can you muddle your way through levels of satirical video game pastiches, back to reality?<br/><br/>Adventure through virtual worlds alongside a delusional gamer, an actual emo vampire (who really wishes he wasn\u2019t an emo vampire), a poet from outer space, and a dashing princess in shining armor, among others! And perhaps, just perhaps, learn a bit too much about the kind of person you are when the real world isn\u2019t watching.<br/><br/>A satire of the trapped-in-a-video-game genre, and a tragicomedy on the theme of dating sims.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t Wake Me Up is a 400,000-word interactive novel about love in video games, where your choices control the story. Entirely text-based, and driven by your imagination. It is written by Baudelaire Welch, a professional game screenwriter currently working as a companion character designer for RPGs.<br/><br/><ul><li>Play as nonbinary, male, female, straight or queer.<br/></li><li>Travel through 6 worlds inspired by different video game genres<br/></li><li>Wield a weaponised top hat<br/></li><li>Rack your brains in a spaceship escape level inspired by old-school adventure games<br/></li><li>Compete in a classical music-themed monster truck rally<br/></li><li>Lose yourself in a cyberpunk casino<br/></li><li>Date the Ultimate Video Game Fanservice Vampire<br/></li><li>Or, date the Ultimate Video Game \u2018Best Girl\u2019 Waifu<br/></li><li>A period piece honed in early 2010s internet cringe<br/></li><li>Bifurcates entirely halfway through the game based on your love interest.</li></ul><br/>Sometimes true love is a wrong dialogue choice.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T09:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b0/1b0b65a121b93055cdc7266b25f4e6cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hosted Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hosted Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
