It's not perfect, but I'm happy with what came out. It follows the general tutorials set out by GML when making <em>Space Rocks,\u00a0</em>but I wanted to make it just a tad\u00a0different with my own little twist. I already have plans for a sequel to it if people actually like the concept. Any advice or tips on how to improve are greatly appreciated. Also, if you do end up playing it, then thank you very much, and I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:57:43", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Praying Lotus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
