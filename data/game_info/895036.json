( I hope you don't mind playing non-fullscreen. There are currently issues when playing on full screen. However, if you find the tile breaking on a non-fullscreen, try zooming in / out your browser. Really sorry for that.)<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Something you may want to know:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>There is a total of 4 skills for the player to obtain, two movement skills and two combat skills.<br/>\n</li><li>Without complete movement skills, the player can get stuck. You can use teleportation in this case.<br/>\n</li><li>Activating the teleportation scroll will cost 5 blue crystals / 3 red crystals / 1 teal crystal. The player can still try to activate the scroll even without any crystals, however, there will be a 50% chance of fail activation.</li><li>Player attack priority is: enemy &gt; enemy projectile &gt; props.</li></ul>\n<p>Seem like my current skill isn't enough to complete the game within the given time. So you may find something unfitting, incomplete, some typos, and a forced story.\u00a0If you find any of that or if you\u00a0have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment, I will really appreciate that.</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p>Some of the art:</p>\n<ul><li>Ansimuz &gt;\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-caves</li><li>Penzilla &gt;\u00a0\u00a0https://penzilla.itch.io/hooded-protagonist</li><li>XYEzawr &gt;\u00a0https://xyezawr.itch.io/gif-free-pixel-effects-pack-5-blood-effects</li></ul>\n<p>Music &amp; some of the\u00a0\u00a0audio effect:</p>\n<ul><li>SVL &gt; https://svl.itch.io/rpg-music-pack-svl</li><li>Kenney &gt;\u00a0http://www.kenney.nl</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T11:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f40ead5eebedfb5dd4ca600565e23f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["copperfrog"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
