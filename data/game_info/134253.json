Having done so, Ukko now stands outside the cave scouting for a better place to settle down. He looks to the right and sees a big city partially hidden in its own pollution. It doesn't look inviting. But to the left there are green fields as far as he can see. Clearly that is the way he must go.</p><p>Ukko jumps onto a bicopter parked by the cave-entrance, and pedals up in the air! Now begins Ukko's Journey for a new and better place to settle down and live for the next many years.</p> Instructions <p>On your journey you must collect apples from the ground below with your net, by hovering low over the ground. Eat apples to gain energy, or throw them after birds and other obstacles, to avoid flying into them and lose energy. But remember you also need energy to pedal the bicopter, so don't throw away all your apples! Don't collect too many apples either, or else you will weigh too much to fly.</p><p>Good luck! You will need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f2/4f2059058b39985f4680aab2a1f7cd43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lubluent"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
