With more to come! &lt;----\u00a0(it\u00a0depends)<br/>\n</li><li>Stylized in gacha-game aesthetic, but without the gachas, or any fancy animations. You just get static PNG drawn by me.</li><li>Assemble not just one party, but your entire rosters! Every single character you recruit will have a job to do, either fighting in a squad or running solo mission.</li><li>Main gameplay loop is\u00a0sending your squads to run randomly generated maps for currency, akin to Path of Exile style of map grinding.</li><li>Micromanage multiple ongoing battles at once! Or go idle and\u00a0just let your squads handle themselves. Offline progress included, of course.<br/>\n</li><li>No prestiges, increments are tiny, but last forever.</li><li>Play casually, fire and forget once you had everything set up. Or dive deep into the theorycrafting hole, as you figure out which skill synergise with each other, or which characters complement one another.</li></ul>\n<p>This is a\u00a0sequel to\u00a0Idle Hamlet. Final release is planned on Android. For discussion, bug report, or just hanging out, join\u00a0the game\u00a0\u00a0Discord\u00a0server!</p>\n<p><em>***Saving file on web browser is not safe!
