I would like to thank Coursera, the other students who were with me along the 6 months course and of course the MSU instructors - Brian Winn and Casey O'Donnell - who provided the course material in fun and engaging ways. Cheers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/378def68c933c1d92d5b0193cac4e39d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Shenawy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
