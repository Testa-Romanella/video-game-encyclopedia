I have been been an active participant in several jams and collabs in the\u00a0Bitsy community, along with the Summer Slow Jams hosted by\u00a0PIGSquad!<br/><br/>Outside of the sphere of game development, I write stories, create worlds, draw, and sometimes make up stupid musical jingles about really stupid things.
