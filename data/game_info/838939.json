Then when you have the ingredients necessary for the dish, you toss them in the pumpkin pot that sits on the oven and wait for them to cook. If an angry robot comes out and tries to hurt you, DON'T PANIC! Just take your trusty chilly pepper and burn him until only the dish remains. After that serve the dish to the client and get rich! If you don't serve the correct order, or the client waits too long, they will take some of your money away. Remember that if you go in debt (i.e. your money is in the negatives), you lose. You can lose by dying too, but I think you know that already...</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0WASD - movement;</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0SPACE - interact with the fridge, or the bell that calls Bob;</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - fire the chilly pepper.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:24:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d63/d63f8f53177b2bc70fc2824032baf68e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snowing Clouds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
