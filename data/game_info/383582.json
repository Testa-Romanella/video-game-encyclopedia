Make wise decisions to use your time to it's fullest or face an insurmountable enemy as they grow stronger.<h3>Develop your base!</h3><br/>Acquire resources by exploring, fighting or mining and use them to upgrade your base. Construct new facilities to better train your officers, upgrade and modify your equipment, build new ship designs and research new technologies!<h3>Train your crew!</h3><br/>Your officers will gain new skills and traits as they gain experience. Some traits may be helpful such as allowing them to help another officer recover from an injury, while other traits may prove a hindrance. As your officers develop and become more powerful and valuable the risk of them facing a permanent death becomes more daunting. Once they're gone... they're gone.<h3>Make Friends or Foes!</h3><br/>You'll encounter many factions in MetaSpace and depending on your actions and decisions they may become a great ally or a terrible enemy. Attack enemy faction's outposts, fleets and transports to keep them under control and reduce their strength. Visit an allied faction's outposts and you'll be able to purchase their unique items, ship designs, officers and even hire a mercenary to fight alongside you.<h3>Highly Moddable</h3><br/>The same tools used to create content for the game are available to you!
