This was the first ever game I've written that's been hand coded. It was the first in a series of 5 'games' created for my semester one, year one studies at RMIT university. \u00a0Unfortunately, this game can only be played in the browser and with a computer. Please don't download it and modify the files, or post as your own. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87f4fb0bc6637ce5cb09d38dae198e42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
