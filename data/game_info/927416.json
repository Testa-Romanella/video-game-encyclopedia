Unfortunately, autism cannot be cured; it can only be assisted. Things like games and interacting with these people are particularly helpful in assisting them, and they need this. Therefore, I came up with this game in order to fill in the lost gaps of enjoyment some autistic people have with an addition to a storyline that will test their ability on decision making. These are simple games that most are familiar with, and the storyline, itself, will be easy to understand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T14:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15b/15ba1872e5694d6e4b1c111ecaaf2bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moddwyn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
