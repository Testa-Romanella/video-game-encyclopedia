Play as strong, hunky Snickers or slender Hershey's chocolate bars to finally settle which is the better treat! But beware of the trick... magical Lifesaver gummies lie in wait, eager to scoop up the ball and teleport it to  attack from an unexpected direction!</p>\n<p><strong>Specifications</strong></p>\n<p><em>Once active ball enters a wormhole, it cannot re-enter that same wormhole until it enters its sister wormhole on its own. This is to prevent infinite loops. Wormholes also reset once a point is scored.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T04:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83ac7c823465637e55800b76176bfde7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Setokaiva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
