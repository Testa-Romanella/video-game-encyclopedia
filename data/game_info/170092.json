But if you can beat it I salute you. :) Press A and D to swing like a pendulum in swing mode, or fire your rockets in rocket mode. Get the best time you can for those shiny gold medals. Wear good old skins (or new ones), and maybe rage quit, I don't know... Hope you have fun :D</p>\n<p>A game by:</p>\n<p>Nizkit (Discord @Nizkit#4699)<br/>Portza (Discord @Portza#4728)<br/>Emerald (Discord @Emerald_Mage_#9022)<br/>Tilde</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/zzjFzvF<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7da3088eff669ec95de2e8c3ba458517.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nizkit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
