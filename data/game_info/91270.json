With finals coming up, she decides to spend her reading week studying. When she accidentally falls asleep on a textbook, she discovers that she can enter the world of a book when she sleeps on it.</p><p>Will our protagonist forge friendships, or even romances, as she explores these books? Will she pass her exams, or will she drop out of college and become a cat lady? The choice is yours!</p><p>bookSLEEPer is a non-commercial otome game with stat-raising elements. There are a total of four routes (English, Microbiology, Photography, and Philosophy) to choose from, each created by a different writer and illustrated in a different style. With at least 9 unique endings and a variety of flavor texts depending on your choices, we hope that bookSLEEPer will be a game with high replay value.</p><p>The game is currently in version NaNo.1.1., which contains the following content (with some missing assets, more or less depending on the route.):</p><ul><li>100% of Microbiology Route</li><li>~90% of Photography Route</li><li>~70% of Philosophy Route</li><li>~20% of English Route</li></ul><p>We will be updating the files here as we finish the game. Thank you for your patience, and we hope you enjoy!
