You have to control twin stickman at the same time. Both stickman will react to your actions synchronously, but the exits and the paths are different. You have to make them get to the exit at the same time. <br/>At the beginning you have 10 lives and 2 armors, the lives will automatically recover every 5 minutes at first. As the more lives you lost, it will take longer to recover, so please think before you move. <br/>Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6caaf0a3453bc13827cddc5ef04b34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zhiqiang Huang"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Zhiqiang Huang"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
