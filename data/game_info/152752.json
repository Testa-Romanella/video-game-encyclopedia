So no need for any hating or trolling : if you don't like it or just don't get it, don't play ! </p>\n<p>And if you'd like to know more about what i do :</p>\n<p>http://stab-art.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.behance.net/stab\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/Stabeor/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/590/5904d61be04acfdf0a1c12f726c77e14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stabeor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
