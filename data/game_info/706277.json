The pivotal point in rediscovering our origins liberates us in our understanding of self and humanity. In the two rooms, the player can undergo these changes by being immersed in the imagined narrative of our future.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\uff61\uff65:*:\uff65\uff9f\u2605,\uff61\uff65:*:\uff65\uff9f\u2606\u3000\u3000 \uff61\uff65:*:\uff65\uff9f\u2605,\uff61\uff65:*:\uff65\uff9f\u2606</p>\n<p>In the future society, human life becomes subject to the command of technology and mechanization, and the initial elements of humanity gradually disappear. But as human beings, we cannot forget the origin of everything: the emergence of the cell, then the formation of life, then the enrichment of thinking that gives rise to our faith and hope. The concept of religion becomes obscure. Human beings gradually rediscover the original, the most primitive faith, the faith in life and thought, and the most genuine self.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The concept of life in the future is gradually blurred, and most mechanical objects replace life itself. The purpose of the idea in room 1 is to reawaken human beings and think about conceiving life, forming life, living in the world, and finally seeing the new world with two eyes.\r\n</p>\n<p>Because of the high development and mechanization of the future world, human beings want to evolve themselves to a higher form. But during this period, personal thoughts and emotions gradually disappear, leaving only a high level of technology. The precious thing about human beings is that they have deep and complex feelings and thoughts that machinery cannot experience and understand. The core here is to return to real life and the true self as human beings.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/8630849797b7cc83e1381eb75a9ee664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle.L."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
