Sick of your antics, the Witches set up a trap that you inevitably fall for. They throw you in a cell beneath the catacombs so they can live out the rest of their years without you stealing from them. You, a quick-witted cat, notice a stray key lying around your cell. How many things can you steal without the witches knowing? And with you making it out in one piece?\r\n</p>\r\nPresentation\r\n<p>PITCH DECK LINK\r\n</p>\n<p>WEEK 1 PRESENTATION SLIDES</p>\r\nAsset Credits\r\n<p>SPRITES:\r\n</p>\n<p>- Player:\u00a0https://9e0.itch.io/cute-legends-cat-heroes\r\n</p>\n<p>- Witches:\u00a0https://9e0.itch.io/witches-pack\r\n</p>\n<p>- Tiles:\u00a0https://rekkimaru.itch.io/dungeon-rpg-tileset\r\n</p>\n<p>- Icons:\u00a0https://cheekyinkling.itch.io/shikashis-fantasy-icons-pack\r\n</p>\n<p>- Freeze Zone:\u00a0https://galactic-castle.tumblr.com/post/98014823649</p>\n<p>AUDIO:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0GAME LOOP -&gt;\u00a0https://crossedkiller.itch.io/dungeon-music\r\n</p>\n<p>- START MENU -&gt;\u00a0https://void1gaming.itch.io/free-game-menu-music-pack\u00a0track 19\r\n</p>\n<p>- SFX:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-5...</p>\n<p>PROTOTYPE LINK</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T11:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b0117346b626b3de8380ecab2890169a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["apoorvak", "broomen", "junkim20", "Nick Dell'Aquilo", "Juliana Soranno"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
