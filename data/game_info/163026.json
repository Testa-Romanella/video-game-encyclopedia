I made it for my english class in college. This took me a long time to make, mostly because I was experimenting with stuff. Overall, I like how it turned out. You might enjoy this, at least more than my previous games, but don't expect something of genuine great quality. I'm still working on my first game like that.</p>\n<p>Ps.: I am having some weird problems in my end with extreme lag. It might be because of the platform, but if you experience anything, please let me know. There is a downloadable version too, which should work fine.</p>\n<p>To anyone interested:<br/>If you have anything you'd like to change about this, be it art or gameplay tweaks, I would love it if you contacted me. I can share the game files with you and will publish any changes made to this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72f0a64bbb8cebb209a0991484593687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GLanna98"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
