If you don't, you'll surely die.</p>\n<p>Because passwords in real life could be anything, it'll help going in to know some design principles for passwords in this game:</p>\n<ul><li>There are (usually) multiple answers.</li><li>Whitespace is ig\u00a0 nor\u00a0 \u00a0e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 d.</li><li>Passwords are case iNsENsITIVe.</li><li>Passwords are singular and there aren't any special characters.</li><li>There's a UI bar to the left. Use the whole window to your advantage!</li></ul>\n<p>This has only been tested on Windows and Android so far.</p>\n<p>If you are sensitive to flashing lights, be mindful that some words flash (similar to the provided screenshot).</p>\n<p>Made for Game Jam 2020, the theme of which is \"Out of Control.\"</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>The font effects (including the text shadow, but also the glitched text)\u00a0come from the coding of HiEv from his Sample Code for Twine 2 / SugarCube 2.
