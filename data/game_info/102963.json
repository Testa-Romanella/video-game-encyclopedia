One of these \"Cures\" had horrible side effects turning man into Z's. This cause Havoc and Chaos all over Miolhr.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Miolhrkind's last hope was left with these same scientist who continued to experiment with the Virus which changed so many of the Miolhrians into these Z's.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t (As you can tell not all of the People of Miolhr were Genuses..)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t After years of experimentation and luck a second cure was found but didn't work as they expected.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Side effect from the second \"Cure\" allowed some people of Miolhr to Control Elemental Skills.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t These People were called Users. Elemental type(s) are Fire, Water, Poison and Ice.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t (User are people with the ability to control Element Powers.)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t After years of training, the Top Users created DoJo's to train\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t and perfected their talents.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Years later Z's stated to build immunities and split off into 3 forms.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Poison. Blazing. Earth!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t This also allowed them to use these Skills.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t At the same time User trained developed 2 New Skills. Physical\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t and Tool.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t With these 6 Skills the World of Miolhr was balanced\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t for a short time.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t DoJo leaders stared to develop Dual User abilities.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t This was mostly through their training.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t This gave them the ability to control 2 Elements at once.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t For years DoJo leaders ruled the lands of Miolhr..until now...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Basics and Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t This is a game about survival.
