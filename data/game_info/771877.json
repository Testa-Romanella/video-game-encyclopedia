If this is the case, both players must find keys to open their respective doors. The level will not be cleared until both players have gotten to their respective doors.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:\u00a0</strong>If anyone truly likes this prototype's concept, please suggest ideas in the comments. If any bugs are found, please mention those as well, it'd really help with the future development of this game.
