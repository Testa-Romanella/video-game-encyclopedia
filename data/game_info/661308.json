The main attraction of the game is the portal by which you can teleport to the other end portal making fast movements. Every player has\u00a0 a orb which they can throw to mark the far end of the portal. The game is in the early stages of development and thus may contain bugs. This is just a demo version released after completing some of the basic mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls -</strong></p>\n<p>-&gt; WASD to move.</p>\n<p>-&gt; Space to jump and Left shift to sprint.</p>\n<p>-&gt; Q and E to peek left and right respectively.</p>\n<p>-&gt; Left mouse click for slow motion.</p>\n<p>-&gt; Sprint + W + (A [for left] OR D [for right]) + Space for Wall run.
