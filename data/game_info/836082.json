Right now it is in VERY early stages. I plan to add a diverse (non-linear) map for the campaign mode, over 30 bosses, close to 80 levels, and most likely update the graphics.</p>\n<p>This version of the game, Azalea King, has only been in the works for about a week and it's probably only taken me a total of 20 hours to whip up, however, it comes from a concept for a game that was originally spawned all the way back near the end of 2020 called Blocks &amp; Shapes. You may have seen it, and you'll notice the gameplay is extremely similar. However, that idea somehow morphed into whatever this is, so the Blocks &amp; Shapes saga has ended.
