The game was uploaded\u00a0for United Game Jam, with the theme of \"TWO\". I interpreted this quite simply: the gal's got two fists! And she swings'em around with right and left click.<br/></p>\n<p>I plan to keep working on it, mainly just to clean it up, y'know, add the animations and polish I didn't have time for, but maybe I'll make something a bit more interesting out of it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>If you participated in the jam, you can rate it on the jam page: https://itch.io/jam/united-game-jam-2020/rate/682563<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:21:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60add78e2ae38666a98c426872f68c4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["TaraMystic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
