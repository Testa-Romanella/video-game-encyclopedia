Young/Old/Average one, cause we, a team consisting of two brilliant artists, one HELL'a talented musician (get it? Hell, Halloween, Demons? Eh...) and a procrasting piece of a cardboard box that \"coded\" this game, present to you...</p>\r\nDiabolo Ex Machina\r\n<p>Summon demons pressing W (or Z if AZERTY-keyboard) and annoy the HELL (you see I did again, it was funny, trust me) out of them. Ask them to help or to outright solve the quiz parts for you (if you can't science). But be careful, cause teachers want none of those demons existing in the realm of their school. So unsummon demons by pressing S (or what key AZERTY-people have there).\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you get noticed - softlock. If you can't solve quiz right - softlock. If I forgot to code some integral part of the game - softlock.
