My first ever (mostly) solo jam! The hosts asked for entry's to stick to one or more from these themes (I of course did all three, because why not?); Dragons, Radiation, and Reflections, all while using only 2 colours! as an additional challenge the organizers asked we use game maker, so for the first time ever I did exactly that! The hosts also asked for source code if we wanted, but with it being my first time using GML i decided against it. The hosts also asked for entries to use Retro Palette Swapper, but i couldn't afford it. I wish I could though, it would have been so handy for a project like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 4 game modes, two for single player, Classic and Hardcore, and two for those of us not in isolation, Versus and Co-op. Rules are in the game, and lastly if you like this game please let me know and remember to vote for it in the jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a5a6d8062ffa131230df3307b57fcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poisonbiscuts"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
