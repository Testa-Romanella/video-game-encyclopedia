{"id": 492230, "slug": "challenge-speedball", "name": "Challenge Speedball", "name_original": "Challenge Speedball", "description": "Challlenge Speedball is a cooperative multiplayer game based on the paintball variation called Speedball.  <br/>\r\nIn this fast paced competition, teams of 1 to 5 players occupy a small playing field filled with inflatable \"bunkers\".  Each team tries to eliminate each others players by \"marking\" them with paint until they are all eliminated.  They can also win by reaching the other team's home base.  <br/>\r\nEach game match is timed typically depending on the number of players: 2 players play for 2 minutes, 10 players play for 10 minutes.   <br/>\r\nEach team will score 5 points through elimination of the other team's players and/or reaching the other team's home base.  <br/>\r\nEach team will score 1 point for lasting the duration of the game without being eliminated.<br/>\r\nThe actual game of Speedball is played on a small field where communication between team members is a vital part of winning the game.  Team members will call out their position as well as other teams status.  Each team will develop tactics and strategies with each member of the team having a designated position and role to play.  For this reason we highly recommend communicating during the game using Steam voice chat, Discord, or other means of voice communications.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLogo Photo Credit: Thanks to Stefan Krause, Germany", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T11:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aeccd19eb84b7cb3a98d55eaeef7a814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bucksoft91"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bucksoft91"], "esrb_rating": null}
