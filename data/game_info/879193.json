As you descend and reach following (randomly-generated) levels, they'll get longer, more dangerous, and more complex. Secret rooms will either kill you or reward you, so tread lightly. One room lets you skip to the next level, at the cost of not receiving the special skill that is a reward for each level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Such skills are the Double Jump, Dash, Thornmail (higher protection), Claw (greater damage), and a Doll that heals you when you find yourself shuffling off this mortal coil. Speaking of, try not to fall too hard, or your magic legs will break, and you'll magic die (which is code for real dying).</p>\n<p>Also there's a succubus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26d/26d8eac0830d928e46ad8f32b176cc26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fightiest-Fighter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
