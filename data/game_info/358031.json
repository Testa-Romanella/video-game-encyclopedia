Keep tapping the gender button until you get a name you like.<br/><br/>An improved name generation algorithm creates names (including surnames for playable races) that are more easily pronounceable.<br/><br/>If a generated name looks intimidating, you can tap it to hear your device say it out loud for you.<br/><br/>And, as a bonus, if you have a playable race selected, the app will spit out some random ideas you can use to describe the NPC to your players - things like age, hair styles, mannerisms, eye color, and clothing, just to name a few.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742bcfc484c715a390303ae1de0e2c69.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Crocker-Apps-515432132230399/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Crocker"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Thomas Crocker"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
