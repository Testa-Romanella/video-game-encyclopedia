A pong like/Air Hockey game with pucking magic and stuff. My first game that is currently in development.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>- Use the mouse to move.</p>\n<p>- Press the right mouse button to force push the pucks.</p>\n<p>This game was initially meant to be a mini game in an Action RPG game\u00a0I've planned to make. But the project was just\u00a0too big for me since I've just started learning Unity this year.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current version of the game can be played via browser for easy accessibility\u00a0but I intend to make it a PC game once its completed.</p>\n<p>This game is similar to pong but\u00a0with more players and balls (pucks in this case). The game will eventually have magic casting such as a fire force field that will make the pucks explode on contact, water based magic that slows the puck and prevent it from exploding.\u00a0Currently the I'm still developing the magic system. The current plan is to make it card based magic system with deck building.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After magic, I'm gonna focus on the multiplayer aspect which is gonna be online multiplayer (though I'm still trying to learn networking\u00a0(@_@)</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any feedback I can get regarding the current gameplay elements such as the controls, AI difficulty, the speed of the pucks,\u00a0amount of pucks in-field (current MAX = 8).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any suggestions on magic powers or improvements to the game\u00a0are appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. I still don't know what's the\u00a0genre of this game -_-\u00a0 maybe mini-game genre.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16c/16c208ac697885ece376302042bbad19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChibiRex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
