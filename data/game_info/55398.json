The game tells the comic fantasy story of Brad, a teenage boy from modern Earth who was magically abducted to the world of Enchantia by an evil witch-queen. Brad needs to escape and take on the forces of darkness to find a way back to his own dimension.</p>\n<p>Curse of Enchantia was Core Design's first attempt in the adventure genre as they set up to compete with LucasArts and Sierra On-Line. The game features several highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics and design choices for an adventure title from that era, including having many simple action game style sequences and being practically devoid of in-game text and conversations.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Curse was generally well received upon its release, especially by the Amiga magazines, where the game's graphics and animation received particular praise even as its illogical puzzles and unusual design choices were often criticized. A direct sequel was briefly planned but eventually turned into a spiritual successor game titled Universe and released in 1994.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec9dc0d556e6a099b0cecef79eb3bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Core Design"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Games", "Core Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
