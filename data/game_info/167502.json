{"id": 167502, "slug": "nono-rotogram", "name": "NoNo! RotoGram!", "name_original": "NoNo! RotoGram!", "description": "<p><strong>Description<br/></strong></p><p>NoNo! RotoGram! is a puzzle game about sliding. Think nonograms + Rubik's cube + 2D. It combines the rotation of a Rubik's cube and the scheme of a nonogram. The game can be played in one of two modes: normal and color. One only features black tiles, the other uses multiple colors for different tiles. The game has built-in levels for the player to play and also features an option for endless randomized challenges. For the particularly creative players there's also the built-in level editor with a palette editor. </p><p>Also available on Android! To install the apk file, you'll have to enable the 'install apps from foreign sources' option on your device.</p><p><strong>How to play?<br/></strong></p><p>1. Download the game.<br/>2. Follow the install instructions on the page above.<br/>3. I recommend you to start playing from built-in levels on normal mode.<br/>4. The numbers on top and side are what's called a delta pattern. Let's concentrate on a single row to better understand how the game works.<br/> - The pattern `1` means there's only a single tile of the given color, but the position is unknown.<br/>- The pattern `1 1` means there are two tiles in that row, but their positions and the gap between them is unknown.<br/> - The pattern `2` means there are two tiles and they're next to each other without a gap between them.<br/> - In color mode the pattern `1 1`, where each `1` has a different color, means thereare two tiles of the specified colors in that row and they may or may not have a gapbetween them.<br/>5. Complete the delta pattern both vertically and horizontally to complete a level. Tiles are moved by sliding rows or columns vertically and horizontally. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb69ffdae1b71f63346ae9e001111a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["pi_pi3"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
