Or at least it's not mine anymore.\"\u00a0</em></strong>You muttered this to yourself literally seconds later after you woke up with a limp leg, unsure what to do with little knowledge to what mediocrity is up ahead.<br/>You know as a matter of fact that you may have to figure things out on your own, and you really want to know whenever you should try and get out or stay.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\"Not My House\"</strong> is an experimental horror fangame based on Dan Fornace's \"Rivals of Aether\" made as a short \"Halloween special\" starring an unidentified person with a limp leg covered behind several sprites and aswell as some unusual guests.<br/></p>\n<p>Or should I say the new house owners in this case?</p>\n<p>I don't know. It's a small game that just exists - it was done to fulfil my desire to create a first actual fangame to a game I am sure most people have probably never heard of (well...not until the Workshop feature went into the Steam Beta Branch, apparently). I don't expect it to do well (from both critical and popularity points of view), but I am just more than happy to get <em>at least</em> something out there.</p>\n<p><strong>To quickly summarize the origins behind this game,</strong> I made it as an unofficial (although intentionally mediocre) alternative for some people, who (I AM NOT SURE IF THEY WERE JOKING OR NOT, BUUUUUT-) weren't satisfied with an April Fools game Dan Fornace released on Steam just because of the \"Psychological Horror\" tag used for humorous reasons (mostly \"bleh-bleh-bleh-ur-a-furry-ahahaha-laugh\" ones), assumingly misleading them that the game would take a clich\u00e9 twist a-la \"Doki Doki Literature Club\" style.</p>\n<p>So yeah, here you go. Are you folks happy? Now please leave Dan alone and let him port Rivals to Switch already, you cucks.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: I actually planned to do it for a whole year now! Can you believe this?</p>\n<p>I actually cannot confirm on whenever I will be making a bigger and better horror themed Rivals of Aether fangame project (because, well, I am kind of already working on a more original and intentionally (but not like \"broken code\" intentionally) wonkier project that already is taking enough time), but if there's a positive demand for it, I'll try to find time to work on another game.</p>\n<p>But for now, I hope you enjoy this tiny .exe wannabe! :D</p>\n<p>---------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>Created and developed by </em><strong><em>Nickolai Filipanov</em></strong><em> in </em><strong><em>Clickteam Fusion 2.5<br/></em></strong><em>Based on a game by </em><strong><em>Dan Fornace &amp; the \"Rivals Team\".</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Quick Disclosure</strong>: This is a game that was complete in barely a few weeks, and it's not a full representation of my programming ability - it's made for non-profit fun [therefore the ads are disabled on this page (like Google would allow ads on mature-only areas of the web anyway lol)], entertainment purposes, and all that fun happy yum-yum jazz.
