This is also my first ever game jam!</p>\n<p>This game is about You and a dog named Bruno (I don't know why but I put a dog into the game). They were on the most important mission they ever had until something went wrong. You are now trying to fix your rocket to get back to earth.</p>\n<p>The story is a bit unfinished and confusing and the game play might be boring, but this is my first ever game jam so give me a break. This has been really good practice for me and very good experience.\u00a0I wanted to implement more into the game but it wasn't important and didn't have enough time, what I focused on was to at least submit a playable game.</p>\n<p>It was fun participating in this game jam and hope to join the next one! I want to practice a lot to turn this game making thing a career and this was a lot of help!</p>\r\n-Controls-\r\n<p>WASD - Move\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0E - interact\u00a0 \u00a0|\u00a0 \u00a0Esc - Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8be4cc571dcf6c156d8cb1db89605897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weirdly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
