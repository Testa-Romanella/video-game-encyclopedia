Only misery awaits those that dare attempt to play the game. It is hardly even a game!</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you like finicky controls (I will call it a feature, since the theme for the GMTK 2020 Jam is \"Out of control\") you will not be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Go to the green lit room and win. That's it. The more you spin the harder it gets, so don't. Rotation is optional after all.</p>\n\n<p>Programmer rant:<br/>Magnets, how do they work? Surprisingly simple. Quaternions on the other Hand are the spawn of Satan. I spent one whole day to figure them out and make them do whatever I wanted. I have no idea, why everything is \"working\" and I will for certainly refrain from examining the code for a while. <br/>Originally the game was supposed to have portals (with cake), other non euclidean shenanigans and dynamic gravity.<br/>I had an alternative control scheme that was more straight forward, read easy to use, but I chose to swap it for the thing you see before you. The reason for this is the lack of  gameplay. Easy controls -&gt; there is no game.<br/>Moral of the story:<br/>Focus on one feature and make something you do regularly or have done before.</p><p>Here are some numbers for you, don't know what they are good for:<br/>F3F1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f2/6f2ba72d84eb59f7f73251a1f8ff8c2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Voidsay"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
