After you're plane has crashed in the middle of the Ocean, your only means of survival is a fishing rod. From a nearby rock, you must sit and fish to pass the time and to keep yourself alive. Surprisingly, fighting for your life can actually be pretty chill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has 2 game modes to choose from:</p>\n<p><strong>Survival:\u00a0</strong><br/>With a timer counting down to your demise, you must catch fish to gain more time. Each fish adds a varying amount of time, small fish offer 5 seconds, medium sized fish offer 10 and large fish awarding a whopping 20 additional seconds of sweet sweet life.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Peaceful:\u00a0</strong><br/>It's just fishing, but without the shoe horned timer mechanics that I added to match the theme some what. Just relax and catch some fish.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>Left click to cast your line, left click to reel it back in.\u00a0<br/>When a fish is on the hook, smash left click repeatedly to reel it in. Larger fish require more clicks and will stay on the line for less time. Pull up with the mouse to reduce the number of clicks needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can press 'R' to restart at any time and 'ESC' to exit to the main menu.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8e/b8ecdd977a47dc3c2467ed25584837b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Whitehead"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
