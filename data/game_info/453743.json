However, some of them actually hide a Life Shread! Let's collect them!</p>\n<p>Place torches to reveal the Life Shreads and to stay protected: around torches, your enemies take damage.</p>\n<p>Keep yourself away from the winter forest! The more rampant the snowy trees around you, the more Bloobs are going to attack you.</p>\n<p>The further away you roam from the center, the more dangerous enemies you'll encounter. Plan accordingly!</p>\n<p>Visit shops to purchase incredibly useful items from the money you can find on enemies you kill. Shops have different stocks, so keep exploring them!</p>\n<p>The map is randomly generated, so no playthroughs are gonna be the same.</p>\n<p>And the rest... you'll figure out on your own!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T06:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0a/e0a6ad2041bbf709d3247fe3b9fb671d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Krist\u00f3f Morva"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
