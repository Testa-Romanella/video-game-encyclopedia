{"id": 953773, "slug": "mijukuna-hearts-alpha", "name": "Mijukuna Hearts (Alpha)", "name_original": "Mijukuna Hearts (Alpha)", "description": "<p>A Visual Novel about an exchange student meeting some odd people. 4 endings in total. Only one of them is the True Ending. about 15min to 20min of gameplay. Please do not donate. I have not decided yet if to commit and complete the really serious long VN since I only have the story drafted. I just want all the feedback I can get.\u00a0I apologize for the badly cropped character art in advance,  more on that down below.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind\u00a0This visual novel was made by one dude.\u00a0This visual novel is just a concept only. This story\u00a0doesn't have a real direction or real future. If I decide to continue with this project I would re-do all the character assets and change the story.\u00a0I do have a good serious story but it would take months to shape it into a Visual Novel.\u00a0Only the characters and the world\u00a0are real. Think of it as a fever dream or just a silly story.</p>\n<p>Since I have some years as a musician and just 3 months of experience programming,\u00a0I made all the music, script, and programming. I only used Ai for the art (Since I have zero to no talent with art). I apologize in advance for the badly cropped character art the characters were made in early January just before the many many ai tools were released. (*If I decide to continue with this project I would re-do all the character assets)</p>\n<p>Dear Testers,</p>\n<p>As a super novice developer, I understand the concern that some of you may have with regard to AI-generated content in video games. I understand that ai represents a huge issue in\u00a0this genre, so I wanted to clarify that this game was never intended to be taken seriously. It was meant to be a light-hearted and silly experience, one that would hopefully provide entertainment (hopefully)\u00a0during those 15 minutes of gameplay.\r\n</p>\n<p>That being said, I understand that different people have different sensitivities and points of view.\u00a0 I will listen\u00a0to all feedback and take it into consideration for future projects. In the meantime, I hope that those of you who do decide to play my game can appreciate it for what it is: a silly, lighthearted 5min adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Don't take it seriously. And do not donate of course. I just want all the feedback I can get to see if I have what it takes to make a serious\u00a0Visual Novel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T17:25:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7a8325daf727dd1c7fe81d9989b664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seven"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
