I definitely won't say that I didn't have enough time to make it a game - I just tried to jump over my head, and spent about ten hours kicking the dead horse, a.k.a. making those <strong>precious\u00a0</strong>graphics and sounds. That's definitely not the game as I imagined it, with a ton of unfinished features, but I still like it. I was really late to make any real tutorials or make it visually understandable, so I'll just say it here - the game is about inflation. Anytime you can print money by clicking on the money icon - counter-intuitive, huh? You're the president, after all. Unity messed with a lot of stuff I was trying to make - for example, animations on UI. After few crashes I just sent a report and went my way with static pictures. <br/><br/>So, basics:</p>\n<p><strong>PRESS SPACE TO SKIP A MONTH<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>PRESS MONEY ICON TO PRINT CASH<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>PRESS ON THE REGIONS TO SEE THE DETAILS<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>BALANCE BETWEEN SATISFYING THE ARMY, THE PEOPLE AND THE INDUSTRY.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>STAY A PRESIDENT FOR FOUR YEARS</strong><br/></p><p>Do not try to get anything from the countries around you or the capital of your country - those are the remains of features I wasn't able to finish in time. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Well, till next time, Mister President?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8babd7c386c1fc284e93dbbff0199cf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["williander"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
