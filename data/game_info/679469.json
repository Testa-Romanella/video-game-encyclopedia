Feedback is really important so leave your comment below. Thank you and hope you have a great time playing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*You can jump by clicking any button.</p>\n<p>**You can doublejump but be careful... Doublejump may save you last minute but it may kill you too. So use it wisely. Remember..
