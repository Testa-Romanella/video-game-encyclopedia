Once powered the new device should turn green to indicate success.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can only create a connection between a powered device and an non-powered device, however each powered device can power multiple new devices. If a device is too far away the connection indicator will turn red meaning you may need to find another route to your desired device.</p>\n<p>You have a limited number of active connections per level and you will need to disconnect devices by clicking on the lighting icon on a connection to disable it and any other unpowered connections coming from it.</p>\n<p>By connecting a power-up node, indicated by a large letter<strong> P(Fire Power)</strong>, <strong>S(Fire Speed)</strong> or <strong>R(Firing Range)</strong>, the following tower/s will gain the relevant increase to their stats as long as they are connected to the power-up.</p>\n<p>Destroy all enemies in a level to continue, before they reach the endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can connect multiple devices/turrets from a powered node- use this to double up on power-ups.</li><li>If you disconnect a device which is powering additional devices, all connections on the chain will be retrieved - use this to get your connections back quicker.</li><li>Sometimes it's better to have another turret rather than using a connection to grab a power-up.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Game Design and Art -- Troy Vaughn</p>\n<p>Background Music -- Blacksmith by GodMode\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2afa3e744f4376c93447ccdfae79468c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LordBundee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
