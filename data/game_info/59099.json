{"id": 59099, "slug": "torn", "name": "Torn", "name_original": "Torn", "description": "Torn is a dark science-fiction mystery built for VR.<br/><br/>Deep in a forgotten forest, video blogger Katherine Patterson discovers an abandoned mansion, littered with strange machines and disturbing experiments. This is the home of the famed Dr. Lawrence Talbot, who went missing more than 64 years ago. This could be the story of Patterson\u2019s career, worth millions\u2026 But when she meets Dr. Talbot in person -- still alive, trapped in another dimension, and missing his body --  Patterson realizes she was wrong. This is the story of a lifetime.  <br/><br/>Torn opens as a narrative puzzle game as you help Talbot reactivate the mysterious machines that bring his mansion to life. Then it evolves into a dark, character-driven story as you slowly uncover the truth about Talbot, and the new dimension he calls \u201cThe Parallel.\u201d Remember everything you see, for in Talbot\u2019s world, truth is nothing more than the invention of the mind.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Mansion</strong> - Teeming with the puzzles and machinations of a mad, disembodied physicist, Talbot\u2019s mansion is a sandbox VR tourist destination built for fans of classic science fiction like The Twilight Zone and Black Mirror.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Spectacular Acts of Vandalism</strong> - Use Dr. Talbot\u2019s gravity tool to fling pianos with the flick of a wrist. Build giant towers of objects and bring them crashing down in grand fashion. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Cinematic VR</strong> - Written by Neill Glancy (Stranglehold) and Susan O\u2019Connor (Tomb Raider, BioShock). Original orchestral score composed by Garry Schyman (BioShock, Middle Earth: Shadow of War).<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a3511b5c3cd8c4b2a80d94fe9bd4238a.jpg", "website": "https://www.tornvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 57, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 632, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Aspyr Media", "Massively multiplayer text based RPG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Aspyr"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
