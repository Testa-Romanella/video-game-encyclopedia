Your goal is to conquer hostile lands using the power of your dice. To attack, roll all dices from your land against the all dices from the enemy land. The one with the higher score wins the engagement and can move forward. Each round you get new dices randomly distributed based on the amount of connected lands. This adds a strategical component to the game, so you have to build a contiguous kingdom.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Click: Select Land (First select your attacker land, then select enemy land to attack)</li><li>Mouse Down + Drag: Move around</li><li>CTRL + Mouse Down: Rotate &amp; Zoom</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T10:10:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59e/59eb4b9cee877d6072a49b77dc526b6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["RastaEule"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
