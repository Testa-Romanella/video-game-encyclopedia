It took a lot longer than I\u00a0care to admit and it isn't perfect, but I am proud of it! I used to love Motherload when I was growing up and It is 100% the inspiration for this game. It is certainly more cut down, and the graphics need improved as well as maybe new features added, but I\u00a0wanted to get it out there and see what people had to say!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e59/e595c303616d0feed3ed3db4c0228eaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kcin41@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
