Each of these ancient items casts upon you a curse, and a cumbersome screen effect with it. Retro graphics, space-bending rainbows! How much post-processing\u00a0can you take before you're swallowed by the bottomless void beneath your feet?</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your job is to steal the four relics scattered around a map, along with any coins you can pick up along the way. It won't be easy, and each run is graded on how well you perform, so use bunny hopping and strafing to your advantage to gain speed and beat the timer. Each and every relic gives you a special perk such as extra speed or a mid-air dash, but they all come with their own screen effect that make it harder to see. Holding one relic alone might not be much of a hinderance, but as they start to add up, the smooth methodical platforming gameplay turns into an off-the-rails, mad-dash, collect-em-up!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Space - Jump (can be held)</li><li>Shift - Mid-air dash (when unlocked)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14e3bf4a8247105196e3c76b8a6d9b3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apollogeist"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
