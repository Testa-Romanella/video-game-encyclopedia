Word has been spreading around the northern land of Balerook Hold, talk of\u00a0an evil warlock up to no good who answers to the\u00a0name \"Xarmoc\". Rumor has it, villagers from the town of Balen have entered a mysterious spire nearby, never to return. YOU must explore this spire, vanquish the evil within, and return in one piece.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created back in 2018 for my DTS class in Year 11 at Wellington College, Xarmoc Spire is the first game I ever made. I spent about a month working on it, finishing on 04/09/18. It was made using Game Maker Studio 2.</p>\n<p>The \"Classic\" title is there because I would like to return to Xarmoc Spire, updating the game in a UE4 with a fresh coat of paint, some new features, and so on. This is the original 2018 version with no changes made from the submitted project.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Benjamin Pilbrow</strong> - EVERYTHING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T08:50:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/5218a38b843516b5386a3f2e88f9f9c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lemoss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
