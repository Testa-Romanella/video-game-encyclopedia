It is focused on the story of a stickman that \"died\" in a game of hangman, and that could have been the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, something strange happened... Somehow the drawings in the hangman paper\u00a0came to life, and this created a series of events that lead to the stickman breaking into 3 separate body parts (Legs, Torso &amp; Arms, and head) with a lot of force, and this impulse made that these body parts went out the paper, and land up in other drawings. Since you are stickman, you can control every part of your body individually, and now, you have a clear objective; gather your body parts and become a complete stickman again, so that you can be able to save other stickmans to suffer the same faith as you did.</p>\n<p>Their faiths are now in your hands...</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\u200e**<em><strong>RECOMMENDED TO PLAY IN FULLSCREEN (BLUE BUTTON).</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>***<em>Side note:\u00a0</em><em>I got to say that I am actually very proud of what I achieve by myself! I never really made a game from scratch with my own ideas, I mostly been in tutorial hell, which is not bad, but still. Anyway, the fact of crafting a game like this was quite the experience, and I loved it! I know that the game could use a lot of improvements, but despite that, I loved this final result!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>****<em>Btw, I know many of you are thinking it;\u00a0so yes, I took some ( a lot /:\u00a0) of inspiration from Uncharted.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>7. ...\u00a0<em>ENJOY!! iT'S MY FIRST SOLO GAME, SO i HOPE YOU LIKE IT (:\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>GitHub Repository</strong>:\u00a0https://github.com/Pecas-Dev/Unplumbed-A-Stickman-s-End</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T11:07:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/332/332d4b78ea2a0b859a96c08179645c0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["PecasDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
