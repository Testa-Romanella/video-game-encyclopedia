The castle of demons told by many as a legend appeared before him, and all the colours in the land disappeared. He returned home and saw his son was missing and thus he grabbed his trusty boomerang and shield to venture out to the castle where it was told evil roamed the darkness for all eternity.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>This game is a demo of a game that will be developed on and released next year (Most likely.) It is mostly inspired by the classic Castlevania games and other platformers of that era, with some light RPG elements. This demo includes the intro and level 1. There will be 7 levels in the actual game.</p>\n<p>If you got any suggestions and/or criticisms I will gladly accept them, as it can make the game better in many ways! :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Programming - SeventyFour Productions</p>\n<p>Spritework - SeventyFour Productions / Bro.
