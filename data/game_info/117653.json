Help Spiri, the forest spirit to fulfill his destiny and reach the tree of life. You help each other to go deeper and deeper into the forest. This does not only require skill but also teamwork, ingenuity and quick reflexes.</p>\n<p>Spirit Forest contains many elements of a classic platformer. What makes the game unique is the cooperative aspect of it. Two players each control a character at the same time. Neither of them can reach the end of the level without the help of the other. The protagonist can active switches to remove barriers \u00a0that prevent the sidekick from moving ahead. </p>\n<p>Combining several simple obstacles and mechanics lets us create fun and diverse problems that can be solved in multiple ways. This keeps the game fresh and invites players to replay it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8de3eb98a19492ec8e0032d724a46294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S4G School for Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
