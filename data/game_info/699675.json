Please comment with any bugs and\u00a0I'll do my best to fix them asap\u00a0*</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Welcome to Idle Gradient</strong></p>\n<p>This is an incremental/idle game where the goal is to create color combinations of red, green, and blue components in the RGB model format: (#red, #green, #blue).</p>\n<p>Visit the\u00a0<strong>IDLE GRADIENT</strong> tab for the main play area. Build a gradient from one color to another by creating red, green, and blue components of the colors. Purchase upgrades by spending Pixel Points which are gained for every completed color block. Pixel Points reset when a gradient is completed and the upgrades must be purchased again.</p>\n<p>Visit the\u00a0<strong>PRESTIGE STORE</strong> tab to buy permanent upgrades. Every time you complete a full gradient, you will be awarded with 1 Prestige Point. You can spend those points here to unlock automation, recycle (creating multiple blocks every time 1 is completed), custom start and end colors, and permanent increases to your starting Pixel Points. Prestige Points are kept through multiple rounds.</p>\n<p>Visit the\u00a0<strong>PROGRESS GOALS</strong> tab to complete pre-set goals. If you complete all the goals in a set, another set of goals will unlock and the gradient size will increase! Current there are 6 sets of goals and completing more colors does not progress the game.</p>\n<p>Visit the\u00a0<strong>SETTINGS</strong> tab to manually save your game (game automatically saves when a gradient is completed), or to reset and delete your current saved game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:54:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e08/e08f3cd29d2af4f28456290bc1eac206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wayne Huras"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
