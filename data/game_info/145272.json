Collecting energetic photons, with the right energies, will allow you to get get enough energy to escape the atom entirely.</p><p>Enjoy jumping from atom to atom, maybe you will even remember some of the names :)</p><p>There is no end to the game, just an endless line of atoms. Score are only for your own enjoyment, and has no consequences to the player.</p><p>Controls: Mouse only</p><p>Game rules:</p><p>The energy of the photons needed to escape is indicated by the color of the outermost orbit color. In the bottom you have the same information, plus a valid range of energies (colors) that you can safely hit. If you collect a photon with to much energy, you will be overexcited for a couple of seconds, if you hit a photon with to little energy you will just be pushed around a bit.</p><p>When absorbing a photon, locate yourself so the momentum will carry you out of the atom to escape.<br/></p><p>Atoms with very low and very high masses, are very hard to escape from.<br/> Photons needed to escape the low  Atoms are limited in energy and most have way to much energy.<br/>For atoms with high masses only few photons have enough energy to allow you to escape.</p><p>Just relax and wait for the right one to come by and let you journey out into the world. ;)</p><p>Everything was created within the 48 hours of the Ludum Dare 38 - Theme: A Small World<br/></p><p>Thanks for playing. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13eb1a1e64a078f6697e4abd3f4cba65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["INCD021"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
