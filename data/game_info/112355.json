Each of these spires is being targeted by waves of exploding enemies which can be redirected using the monk's powers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Cybermonk is focused on dual purpose design. Each of the enemies can be used as a projectile against the other enemies to create large chain explosions. However, the monk has limited powers and must recharge by entering the proximity of a live spire. \u00a0His power also affects his own movement; if the player charges the power for a long time it will push the monk in the opposite direction once released. If at least one spire is alive after defending against multiple enemy waves, the monk is successful!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created by Dan, Ed, Mikhail, Matthew, and Michael as a submission to the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam of 2017.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use of a gamepad (Xbox controller, PS controller, etc.) is strongly recommended. The left thumb-stick (or keys WASD) moves the monk and the right thumb-stick (or keys IJKL) controls his powers.
