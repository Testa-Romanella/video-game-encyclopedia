Specifically, how those stereotypes related to an assumption of binary genders are limiting, exclusive and segregating.</p>\n<p>The games industry has for a long time been a serious offender of gender stereotypes and misrepresentation. We only have to look back at the quintessential game \u201cMario\u201d to see contrast between hero of action as a male and damseling for the female. Even though this game was developed thirty years ago, it's binary nature of gender representation is still prevalent today. \u00a0</p>\n<p>We believe that now more than ever there is a cultural and societal importance associated to games, to establish a set of personal freedoms and connections of a diverse audience to a role-playing avatar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebff54550bbe1b4c96936ea14816d92a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["walkies3"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
