The vehicles of the type R2.2 were, after 15 years of usage, modernized from the ground up and are in operation since 2011, known as series R2.2b. Interior and exterior are in the modernised design, consisting of blue and white-aluminum. New support bars, extended passenger information, and sliding doors are marks of the redesign. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Reconstructed with a focus on detail and quality, Munich's R2.2b is driven through the virtual city. The vehicle is styled in the modern redesign of the MVG and provided with diverse functionality and it's unqiue behavior of movement. Since this model is used in many cities in Germany, the tram is fully repaintable to be able to style it in any design you want to. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The R2.2b is known for its unique and sometimes unintuitive driving dynamics. Because of the way the tram is built, the individual tram-bodies influence each other. At the end of a curve, this behavior leads the train to sway into the other direction. Even some curbs in the city have been cut out to accommodate this!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As can be expected from TramSim Vienna, the tram in Munich is realised with realistic, and true-to-detail functionality. Discover the R2.2b with it\u2019s authentic driving dynamics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Wether Open World or scheduled service with timetable, the full TramSim experience is waiting for you in Munich!

It is a special route in the city, as it starts in a specially built station-building at the M\u00fcnchner Freiheit and operates on an independent track body and its own bridge structure.<br/><br/>Time of travel for those 7 stops is about 8 minutes and therefore suits itself for short playing sessions, as a complete tour can be finished in 25 minutes. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The route 27 runs in the heart of Munich, starting from the Sendlinger Tor over Karlsplatz, Karolinenplatz, Kurf\u00fcrstenplatz, and Hohenzollernplatz, to the Petuelring. This route is not just operating by day, it is also used by night.<br/><br/>Time of travel for those 15 stops along the route is about 20 minutes. Going past so many known attractions, like the Pinakotheken or the Alte B\u00f6rse, time will just fly! <br/><br/><br/><br/>The route 28 starts from the Sendlinger Tor as well and runs over Karlsplatz and Karolinenplatz to the Kurf\u00fcrstenplatz. There it splits from the shared route with route 27 and travels to the Scheidplatz.<br/><br/>Time of travel for the 12 stops along the route is about 16 minutes. Try it yourself!
