The winner being the one mastering the most powerful spells. But the Internet was created and the rise of spell tutorials changed everything. How does one determine who is the best wizard when everyone knows the best spells? A few wizards had an idea: create a new type of tournament that doesn\u2019t rely on who knows the best spell, but who masters the most spells, and above all, who adapts best to any combat situation. A tournament where each wizard gets assigned a single spell that they swap when attacking each other. The Spell Swap tournament was born! Join in the fight in this frantic spell-stealing fest and try to become the best Spell Swapper!<br/><br/><strong>Learn to master each spell, and choose wisely who you attack in order to become the best Spell Swapper!</strong><br/><br/><h3>Don't forget to wishlist !</h3><br/><h3>We now have a Discord server!</h3><br/>Come join us on Discord in order to chat with the devs, stay updated on the game and chat about Spell Swap.<br/>https://discord.gg/NAvSFRRPYJ<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T03:13:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/850bbbc0de5a15be2e80274f05156f56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teagher Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Abiding Bridge"], "esrb_rating": null}
