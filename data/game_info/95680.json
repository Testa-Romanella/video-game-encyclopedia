Unfortunately, since you were previously eaten by the World Serpent, J\u00f6rmungandr, \u00a0you're stuck inside!</p>\n<p>You must jump and climb up in a vain attempt to climb out of the belly of the beast as chunks of meat rain down from above. Keep an eye above to avoid getting crushed, and keep an eye below to avoid slipping into the rising stomach acid!</p>\n<p><strong>Origin:<br/></strong>Super Skelly Belly is a game that originally came out of the 24hr Forsberg Game Jam.<br/>The theme was Eternity. The game has now been in development well past it's initial start.
