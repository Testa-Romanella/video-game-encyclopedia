Yes, we are a couple.\u00a0Milky is a full-time burnt out web programmer and Shineki is a student.</p>\r\nWhat we did ourselves\r\n<p>All the graphics are done by us, obviously; nothing third party there. Mostly Shineki here.</p>\n<p>Programming was pretty tough as we don\u2019t use those gigantic frameworks and engines to do our games; a big thanks to the Go community for providing a feasible alternative. Programming was mostly on Milky.</p>\n<p>Sound effects (again, not the music) are also all done by Milky.</p>\n<p>This is our second try at a gamejam, so we don't have a proper workflow or techniques -- just trying to make\u00a0<em>something</em>.\u00a0<strong>It's also our first finished game!</strong></p>\r\nWhat tools we used\r\n<ul><li>Ebiten, the game framework\u00a0(Pixel\u00a0would be better but it didn't have web export)</li><li>Go programming language (Golang)</li><li>Aseprite</li><li>The OP-1\u00a0and Audacity\u00a0for audio\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nBoring dev details for nerds\r\n<p>The source code is available\u00a0at gitlab, among other gamejams that we\u2019ve attended and Milky's hobby stuff and various linux dotfiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any OS that has some OpenGL should be able to run our game; Go itself is cross-platform.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you've ever struggled with Pygame's performance, don't wanna bother learning Rust or C++ or you don't want to use big engines, try Go for yourself. We can wholeheartedly recommend it.</p>\r\nWe know, ok?\u00a0\r\n<p>a.k.a. Known issues</p>\n<p>It's our first actual release and our first time in the library. Most technical issues are just with the web build but we really wanted to have it. Who's got the time to download it, amirite</p><p><strong>That being said, we would very much like to continue development until we're satisfied with it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound and music</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The sounds and the song sometimes don't load fast enough and plays only after restart. Don't know what causes it, first time in the library.\u00a0</li><li>When the game lags, the sounds\u00a0<strong>break and jitter</strong>. The library didn't let me change the buffer size so that's just how it is. On a proper non-web build it isn't an issue though.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Space is unresponsive</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Because we're using one key for everything, you shouldn't be able to click off and (re)start by accident... But it's weird on the web build and sometimes it just doesn't respond. Just press it a bunch\u00a0if it doesn't want to restart.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Balancing</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>We didn't really playtest it enough; it's kinda hard and kinda easy at the same time... yea...</li><li>The class could\u00a0be longer so you can\u00a0enjoy the music... But seriously, check\u00a0out Bossfight instead.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>And yes, we should have randomized the words, they are the same every time. Whoops.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b650ac7ca18b16f72528bb15939f9301.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GLASSPAIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
