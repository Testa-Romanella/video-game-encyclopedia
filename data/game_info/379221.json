{"id": 379221, "slug": "roses-are-red", "name": "Roses Are Red", "name_original": "Roses Are Red", "description": "<p>Work together with a partner to solve a gauntlet of puzzles in this short and sweet game. In each room, neither of you will have access to the full picture; instead, one player will have the puzzle, and the other will have the solution. The challenge comes from how well the two of you can communicate without being able to see each other's screens. Trust and listen to each other, and you'll be fine...</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before starting the game, please read SettingUp.pdf, included with the download.\u00a0This is needed to have our intended experience with the game.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Roses Are Red</em> is an award-winning game! It took second place in the Undergraduate Capstone category at Kennesaw State University's spring 2019 computing showcase.<br/>See all the winners here:\u00a0https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/computing-showcase/cday-winners-spr19.php<br/>And the full program here:\u00a0https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/computing-showcase/cday-programs/spring19program.php</p>\n\r\nI recommend only reading further once you have played the game.\r\n\n\n<p><em>Roses Are Red</em> serves a greater purpose than being a simple cooperative puzzle game. It is also a game about color-blindness. When playing the game, we encourage players to put their screens back-to-back, so that each can only see their own side. This is to prevent players from learning that they are afflicted with deuteranopia and tritanopia, respectively. In truth, the solution to every puzzle in\u00a0<em>Roses Are Red</em> is to match colors, but this is impossible because the players do not perceive color in the same way. Our hope is that, through the communication struggles players will face, they can come to a better understanding of the difficulties of being\u00a0color-blind.</p>\n\r\nOur Team\r\n<p><strong>Brian Patterson</strong> -- Lead Game Designer, Puzzle Programmer<br/><strong>Adam Woods</strong> -- Asset Manager, Hint UI, Programmer (\u00a0https://adamwoods.pb.online/ )<br/><strong>Chris Budden</strong> -- Audio and Post-Processing Manager, Programmer\u00a0(\u00a0https://cbudden.itch.io/\u00a0)<br/><strong>Dillon Smith</strong> -- Level Designer\u00a0(\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-smith25\u00a0)<br/><strong>Zared Redding</strong> -- Player Interaction and UI, AI Programming and\u00a0Design (\u00a0https://www.zared.co/\u00a0)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T05:29:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba0e8c7c0c7bc087492f7260a76841f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Patterson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
