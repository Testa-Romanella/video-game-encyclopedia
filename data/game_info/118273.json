We now see we made some bad choices and underestimated the complexity in all of it, but working on this project was a great learning opportunity for all of us.</p><p>We intend to finish it later, but for the purposes of the jam, it is a still an ongoing project.</p><p>The idea here is to display a person suffering from body disphoria, as a turn based battle against the one self while looking in the mirror.</p><p>The person suffering from disphoria is shown as a strong female character as this person would like to be. In reality though, it's current gender identity expression is seen as a small and sad boy, who is trying to go out to a birthday party.</p><p>It has inspirations from games like Child of Light and Walking Dead point and click series.</p><p>We really loved this experience and you will see more of our games in near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a0481ea57bbefa636ffcbf0d7304715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["velvetlobster"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
