Travel through randomly generated dungeons, find treasure and fight all kinds of weird monsters. The combat is inspired by games such as Guilty Gear or Under Night In-Birth. Despite this, all moves are performed by pressing buttons and/or holding directions, making it easy for beginners to step into the game and start shooting fireballs. You can also equip your fighters with badges and helper-characters to give you an edge over your enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is the game's third demo and contains two dungeons, four regular playable characters and one customizable fighter. Beatdown Dungeon is still in development and feedback is always welcome! Don't hesitate to raise your voice if you didn't enjoy something, be it certain moves, or a character's hair color. If you run into any glitches, please report them.</p>\n<p>Additions since the last demo:</p>\n<ul><li>New playable character \"Shirley\"</li><li>Second dungeon is now included</li><li>Basic training mode</li><li>Ability to choose between three different color pallettes for each character</li><li>More items and map events</li><li>Support for PS4 controllers (in addition to XBOX 360 pads)</li><li>Button config for controllers</li><li>a whole bunch of minor tweaks and fixes</li></ul>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you want to learn more about the game's combat, download the instructions.txt file. Oh, and the game is currently missing resolution options. I'm working on that.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game has been tested on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.</p>\n<p>XBOX 360 Controllers and PS4 Controllers (recommended) alongside keyboard controls are currently supported.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBeatdown Dungeon is a creation of Phil, aka WurstbrotPhil.
