Whenever we are angry or frustrated or sad, we think about punching a wall or a pillow. But what if I say I made a game in which there is an Emoji waiting to get your punch. You would be happy right? The Emoji will be too. More I have put some funny sound effects and interesting relaxing music to help you calm down. This game is completely Ad-Free. The game is quite funny. You must download it once. you will not regret that. And if you like my work, you can donate a little amount of money. After all, this is ad-free. Please help me to create some more cool stuff. thank you......", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/5184e089bfc18b7e1e660eaaada6978b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["shahnawaz28"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
