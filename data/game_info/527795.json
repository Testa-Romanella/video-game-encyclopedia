The concept of the game was\u00a0\u00a0inspired by the\u00a0</p>\n<p>video made\u00a0by Steve Cutts about <strong>\"Happiness\"</strong> and the art was inspired by the\u00a0</p>\n<p>puzzle-platformer game Limbo. I developed the game in Gdevelop Game Engine and\u00a0</p>\n<p>it took me 2 days to complete it.\u00a0\u00a0Since 2020 is the year of the rats, I based off my\u00a0</p>\n<p>character design from that.<br/><br/><br/>The metaphor behind the game is all about the competitive struggle for wealth and\u00a0</p>\n<p>power. Basically a rat race.\u00a0The game currently has 1\u00a0level and I am planning to add\u00a0</p>\n<p>more soon. Feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for visiting my game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T04:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07b/07beb501af358a5ee9aaaba5354a4d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stoicorummm"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
