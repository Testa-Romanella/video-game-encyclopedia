Unlimited energy, but each hit reduces your score multiplier</li></ul>POWER-UPS - Kill, Catch or Collect<br/>Each power-up has 2 uses, one when collected by the players ship and the other when shot and destroyed. <br/>If you catch a power-up before it hits the ground then it's effect is increased. (ie. More energy is regained or lasers, rockets or shield last longer.)  A successful catch is indicated by a heart.<br/><br/><strong>Kill, Catch or Collect?</strong><br/><br/>The 4 types and uses are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Energy Power-ups (green)<br/>Kill - creates a large explosion<br/>Catch or Collect - restore player energy<br/><br/>2. Laser Power-ups (red)<br/>Kill - deploys a temporary horizontally firing laser turret <br/>Catch or Collect - grants the player a temporary weapon increase<br/><br/>3.

To do this string a lot of kills together quickly.  Failing to kill anything causes the gauge to drop.<br/><br/><strong>Abductions...of Man &amp; Multipliers</strong><br/>When a certain number of enemies reach the ground a Man will be abducted by a yellow saucer.  As well as abducting Man the saucer takes x3 from your multiplier.<br/><br/>Kill the saucer and allow Man to fall safely to the ground and your x3 multiplier is returned.<br/><br/>The number of enemies reaching the ground needed to trigger an abduction reduces as your multiplier increases.  High multipliers are hard to defend.<br/><br/><strong>Coins</strong><br/>Many in game actions such as killing certain enemies trigger a coin drop.  Pick up the coins for extra points (5pts x multi), catch them for a further bonus (10pts x multi).  Caught coins are indicated by a heart.<br/><br/><strong>Bonuses</strong><br/>Complete any of these in game actions to trigger a bonus coin drop...<br/><br/><ul><li>Arcadia - Survive a level<br/></li><li>Astro Blaster - get a new high multiplier for your current game<br/></li><li>Major Havoc - trigger 2 Astro Blasters within 5 secs<br/></li><li>Missile Command - have 2 remote missile launchers active at the same time<br/></li><li>Laser Zone - have 2 remote lasers active at the same time<br/></li><li>Bomberman - kill lots of enemies in an energy power-up explosion<br/></li><li>Defender - stop any enemy reaching the ground for 30 secs<br/></li><li>Repulsar - Ram an enemy with your shields<br/></li><li>2084 - rescue Man from the saucers 3 times in a row</li></ul><br/>If you like 1982 then checkout this other game made by Binary Zoo:<br/>http://store.steampowered.com/app/338000/Echoes/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T16:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/181cfa30dfae48a2a61a152f01c6e641.jpg", "website": "http://www.binaryzoo.com/1982_page/", "rating": 2.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 227, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Game Creators", "Binary Zoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Game Creators"], "esrb_rating": null}
