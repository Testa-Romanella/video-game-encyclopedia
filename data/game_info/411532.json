The kind of future we want to show in our\u00a0game is one where society has fixed as many social issues as possible. Traffic has been solved by allowing only public transport. Poverty has been fixed by applying a basic income. Discrimination has been stopped by removing genders of every person. Has it really?</p><p>You are a ticket inspector on the subway and don't do your job for income, but for pleasure. Global highscores exist for work quality and efficiency to motivate workers. The player can participate in this score system, but will find that it is impossible to become number one\u00a0and do the job thoroughly. Only when the player starts applying pattern recognition to maximize efficiency and giving fines based on prejudice they have a chance to make it to the top. Our goal is to show that this behaviour of prejudice is a trap humans can always fall into, no matter the drastic approach to get rid of it. It's not a utopia after all.<br/></p><p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Leon van Oldenborgh (HKU)</li><li>Willem van Schaik (HKU)</li><li>Nathan Nieuwenhuizen (HKU)</li><li>Joeri Ridder (HKU)</li><li>Sterre Perquin (UU)</li><li>Jeroen Blok (HKU)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ea/0ea0b1aeacfceb3ed80ff8521e84f0b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Joeriri"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
