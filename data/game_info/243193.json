{"id": 243193, "slug": "arcanist-revival", "name": "Arcanist Revival", "name_original": "Arcanist Revival", "description": "Arcanist Revival is a turn-based strategy game based off of Jagex's Arcanists. Players take turns to utilize one of sixteen spells, chosen by the player beforehand, in order to defeat their opponents. You play as a Mage who can deploy various spells, most of which deal damage, protect you, or summon minions which you can then command. Each player starts with 250 health and, unless they have used a special ability (soul in a cup), will die when it hits zero. After the player dies, he/she may still spectate the game. After each player has had 60 turns, the game will automatically draw, saying the game was out of time. It is worth noting that you can customize your spell book: new players, and new members won't have access to the full range of spells, but can still benefit from examining the options available. You can also customize your appearance and unlock more clothing items by completing achievements or purchasing them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145ba05b94316746cebc2a8c11d3f7b7.jpg", "website": "https://www.arcanistrevival.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Selector Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Selector studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
