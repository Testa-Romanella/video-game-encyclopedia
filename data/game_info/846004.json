I may have taken it slightly too literally.</p>\n<p>Control with WASD keys. Hit stuff to get some physics and sound effects.<br/></p>\n<p>The concept here is a demolition derby but with farm equipment. My main inspiration was the battle mode of Crash Team Racing. Unfortunately, I had a very rough time getting the combine to play well physics and I'm still unhappy with the outcome.</p>\n<p>Given the amount of time I spent making the model sort of behave like a vehicle I didn't have much left to get a game into it. I had big plans for points based obstacle smash and a competitive AI but that's for another time.<br/></p>\n<p>Github Link - https://github.com/RichTeaMan/combine-derby<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T18:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b1bd8e555f3ff684972d3845ec4db4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RichTeaMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
