This is less of a game and more of a prototype/proof of concept. However, I enjoyed working on it, and enjoyed the mechanics themselves so much that I fully intend to expand on it, and turn it into a full game. Due to life, I unfortunately ran out of time before i could really flesh it out for the jam, but please enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T07:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93eb86bacf75b0b2e3bf00e19954d675.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gatorsoup"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
