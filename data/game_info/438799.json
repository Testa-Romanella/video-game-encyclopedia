I spent most of my time actually building the level and what not.\" -\u00a0Maxim Veligan - @Veligains</p>\n<p><strong>Pixel Artists:</strong></p>\n<p>\"This finally gave me a chance to learn Asesprite and it was really fun and definitely learned some of the complications of determining the pixel resolution correctly before wasting too much time.\" - Jenny Yao, @bakedbreadjen</p>\n<p>Austin - @blahahaustin</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Jenny Yao - @bakedbreadjen</p>\r\nHiccups:\r\n<p>We ended up not having time for finalizing the mechanics of the boss and didn\u2019t have time to create the battle music for the boss battle. Even with taking that out, we realized we didn't set up a way for the player to exit out easily, so you just need to exit out the window.</p>\n<p>We had a storyline laid out but didn't have time to incorporate that into the game</p>\n<p><strong>Intro Scene Text:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy: This library is my home, my saving grace. Although, my memory is a bit fuzzy on how long I've been here...\r\nNo matter, I'll soon be able to destroy the watchmaker and protect my precious library. I'll forever be my library's guardian spirit.\r\nHe cannot and shall not harm The Aurayzeon Library</p>\n<p><strong>Before the Boss Battle:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wagner: We don't need libraries, they're filled with long lost knowledge that nobody cares to read anymore! The Internet has taken over so I'll take your ruins and add it to my collection!</p>\n<p>Percy: How dare you! Libraries are relics of knowledge, power beyond your imagination! My power flourishes and shall destroy you in the name of Aurayzeon!</p>\n<p><strong>Outro Scene Text:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy: The Watchmaker has been defeated!
