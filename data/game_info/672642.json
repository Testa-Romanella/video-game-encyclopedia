Get to the portal to finish each level and try to get the fastest time.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Right Click / Space - Ground Pound</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Left Click / Shift - Dash</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>WASD / Arrows- Move</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>R - Restart Level</em></strong></p>\n<p>I decided I'd take part in the compo this time, since I always do game jams alone anyway so I figured it made sense.</p>\n<p>I thought of the idea for this game since \"Unstable\" made me think of earthquakes, which made me think of a game where you could ground pound enemies and send them flying with the shockwave. The reason there are tables in the game and not enemies is because I didn't think I'd have time to make the AI, and the other idea I had was anything to do with tables (Uns-table).</p>\n<p>The mechanics of the game are pretty similar to the last game jam game I completed, but I decided I'd use this game jam to test my speed and level design skills, because the last game jam I did was a week long whereas now I've only got 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, I hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T04:40:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c90/c9013b15acd4c49ada0ac22f98641a94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Anogrm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
