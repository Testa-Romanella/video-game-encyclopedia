I planned to add a lot more content to the game but at least for now I think this is the end for 'Tanker'. Enjoy and let me know your score in the comments, feedback is also greatly appreciated!</p><p>font by: Daniel Linssen (m5x7)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:44:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51e9dc84731bffff7ffd9810b4a570cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Rafferty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
