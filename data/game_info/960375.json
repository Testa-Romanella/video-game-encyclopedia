The original cast of Jules, Quincy, Haru, Morgan and Kyun are joined by 4 newcomers \u2013 Canadian martial artist Dakota, Brazilian skater boy Faren, Australian police officer Sydney and Hong Kong airline pilot Bao, all with their own unique backstories and voiced in Japanese. (Some still have cute little foreign accents, but bear with them, they're trying their best!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>As you play through dozens of challenging brick-breaking stages, you\u2019ll gradually get closer to the boys by spending points you\u2019ve earned in a new in-game shop system to unlock sexy outfits and background images to assemble custom dioramas in Dressing Room mode. Each of the 9 characters starts in regular male attire and will crossdress in the feminine outfits you acquire, from uniforms and skirts to swimsuits and lingerie.<br/><br/>But don\u2019t get cocky! The brick-breaking stages of Pretty Battle will gradually increase in difficulty. In this mode, you\u2019ll control a twin-tailed fighter wielding a beam saber and swat a ball towards block targets above. Some blocks will drop power-ups, while others will take multiple strikes to bust. As the action intensifies, enemy ships will appear and fire at you, propellers will deflect your shots, turrets will track your position and more, adding a bullet hell element that\u2019s ultimately tough but fair.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Once you\u2019ve cleared all 36 Pretty Battle stages, you can also push your limits with endless challenges. How long can you endure?<br/><br/><strong>Finish the main game and you\u2019ll discover even deeper secrets in Naked Mode, adding practically infinite replay value and fanservice to keep you coming back for more quality time with the boys!</strong><br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>\u2022\tBattle through 36 stages of brick-breaking arcade action!<br/>\u2022\tMeet a cast of 9 crossdressing \u201cotokonoko\u201d characters, all voiced in Japanese.<br/>\u2022\tChange ball speeds, collect power-ups, dodge enemy attacks and deflect incoming fire.<br/>\u2022\tMaster 2 unique game modes, including endless challenges for unlimited replay value!<br/>\u2022\tEarn points to exchange for new outfits and backdrops in any order you desire.<br/>\u2022\tAssemble custom dioramas using the characters and clothing you\u2019ve unlocked.<br/>\u2022\tClear all stages to unlock Naked Mode, fully uncensored with no patch required!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T04:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84b167103cc6926b5e43b5fe11ff015d.jpg", "website": "https://www.eastasiasoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EastAsiaSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["eastasiasoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
