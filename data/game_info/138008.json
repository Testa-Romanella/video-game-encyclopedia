It's also my first solo project, after six years of working on much larger team projects.<br/>After all that work on slow pachyderms, I wanted to take a stab at something smaller, faster, and fun.<br/>So, I dusted a gameplay idea I hid in a drawer a couple of years back, I set it up as a 30 minutes-a-day project and started working on it during lunch breaks. When the prototype was welcomed quite enthusiastically by the first testers, I decided to make it real.</p>\n<p><strong>Razerwire:Nanowars\u2122 is a simple and light game, focused on replayability, and includes a nice set of upgrades, achievements, and high scores to satisfy the progression geek in all of us.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>RW:NW<strong>\u2122</strong> Requires a Mouse to be played properly.</p>\n<p>If you get to have half the fun playing it as I had making it, I think you'll cherish it!</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br/>Emiliano, @DokHgn</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to maneuver a monomolecular filament (the RazerWire) in a way to protect your generators and kill the enemies assaulting them.</li><li>Survive through endless waves of attackers with increasing difficulty.\u00a0</li><li>Avoid hits on the Generators</li><li>Use the Wire for the kills</li><li>Use left and right mouse click to activate some powerups (Antimatter Blaster and PowerWave).</li><li>Progress is styled in a bit of a \"rogue-like\" approach: Survive as many waves as possible, and when you die use the earned points to unlock upgrades and powerups, then restart the fight (there are checkpoints, no worries!).</li></ul>\n\n\n<ul><li>Multiple enemy types with several variants each :<ul><li>7 Movement types including Teleport, Accelerating Zig zags and Escaping from the Wire</li><li>4 Shooting modes including homing missiles, scrambling bullets and all-around shooting</li><li>2 Armor types</li></ul></li><li>Multiple unlockable upgrades for the Wire including Shields, Armor, Health and Recovery Times</li><li>Up to 7 powerups including Anabolishields, Nanoblades and Chrono Molasses</li><li>Procedural difficulty increase in the endless waves progression</li></ul>\n<p>If you liked what you saw, feel free to follow me and RWNW<strong>\u2122</strong> on Twitter\u00a0, some support is always a good gazoline for productivity ;)</p>\n\n\n<p>In a future far away where humanity colonises most of the galaxy, the entire world starts being exterminated by no apparent enemy.</p>\n<p>When scientists figure out that the killers are nano-sized virus-like aliens, Dr.Illerotsap modifies a medical tool, a monomolecular filament used for nano-scale medical operations and turns it into a weapon against the enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The RazeWire was born.</p>\n\n\n<p>My thanks go first and foremost to my family and to Jenny, for supporting my mad attempts at making a living with a job that I love.</p>\n<p>To Olaf for sharing my office throughout the whole development, drooling over my flip flops and covering the floor with hair and love.</p>\n<p>To my friend Ottavio from Mash Machine for having made the super cool music for the game.</p>\n<p>To Siim and Mikk for the moral support throughout the project.</p>\n<p>http://twitter.com/RzW_NW</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c2/3c2ade55799a5f6822c7586b93c31ef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sgt.H"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
