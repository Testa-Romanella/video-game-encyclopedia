Make sure to time your jumps over incoming attacks or risk being knocked off the tree yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your peck attack is fast but weak, the wing attack is medium speed and medium damage, and your tail attack is slow but deals lots of damage. However, the knockoff chance is weighted based on instability % (number at the top) and type of damage (so slow attacks have a higher chance of knocking opponent off). Additionally, slower attacks have a higher chance of interrupting the opponent\u2019s current attack.\r\n</p>\n<p>And be careful! The enemies get harder as you go up branches. They learn more moves (like jumping over attacks or dashing forward/backwards) and also deal more damage, are more aggressive, and more!
