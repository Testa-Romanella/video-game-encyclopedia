Technically it has most of the parts a game like this requires however it lacks the fun factor to make you want to play it more than once. I've uploaded this to hopefully get some feedback on what could make it better so please leave a comment below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T06:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67b2fb6378fcc5c63024bbbfe5acc45b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Curious Dog Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
