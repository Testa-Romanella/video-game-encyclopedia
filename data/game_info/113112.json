In stone form you are invincible to all enemies BUT you lose power to remain in stone form. Collect the blue power gems to replenish your power. <br/> <br/>FLESH TO STONE was made in Haxe with HaxeFlixel. I used the help of bfxr and GarageBand to make the audio for the game. I used Hexels 2 and paint.NET to create the graphics. <br/> <br/>Linux is untested currently and there are hiccups in HTML. The best performances are using the native OSX and Windows builds.</p><p>PATCHED: New controls to prevent browser scrolling<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/6778b5ea2b72dcda7f7bffea4706529f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["tedbolt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
