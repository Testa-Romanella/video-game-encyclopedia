To fix them aim at the tank of the center and use your blowtorch to repair them. Also, tanks have a limited time to be fixed, so be aware of the timer in your HUD. Failing to fix tanks in time wil make you lose, so stay alert soldier. On top of that, enemies will constantly be attacking you, therefore use your rifle to destroy them.</p>\n<p>When you kill enemies they will drop blue metals at the big front door of the hangar (when you enter there it will be behind you). I left a computer that you can use to spend those blue metals and buy ammo, get some powerups, recruit pilots and even conquer some lands from the comodity of the hangar! How cool is that?</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> I got some intel about those bastards that will be attacking you: the two legged mech makes radial damage, the four legged one constantly aims at you and will shoot its cannon once it is close enough, and the flying one will make you go slow and also damage you, so look above you soldier.</p>\n<p><strong>PS2:</strong> The computer I left you has different products to buy and manage: Powerups usually cost more than 100 M, ammo costs 50 M, recruiting pilots 10 M, and, if you get at least 5 pilots, you can throw away 100 M and conquer lands to generate extra metal per 2 seconds .</p>\n<p>//END-OF-TRANSMISSION//<br/></p>\n\n<p>Feedback?
