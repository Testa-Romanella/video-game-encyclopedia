I thought this is an amazing new genre of horror game. This game is inspired by the legendary Cookie Clicker game. This game is very short and have a slight spook to it. It may look normal in the beginning but it gets weirder and weirder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this game for the LowRezJam 2021 and it comes with great limitation. I actually want to add more effects such as lighting,\u00a0shadows, etc. but unable to do so due to the game jam's restriction.</p>\n<p>This game has only 64x36 pixels in resolution therefor I am unable to add extra effects.</p>\n\n<p>That's how small the game actually is. It is just scaled up to make it playable. The game is scaled to 640x360.</p>\n<p>The slider in the credits room is only to indicate the time stamp and it is considered as control. The slider may be more than 64x64 pixels but it depends on browser's GUI and not part of the game</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Tap/Click (space bar is available for the second level but not necessary)</p>\n<p>The game is mainly made for browsers that supports HTML5. But if somehow you have a 30 years old\u00a0browser and unable to play it you can download it too. But the size might be HUGE due to NW.js container. The original HTML5 game is only 10 MB.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is\u00a0<strong>VERY RECOMMENDED TO PLAY VIA BROWSER.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b39aa6046d41b2ad6abbc39f8c3dbd3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Freadel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
