It is highly unfinished and doesn't have an ending. Also there is a lot of bugs.\u00a0 This game will never be finished or get patched. You can still play the game if you'd like and download the soundtrack, which features a lot of unused tracks I never had the time to implement. While being unfinished the game still has 3 different areas to explore, a town and a boss to fight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49f35a77aca48bbfa023b16c3dc4500c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S34_M0NST3R"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
