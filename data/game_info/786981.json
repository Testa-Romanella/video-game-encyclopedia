It\u2019s focused on the type of puzzles where you slide across a frozen surface and can\u2019t stop until you hit a wall. I\u2019ve always though these puzzles where kind of neat but in most games I\u2019ve seen them in they\u2019re incredibly easy and basic. So I made game that features them with increasing difficulty and complexity. It\u2019s not a long game but the difficulty ramps up quickly.   </p>\n<p>You play as a mysterious protagonist who finds himself wandering trough a strange cave system covered in snow and ice. Can you find out what fate awaits this young lad by the end of the game?\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T13:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cd/4cda887b828c48b5992af45897110a07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrystalCreation"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
