It should only take a few minutes to complete.</p>\n<p>[ Slight epilepsy warning... and there might also be blood, depending on what you pick. ] <br/></p>\n<p>Most the sprites featured are just out of the sketching stage, but the backgrounds have already gone through inking... the forrest scene has to be recoloured.<br/></p>\n<p>Also; <strong>Mr. Robert's and Mr. Tatsuki's sprites have to be reworked</strong>, along with the audio, but otherwise the script for the included part is finalized, the rest is yet to be written.</p>\n<p>The original idea for this story and the first drafts of this act was written by my sister, but now it's just me...<br/></p>\n<p>Everything else; the art, audio, programming, etc. was(/is?) done by me.<br/></p>\n<p>There might also be a few issues that I did not catch... but, such is development... *shrug*</p>\n<p>Either way...
