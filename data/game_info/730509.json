In one of their mortal races, Raccoon's steering wheel broke and the poor was left unable to control his car. But even though both drivers are extremely competitive, Cat couldn't leave his friend in trouble and suggested that they share the wheel. Now the one in trouble is the player who has to control both cars with one steering wheel. What exactly does duality represent in this game? - you might ask and we answer: friendship and rivalry - these are the central themes. Well, also 2 cars, 2 animals, 2 roads, 2 artists... we can go on, eh?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:00:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2efe05e9c3327ee4762eee6620a6494c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aburrron", "Man from Space"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
