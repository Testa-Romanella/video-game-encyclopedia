Along the way, they will meet different people who still live in the ancient areas and learn what happened over the course of history for these places to fall and become abandoned. As they make their way across the dangerous platforms, they may also have to solve some problems to get to the next area. At the end of the game, once Aeolian has made it back to their house, wrote about their day, and has gone to bed. Aeolian will wake up the next day and set out to do the same thing again because their memory resets every morning.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T04:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f397f1ac62902ad36d0f5c20a6638525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shroop"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
