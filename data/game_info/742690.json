Built tall with strong weaponry, the towers have protected their kind for years. Now, we the goblins, have found villages on the outskirts of their civilizations. I, the great shaman leader, shall use my magics to help our kind invade these villages. These humans harvest pigs. The pigs will be our trade to get the stronger of our kind to help invade more villages.\u00a0We came to this world to conquer this realm and we will do it with the power of the PIG!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0This is a reverse tower defense game where you play as the invading force vs the enemies towers. You unlock new units and spells as you complete each level for 8 levels in total. The invading units have to break through the towers to attack the village. If the units get all the way through, the units are refunded for the next wave. Continue until your units get through and destroy the village\u00a0or you run out of currency.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Use spells to assist in the assault. You can protect your hoard or crush your enemies with such magic. Each wave and over time, you regenerate your mana partially, so feel free to use your spells often. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T08:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d59c2568458ca3d5ad9eb59bec8c7b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Biofire Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
