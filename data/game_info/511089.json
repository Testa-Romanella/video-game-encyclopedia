You and the other play have 7 hitpoints, but be careful because bullets you shoot can bounce back and cause damage to yourself. You can only move side to side with your battleship, so come up with a strategy to dodge and juke your opponent and his or her bullets while shooting him or her. Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Player 1:</p>\n<ul><li>A and D to move</li><li>W or S to shoot</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>J and L to move</li><li>I or K to shoot</li></ul>\n<p>Game:</p>\n<ul><li>Spacebar to reset (only after someone has died)</li><li>Scroll wheel to change the music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/97902a4851a9c39b385a156d319e1880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
