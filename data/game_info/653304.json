Cooper had a thought - What if the spiders just left the shed and came into the house, or worse: What if they came for his bunnies!</p>\n<p>Cooper's 3 bunnies, Pippin, Hiedi and Bunbun follow him around everywhere. He became worried that the spiders would get them. We consoled him, we told him that's one of the reasons\u00a0why we were spraying the shed to begin with.</p>\n<p>He was still worried.</p>\n<p>That night, after a huge gaming session on his PC, Cooper fell into a deep sleep. He started dreaming about his bunnies, the spiders, his PC, the lot!
