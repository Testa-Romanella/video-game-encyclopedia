I've lost way more times than you.<br/></p>\n<p>The 9x9 grid is randomly filled with a number of mines <strong>depending on your difficulty settings.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The numbers on revealed squares indicate the number of neighbouring cells (<em>0-&gt;8</em>) that contain mines</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Your score is calculated based on the risk level</strong>. E.g. If you happen to choose a high-risk square that has 8 mines surrounding it, you receive 8 points from that choice. If you choose a low-risk square that has no mines surrounding it, you get zero points from that choice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The current best is: 41 points! Please let me know if you top that</em> (and screenshot it if possible. I'll update this!)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a5748938ea86fb4953fac3737a01c37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tempored Insanity Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
