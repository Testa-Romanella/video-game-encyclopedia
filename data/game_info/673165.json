It's not meant to be a realistic flight simulator but a fast-paced arcade action experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>-Two tutorial levels and one demo mission (more levels will be added, while the development goes on)</p>\n<p>-4 different weapon types</p>\n<p>-Hack other spaceships to control them and use the enemy's own weapons against them</p>\n\n<p>This is just a gameplay demo, so don't expect a highly polished game. My main goal for now is to gather feedback on the concept and the user experience. What did you enjoy? What was frustrating? Was something still unclear after the tutorial? Leave a comment in the Feedback thread to help me improve the game.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e3017596162e79f62f1293d5604f03d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["INH Entertainment"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
