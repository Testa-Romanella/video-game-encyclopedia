One theory is the Big Bang Theory. It states that the \r\nuniverse started as a pinprick of matter then suddenly expanded. \r\nScientists claim that one second after the initial \"explosion\" there was\r\n an event called the Lepton Epoch. The Lepton Epoch was where matter and\r\n Anti-Matter collided into one another, annihilating both particles. \r\nWhat did this event look like? How did it play out in the end? Take \r\ncontrol of a Lepton and find out in this addicting game, Lepton Epoch.</p><p>Music By DST<br/>\r\nNarration By Svox TTS Oliver</p><p>Only for Windows</p><p>Please feel free to donate to help me make more games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/106118a3d9b3542fc28fc79c5e1ab421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob16682"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
