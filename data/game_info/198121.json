Little Dotty lived a life full of happiness and joy there. Raised only by her mother, she did not have one single care in the whole wide world.

Because who else could do it but little Dotty? Rumour has it that the recipe has been split into four fragments and scattered throughout the land. Whoever would do such a thing is beyond me. There is not much time. Little Dotty has to hurry to find all fragments of the recipe and return to the village.<br/>Thankfully she possesses the awesomesauce power of Zenpassana\u2122 meditation!</p>\n<p><strong>~ Controls ~</strong>\n<br/>Arrows to move, Ctrl to run (drains power)\r\n<br/>While not running, press the key shown to meditate (Zenpassana\u2122 style)<br/>Ctrl / Cmd to advance text, Return to skip entire dialogue</p><p>Created within 48h for Ludum Dare 39 (Theme: Running out of power)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6c2be0647bd6fae1f76b212821a5ff9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Erkberg"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
