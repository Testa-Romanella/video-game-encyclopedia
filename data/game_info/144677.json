No one watches the number of \r\ndead people spiking every single day. No one looks the street beggars in\r\n the eye.<br/><br/>With the help of a group of concerned citizens, you, El\r\n Heroe, have broken into the Presidential Skyscraper and stolen the \r\nPride back. The effect was clear and immediate. No one knew what had \r\nhappened, but everyone could feel how the blood in their veins got hot \r\nand pumping once again, just like in the good ol' times, when going out \r\nto the streets represented no more than a 7% chance of getting randomly \r\nshot.<br/><br/>The magnificent Presidential Skyscraper was built to \r\nwithstand the harshest of attacks by the enemies of the State and its \r\npeople, so it locked down as soon as Mexican Pride went missing from its\r\n usual spot, right next the Presidential urinal.<br/><br/>The great \r\nplanification labour carried out by the revolutionary leaders of the new\r\n Mexico was flawless and, without too much hassle, El Heroe was able to \r\nget to the rooftop of the Majestic Tower of Evil built by El Presidente.\r\n From there he jumped to freedom, celebrity and, most probably, \r\nmartyrdom. <br/><br/>It is upon you to decide wether this story ends \r\ntragically or not. Will El Heroe fullfil his Destino and become the \r\nliberator of Mexico? Or will the evil forces of imperialistic control \r\nhave the upperhand in the pursuit of the century? <br/><br/>Be quick and nimble, and escape from the savage paws of El Presidente.<br/><br/><br/>This game was made by the following awesome cyborgs:<br/><br/><strong>Coding // Alberto \"CJ\" Zorrilla<br/><br/>Graphics // Ruben \"Not Assigned\" Galvan<br/><br/>Music &amp; Sounds // Luis Casares &amp; Miguel Garces<br/><br/>Story // Kiril Kravchenko</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a9003bd3daa464e50d9e97064f1ae5c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["abysmal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
