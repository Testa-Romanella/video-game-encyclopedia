With the new Fan Request mode, you can choose your path \n      to music stardom and rock the house! On-the-go rockers earn more fans \n      and fame by performing their favorite tunes in different styles (e.g. \n      avoiding note bombs, hitting a 300 note streak or playing different \n      guitar tracks) as requested by their fans while they move back and forth \n      between venues (non-linear gameplay). Utilizing the familiar Guitar Hero \n      Guitar Grip peripheral, gamers can shred through 28 master tracks of the \n      hottest Modern Rock. With this third release of the best selling Guitar \n      Hero On Tour collection, players will be able to stream up to 80 songs \n      in multiplayer mode.* Rock On! (Other Guitar Hero: On Tour games sold \n      separately.)\n    </p><p>\n      Note: not compatible with Nintendo DSi\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-24T19:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/704/704d82d04756ecc2de6bc338d423df8e.jpg", "website": "http://www.guitarhero.com/ghot/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 406, "game_series_count": 18, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
