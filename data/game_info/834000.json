Attacking consistently builds the player's Charge Bar.<br/></p>\n<p>CHARGE BAR :<br/>The higher a player's Charge Bar, the more Electrical Damage they deal. Additionally, at higher tiers of Charge the player will gain a Chain Lightning effect on their attacks dealing more Electrical damage to nearby enemies. Note that at higher charge levels, the player is more suceptible to incoming damage (up to 50% increase in Damage taken at max level) due to the characters electrical instability.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL ATTACKS :<br/>Players can expend tiers of their Charge Bar to perform Special Attacks, this drains their Charge Bar reducing their Electrical Damage output and Chain Lightning in exchange for powerful attacks and aiding survivability due to the inrease to incoming damage a player risks at higher Charge Bar levels.</p>\n<p>ENEMY DEATH :<br/>Should and Enemy be drained of its health by incoming Physical Damage, it will die. However, should an Enemy's Overcharge Bar be filled by incoming Electrical Damage they will instead enter an invulnerable, stunned state and will flash red. This counts down to an AoE explosion dealing Physical Damage to Player and Enemies alike. Players must be wary when enemies are in this state, but can also opt to use this to their advantage by knocking enemies into the explosive radius (or hitting the stunned robot into them)</p>\n\n<p>COMBOS<br/>----------------------------------</p>\n<p>Light Combo 1 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light, Light, Light</p>\n<p>Light Combo 2 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light, Light, Light, Heavy (Launch)</p>\n<p>Light Combo 3 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light, Light, Heavy</p>\n<p>Light Combo 4 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light, Heavy, Light (Can chain Light Attacks indefinelty from this point in the combo)</p>\n\n<p>Heavy Combo 1 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Heavy, Heavy, Heavy</p>\n<p>Heavy Combo 2 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy (Launch)</p>\n<p>Heavy Combo 3 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Heavy, Light, Light, Heavy</p>\n<p>Heavy Combo 4 :\u00a0 \u00a0 Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Light, Light, Heavy, Heavy</p>\n\n<p>Air Combo :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light, Light, Light</p>\n<p>Air Heavy :\u00a0 \u00a0 Heavy (Knocks Enemy to the floor allowing the player to start attacking immediately upon landing)\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Light Stinger :\u00a0 \u00a0 Light (While holding W [Mouse and Keyboard] or Up on the Left Analog Stick [Gamepad])</p>\n<p>Heavy Stinger :\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Heavy (While holding W [Mouse and Keyboard] or Up on the Left Analog Stick [Gamepad])</p>\n<p>Defensive Attack :\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Heavy (While holding S [Mouse and Keyboard] or Down on the Left Analog Stick [Gamepad] AND are locked on to an enemy)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T09:45:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ac/9ac6d3b94b379b61c8f69805a2bab4fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Billy Kane"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
