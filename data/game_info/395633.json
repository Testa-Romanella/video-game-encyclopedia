Every mouse, once fully grown up, will have to fulfill this important task.</p>\n<p>Through history, the tradition lived, even during the mice\u2019s hardest of times, caused by famines, diseases, or predators. But on the past decades, it has become more and more difficult for\u00a0<strong>the Little Mices</strong>\u00a0to do their job. Life took a dark turn, as the human evolution did. Children\u2019s bedroom are harder to reach, natural predators now live in the human\u2019s houses. Besides, to the humans, the mice are now considered as vermin, as parasites : they no longer are the enchanting little beings that had to take care of their children\u2019s teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To preserve the young pups, the\u00a0<strong>Elder Council</strong>, composed of the wisest mice in the tribe, decided to create a rite of passage for the young mice\u2019s coming of age. All the young pups are kept from the truth by the adults, so they can enjoy their childhood as a joyful time. The adults take care of the children\u2019s teeth, while allowing the young mice to grow old and thrive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rite of passage marks the end of the joyful young times for mice. They then have to face the sad truth : collecting children\u2019s teeth, once a sacred mission, has turned into a terribly dangerous, sometimes deadly, task.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Growing Up</strong></em>\u00a0is a short platform game in which the myth of the\u00a0<strong>french Tooth Fairy\u00a0</strong>and passage into adulthood are seen in a new light. In this world, collecting teeth under\u00a0 children\u2019s pillows is a sacred mission for mice. It used to be done in harmony with humans, but things have changed.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Growing Up is the first game produced by three students from University Bordeaux Montaigne, for\u00a0<strong>The Icehouse Jam 2019</strong>\u00a0: Kilian Fichou, R\u00e9my L\u00e9tang, No\u00e9mie Marphay.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Moves\u00a0</strong>: Up, Down, Left, Rigth Keys</p>\n<p><strong>Inventory\u00a0</strong>: F</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse computer</strong>\u00a0: slide the objects to other ones to interact</p>\n<p><strong>Space bar</strong>\u00a0: start over the level</p>\n<p><strong>Esc</strong>\u00a0: leave the game</p>\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We would like to sincerely thank Yoann Charue, who composed the music, Charlotte Dup\u00e9 for english localization, and finally our testers\u2019 feedback.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:35:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27e/27e15752ccaa08e65c6792997d236c0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nokire Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
