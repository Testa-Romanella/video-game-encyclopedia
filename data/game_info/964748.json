You win when there are either only healthy cells remaining, or only infected cells remaining. The more cells remain, the more points you'll get to level-up your vaccine with unique upgrades!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCarefully choose the order of your body samples, select your upgrades wisely, and try to make the most efficient and accessible vaccine to save as many people as you can around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAsk your doctor if Metavaxx is right for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-11T04:56:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb246a83ca60f3294b551f939c8fa533.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["PUNKCAKE Delicieux"], "esrb_rating": null}
