What seems to be a normal visit for the two tourists becomes a haunted mystery. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLore: Curse Of The Elemental is the first installment of the Lore game series. Adventure, horror, action, and mystery lie ahead. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was inspired by Uncharted, Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, and The Mummy and is sure to surprise all newcomers as it makes its own unique footprint in the adventure genre. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis short adventure involves mystery, puzzle solving, third person perspective, shotgun shooting, jump scares, and many cinematic cutscenes.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe location is based off of a real location in Ireland that is said to be actually haunted. My wife and I visited in 2019 and were greatly inspired by our experience there. All purchases of this game will be used to finance our next game Lore: The Secret Order.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBefore playing the game I recommend to visit the \"options\" menu and select the optimize option. This should configure the game to match your system.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlease enjoy my first game! :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T03:52:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f07d06cd678ed6eb2bc8ca26d22dfb8d.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/GrantFilmsLLC", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 484, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fred Grant Studios", "Fred Grant"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fred Grant Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
