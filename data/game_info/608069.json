The game uses a mix of resource management of medications, medical supplies, and money to help emphasize the stresses diabetics must go through financially, and managing blood sugars to simulate the stress of keeping one\u2019s health under control. The game focuses around an unnamed diabetic who recently lost their job and insurance, and must manage to afford their life-saving insulin and other medical supplies despite this. The player is able to earn money by working odd jobs, or improve their health by exercising, both in the form of minigames.</p>\n<p>The game was made for\u00a0anyone who isn\u2019t familiar with the intricacies of Type One Diabetes, although everyone old enough to understand the game is encouraged to play. The game features four short minigames in its release form, and multiple ways to manage diabetes, including insulin pens, insulin pumps, blood sugar testing, and constant glucose monitoring.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend playing the tutorial first.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0d/f0dbbb8233d85db2b70bb6cd0fbc074a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weeabetes"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
