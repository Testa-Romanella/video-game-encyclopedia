For this project, the creative constraint assigned to us was to make a sandbox style game from a first person perspective based on an existing urban issue. I was assigned the urban issue of trash and pollution. Realizing that studying and accurately depicting these issues takes years, let alone a week, I have chosen to represent the issue in the most abstract and open-ended way by designing a digital interactive experience which should be both open to interpretation and also a contemplation on the emotions that lead us to cause this issue in the first place. I attempted to imply our creation of meaning itself and how it's pursuit is sometimes overwhelming, consuming and ultimately crushing.<br/> <br/>While I accept that my project is far from perfect, I was satisfied to take up the challenge and strive to deliver a worthy contemplation on a pressing issue.</p><p> <strong>Controls-</strong></p><p><strong>Use Mouse to look around.<br/>Use W,A,S,D or arrow keys to move.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b02/b0201643a1a992051425f060a8b4d1b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tanish Karmakar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
