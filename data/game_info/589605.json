This game is inspired by the retro shoot-em-up games from the 90s so I naturally made the aspect ration of 4:3 and a score system.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game, I hope you will like it and\u00a0\u00a0good luck to everyone else that participated on this Jam!!!\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:59:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b111eb3dc11c41f34985dabdb0a0519.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["maaaaaaaaaani"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
