After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Just when you thought you could enjoy your honeymoon on the beautiful Island of Buyan, you learn its Prince has been assassinated and the artifact providing the island's ancient defense of invisibility has been blown up. It looks like some powerful and evil force is attempting to control Buyan and enslave its people. Grab your weapons, Hero, it's time to fight for freedom again. Your prize could be the throne of Buyan.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"HOLV\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 61 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The game uses File Sharing in iTunes.
