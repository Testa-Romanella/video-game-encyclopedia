Each person can take away any number of stones from one of the piles. Whoever takes the last stone wins. The catch is that each turn\u00a0when a move is made, that move\u00a0can be rejected by the other person,\u00a0as long as there is\u00a0another move. Rejection can only be used once per turn.\u00a0There are 3 levels in total. In each level, you\u00a0have a winning strategy, but it's up to you to find it. Level 1 is not that difficult,\u00a0since it has only a single pile of stones.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T09:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbde88bddbf1b9675a52456d1f6d34cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matrix67"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
