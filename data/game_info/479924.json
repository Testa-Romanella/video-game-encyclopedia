It works with gamepads, HOTAS flight sticks and actual drone transmitters that Windows supports.</p>\n<p>I also love VR and looking to port a VR version of this as well. Link to some test footage with my Rift, which I could also look to releasing if there is interest in it.</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T03:21:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ce/0cea492e47d31556719041ca8a7c1cd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EggMan28"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
