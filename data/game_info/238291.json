What makes this app unique is its ease-of-use, universal binary, and the 4-Player scorekeeping with point tracking. Also, the About tab will help the beginner know how to play Cricket but it is also an extremely useful reference for the experienced player--especially the dart board set-up details.<br/><br/>If you are looking to test drive this app, a free version called \"ezCricketScore LE\" is available. The free version is the same app but has a small ad banner at the bottom and does not include the 4-Player mode.<br/><br/>Finally, we need your help to make the app better!  Development requires continual improvement, so please provide your feedback to help make that happen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:17:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c9/7c9630a3c2c76b350c889ef42564b8fb.jpg", "website": "http://www.t100software.com/ezCricketScore/home.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["t100software.com"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Ryan Tanner"], "esrb_rating": null}
