Rage over the hard to see platforms and the frustration of having to restart the whole game if you fail! The game is in early development with more levels coming soon! The blocks on a big platform that have particals flying out of it marks the end of the level. I cant add text though because of the text becoming purple blocks so sorry about that:(</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Music: VanossGaming </p><p>Full version of game will cost money</p><p>Project X 1.1 update notes:<br/>-Added flashlight to help see certain platforms<br/>-Added another level<br/>-Height and length of jump varies depending on how you jumped of a platform<br/>-Fixed particales on level ending blocks<br/>-Player now slides when you stop walking but only a few feet</p><p>-Main Menu coming soon</p><p>IMPORTANT: For some unknown reason all of the games I have been working on have deleted fro my computer I have also lost my 3d models, my code, and my sounds, I will no longer be able to update the following: The Beta Batch series, Silent Screams, and Project X.
