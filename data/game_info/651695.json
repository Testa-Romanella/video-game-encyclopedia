{"id": 651695, "slug": "the-great-catposters-unnamed-game-demo-2", "name": "The Great Catposter's Unnamed Game Demo #2", "name_original": "The Great Catposter's Unnamed Game Demo #2", "description": "<p>-Enter the battle room and fight through 4 waves of increasing difficulty.\r\n </p>\n<p>-Press 1 For Full Screen, And 2 For Windowed.\r\n </p>\n<p>-Press TAB when in Battle To Pause and View Instructions\r\n </p>\n<p>-Press and hold N during the Prewave to start battle.\r\n </p>\n<p>-Press N after selecting the main character or a cover object to  bring up the Heal/Repair module. If you have pool points left, and the  selected object has taken damage, you can press up and down to inc/dec  health. This is needed for when you or the cover object(desks) have  taken damage during the previous battle wave.\r\n </p>\n<p>-During battle, press J to enter Shooting Mode, and K to return to  \u00a0Move Mode. During shooting mode, press up and down to aim at the row  above you, right in front of you, and right below you. The closest enemy  will be auto targeted. This is the only attack you have for this demo.\r\n </p>\n<p>-When positioned behind cover, and NOT in shooting mode, you go into  cover mode(character is crouch). When in this mode you take very reduced  damage from attacks. Front facing attacks are greatly reduced while  attacks from above and below aren't reduced as much. If you stand up to  shoot while behind cover, you lose this defense bonus. Cover objects  take damage when you're hit in cover mode, and they can be destroyed  eventually. You can repair or rebuild a lost cover object during  prewaves by selecting the cover object, pressing N, and then up or down.\r\n </p>\n<p>-You can select any character, and press J to examine their moves. Press up or down to scroll through them.\r\n </p>\n<p>-The symbols next to a character's moves designate the move's  type(not too important atm), spread, and damage. For the spread; the  black lines designate whether the attack hits straight ahead, the row  above the character, the row below, or a combination of the above. By  examining an enemy's spread, you can determine the best angle to attack  from.\r\n -Line of Scrimmage: You'll see how the enemies' side has different  colored tiles. If an enemy is on the border of their tiles and yours,  they can transform your column of tiles into moveable tiles for  themselves(it happens automatically after a set time), decreasing the  amount of space you have to move. You can do the same to push back enemy  tiles. It only works though if the adjacent oppositions tiles are  unoccupied. Hope this helps, let me know if there's anything that's not  making sense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:51:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af6dbda32ae5ec2693e3af6bc206c84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thegreatcatposter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
