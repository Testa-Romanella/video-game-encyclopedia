If you win for your Spryt, you'll be freed from Limbo and be born.\r\nModern times have made these supernatural beings irrelevant or completely forgotten. Any attention they get means their continued existence. You as a soul are looking to escape Limbo, so you must play and win a game that sends you into your next life. In order to compete, you make pacts with different Spryts that aid you in the game. This collaboration means that at least you will never forget that these Spryts exist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T10:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e9a0c6bc076d4aeec4bbb0b3f6cd8c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pajamaguy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
