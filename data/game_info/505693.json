Well for my submission to GMTK I submitted late and didn't get in; same here but the admins are pretty amazing. Terrible joke aside, the way I incorporate the Theme of \"Stuck in a Loop\" is that all the abilities that you are\u00a0able to use are only accesible through a timed loop. Want to shoot that bad guy but you're stuck popping in and out of a bubble? Tough luck you can s-</p>\n<p>Anyway I had lot's of fun creating this game, and I hope you have fun playing it, I'll attach controls down below, and descriptions of all 4 abilities available to the player. Also vote 5 stars on the music just to see if it's possible to rank so high there with nothing to show for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\r\nMACROACTIONA/DMove Left/RightSpaceJumpLeft Mouse ButtonUse Current AbilityEscapePause/Resume\r\n<p><strong>Abilities:<br/></strong></p>\r\nMeleeKill 1 Nearby Enemy per Melee AttackRangedShoot Far Away Enemies at the Direction of your mouse.
