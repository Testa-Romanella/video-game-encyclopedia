You must scuttle along the surface, lobbing smaller aliens at the advancing human landers. You, as the player, need to scuttle your fingers on the keys of your keyboard to move. <strong>BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE TUTORIAL FOR A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE CONTROLS.</strong> This game is only a proof of concept, and I plan to improve on the input mechanic, or perhaps use it in another game, depending on feedback.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: This build originally also contained my clone of the original game by Tomohiro Nishikado (1978), which I reproduced with good intentions, and by no means for commercial gain. I have removed the menu option to play this original game and the game files have been mostly removed, however the tutorial will still instruct you on the controls.</em></p><p><strong>As always, feedback is appreciated.
