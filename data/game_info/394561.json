[it's a happy game, don't worry]<br/>Realy short game about a person (the gender is up to you!) dealing with a breakup. Kinda sad and horror-ish, 2 endings, a sad one for the player and a happy one for the lesbians! This GBStudio games are very personal and very catartic to me, so if you don't like it, a have a bunch of other games about lesbians being happy with each other, enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea95f96e67e3feb15882679cadbbd4b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andchan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
