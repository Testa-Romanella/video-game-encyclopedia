This is a FANMADE game of the 2018 HIT horror game <strong>Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning</strong></p>\n\r\nThe Story of the Game\r\n<p>One of your friends was late to catch the bus and he had eating practice so he forgot all of his notebooks at school. He wants you to go and fetch his notebooks since you live closes to the school. You didn't want to go at first until he offered you $10 to go and retrieve his notebooks. As anybody would, you accepted the offer, and off you went, very late at nighttime to go into the school and collect all of his notebooks.<br/><br/>Suddenly... You heard the sound of footsteps! You then decide to run to the front door until you realize that you were leaving with 0 notebooks in hand, and 0 notebooks mean $0. So, off you go to find and collect all the notebooks.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nHow to use the controls to play the game\r\n<p>W A S D - Move Forwards, Backwards, Left and Right<br/><br/>Right Click - Interact with Objects (Pick up notebooks, Open doors, ETC)<br/><br/>Left Click - Turn On/Off Flashlight<br/><br/>Left Shift - Sprint (Beware of the stamina)<br/><br/>ESC - Pull up the menu<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nFor everyone who helped make this game\r\n\n<p>Original Game - \u00a0Micah McGonigal (AKA @Basically Games)<br/>Classroom Assets - Styl0o_<br/><br/>Door Assert - dylanheyes<br/><br/>Baldi Model - Baldi_BaldimoreYT<br/><br/>Music -\u00a0@Paradoxx_Productions</p><p>Hacked font -\u00a0David Libeau<br/></p>\n\r\nJust Why Venom?\r\n<p>The reason why I wanted to make this game was out of pure boredom. Not only that but I do want to show how much I have improved over the past few years in Unreal Engine. If you look back on my previous games (The Talking Ben Series) you will tell that I have improved 100x. And I wanted to challenge myself by making a game that I remember looking at back in 2018 and seeing if I can remake it in Unreal Engine.<br/><br/>Now I know a lot of people are going to mistake this for the other game \"Baldi's Unreal Basics\" which yes, are both made in Ue4. But this one is just my version OK!<br/><br/>#fangame #horror #survival #Baldi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T14:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af2/af2b23788e14532b62760b0eb3b86506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Venomous Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
