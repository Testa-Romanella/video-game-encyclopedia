It works out to about an hour or two of game play. Try to  see how fast you can collect gems in each area.</p>\n<p>You can purchase tools using gems you've collected from previous runs. The tools are meant to help you cut down your times.<br/></p>\n<p>It's low polish and clunky by nature and necessity.

Set your expectations accordingly, and enjoy it for what it is!</p>\n<p>------------------------ Current Version: 0.1.6 ----------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Download the zipped file below into a folder, unzip it and run the EXE file.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T13:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/6958b22b5751e7461d34c39faac6e5a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZeroGScott"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
