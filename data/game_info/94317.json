It's almost impossible to not be affected by at least one of these things in day to day life.\u00a0They can make you feel like you've sunk to a depth that there is no easy escape.\u00a0\u00a0What if that pit was a real entity you needed to conquer in order to\u00a0 move on? That is the world of <strong><em>Rock Bottom</em></strong>. Face increasingly more difficult platforming levels to climb to the top, collecting new skills and finding the secrets of the story hidden throughout.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Rock Bottom</em></strong> is Platypus Paradox's second submission to the Northern\u00a0Game Design Challenge.\u00a0This year's theme was crowd sourced by the participants for each different genre teams chose (we picked 2D Platformer prior to the competition). We received \"High Concept Art\" and hit the ground running with it.\u00a0 This year's team was composed of Jean Francois Poulin (lead programmer), Khris Finley (music and sound design), Joel Boucher (level design, programmer) and Paul Ungar (art and animation).</p>\n<p>There are elements that were made for the game that didn't ultimately make it it due to time constraints:\u00a0additional animation (both character and environment), additional art assets,\u00a0improved UI/UX, fine tuned mechanics and controls, additional levels. We are really proud of the project we completed during the competition\u00a0and over the next few months will be working towards a full release with many more levels, puzzles and mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>If you play the game, please leave a comment and a review.
