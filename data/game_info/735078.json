Once you reach the core you must blow it up and kill everyone in the local area, including yourself. This way you will recieve glory in hell as Satan promissed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are simple:</p>\n<p>Moving around: W-S-A-D</p>\n<p>Look around and shoot: Mouse</p>\n<p>Drop weapon: Q (Not recommended unless you are close to other weapon!)</p>\n<p>Pause: Escape Button</p>\n\n<p>Additional Info:</p>\n<p>No matter if you want to beat the level with minimal time or maximum kills you will need to explore the whole level to find ammo and health. Otherwise you might end up without bullets or life.</p>\n<p>Some levels are bigger than others, you can always find the correct path by looking at the signs on the walls or the lamps. If this doesn't help, just listen and look for enemies. If there are more enemies that is the correct path.</p>\n<p>You shoud never drop your weapon, unless you want to complet\u0435 the level unarmed. Once you drop your weapon you can't pick it up unless you restart the level. Why is it made this way ? Well, to be more fun :)</p>\n\n<p>How to install:\r\n</p>\n<p>1.
