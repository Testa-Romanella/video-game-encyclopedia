The goal is to shoot the aliens and collect the coins that they drop. The number of aliens is the number of coins you need to collect to beat the level. Watch out for\u00a0the flying skeletons and Jack-O-Lanterns, but if you shoot them, they drop candy that increases your health when collected. All of the enemies decrease your health if they touch you.\u00a0Press the spacebar to jump. Each level requires more and more coins to beat it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>--\r\n</p>\n<p>My third game for CS3540 - Game Programming class at Northeastern University.
