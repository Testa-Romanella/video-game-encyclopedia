It is inspired by games like Minecraft, Skyrim and Oblivion. Through this project, I have learned how to program game scripts, level design, and user interface design, which was a very good opportunity for me to learn with fun! </p><p>The idea is to create an open-world and allow players to explore and experience the atmosphere of the game. There is no objective and goals in this game, and it is for players to decide what to do in this world.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The world has:<br/></p><ul><li>A lake</li><li>A horse statue</li><li>A house</li><li>A ranch</li><li>A tower</li></ul><p>I also tried my best to find music that match with the\u00a0 in-game world.\u00a0\u00a0So, from the perspective of the main character, explore the beautiful autumn seasoned world during the susnet!\u00a0</p><p>The file you can download is currently set to medium graphic level, which allows users with mid to low spec PCs to play. If you want to play in ultra graphic setting, leave comments, and I will find a way to upload the ultra version.\u00a0</p><p>Since, this is my first project, I really appreciate your comments and feedback. If I see people enjoying this game, I may decide to add more updates.\u00a0 Thank you!</p><p>* After clicking the play button in the main menu, please wait few seconds for the game to load.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-30T01:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afc/afc3b28f6b314f4429ac9fbdff263f20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HageNezz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
