Multiplayer mode redesigned so that at the start of the competition there\u2019s no longer an idle screen or waiting for the other participants to arrive. Now you can show up to race, but can also turn around and try to ram the laggards after crossing the finish line.</p>\n<p>Get away from the police and stay ahead of your rivals. Think fast to ditch to 5-0. Harness the power of the open world to hide, and earn new vehicles to always stay ahead and just get fun of this action.</p>\n<p>P.S. This is just a fan game and a remake of the\u00a0living legend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73d76b361e5d161972ed78d19832c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rodon3000"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
