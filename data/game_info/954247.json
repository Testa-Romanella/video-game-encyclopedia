Coins are randomly generated somewhere inside level, so you have to jump through the level\u00a0to get them.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement controls:\u00a0</strong>arrows left/right, spacebar for jump, left mouse button for menu clicking</p>\n<p>Most of the game assets are done by me, non-designer, who is very proud of my shaky and blurry art, and background is done by Sam.</p>\n<p>Thank you and enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T06:27:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d9017ba462195ed165c10a87b1d6aec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K\u2022A\u2022I"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
