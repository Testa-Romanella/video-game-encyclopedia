You can remove unwanted items (and hence their cards) after a round by paying a fee that increases each time you remove an item.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/857/8578ede5fe46b84c5cc7bb899e802757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Impbox Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
