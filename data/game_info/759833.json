So try to hit as many targets as possible!</strong></p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p> Using the mouse, touch the targets that are on the screen. The more you play, the faster the targets appear and disappear.\u00a0 You only have 6\u00a0  bullets in your magazine.\u00a0 So don't forget to recharge. Click on the lower part of the screen to reload.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong> After a few minutes, 2 targets appear at the same time, then 3!\u00a0 </strong>Try to make the highest score possible!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>If you miss a target, or if it disappears before you have fired, you lose a life . After 5 lives lost, it's game over!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Tip:</strong> </strong>the closer you are to the center, the more points you earn. The center of the target is worth 50 points!\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T13:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6084d944e546744d17ccdbd2d861a49f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["RS Design"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
