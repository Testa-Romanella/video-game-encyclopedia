With your axe you can either run in there and hit everything you touch or plan ahead your moves. Try avoiding hitting trees and colliding with skeletons yourself.</p>\n<p>#2 Nature - You play as Lumberjack who (ironically) wants to defend his woods from party-skeletons who also kinda represents dying nature, or undead to be exact. If you accidentally cut off one of your trees it has a negative effect on you, so be wary of that.</p>\n<p>#3 Inertia - These skeletons, as you also, move with roller-skates (of course)! So every time you move in one direction, you keep moving in that direction until you hit a wall.\u00a0 Thanks to this mechanism some levels are designed to keep you moving!<br/></p>\n<p>#4 Fanfare Music -</p>\n\n<p>(the whole soundtrack is made only using DOOT's and Doot's, sound effects are made with basic bfxr-sounds.)</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>________________________________________________________________________<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>GMS2, Flstudio20, bfxr.</p>\n<p><strong>________________________________________________________________________</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T04:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/54699d78b2498783a935e85b3543c343.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kultisti"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
