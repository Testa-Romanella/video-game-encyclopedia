As in the poem, each man or woman is defined by their ability to change.  In order to change or grow, the player must escape a room that represents a stage in their life.  Early puzzles like one's young life are rather elementary, while later puzzles, growing into adulthood and beyond can become unmanageable.  The Seven Stages is both a game and an emotional experience.  Shakespeare has suggested that a person's ability to change is one of their greatest strengths.  Can you solve the puzzles of your life?<br/><br/>The Seven Stages is a challenging escape the room game that is for hardcore puzzle solvers.  I encourage the player to think of these puzzles with out VR headset on.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a53/a5363249172f0c4dbb28076e408c31fd.jpg", "website": "https://westonbdev.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weston Bell-Geddes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silver Side Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
