In this game you'll play as a giant amoeba, from the genus <em>Chaos</em>. These critters can grow up to 5mm in length, which is mind-blowing! The goal is to survive inside of a lab culture (think: petri dish) for as long as possible. What are you surviving from? <em>Paedocypris progenetica</em><em> </em>- one of the smallest species of fish (10mm in length). How do you survive? By outrunning the <em>progeneticas</em>, and shooting cytoplasm at them. You'll have to keep an eye on your health level though - shooting cytoplasm decreases your health a bit, so make sure to snack on some algae!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>thermokarst: programming, art, game design<br/>johnwatson: audio, game design<br/>d-unit: game design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/081/0816f62c26f2bd25d177b341294fccfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thermokarst", "johnwatson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
