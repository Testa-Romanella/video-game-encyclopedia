{"id": 856929, "slug": "super-mario-63-itch", "name": "Super Mario 63 (itch)", "name_original": "Super Mario 63 (itch)", "description": "<p>Super Mario 63 is a fan-game inspired by Nintendo's Super Mario 64. Many levels and features are based upon it and other of Nintendo's games, but a variety of them are completely original. Among them include a detailed storyline, ability to play as Luigi, a highly customizable Level Designer with sharable codes, three different FLUDD Power-ups, four different power-caps, and 64 Shine Sprites &amp; 64 Star Coins to collect.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the final, complete version of this game. If you have seen this game anywhere else (except on SheezyArt) it probably was taken without permission AND it was the demo version. Only 2 websites have this version of the game.<br/><br/>Also, this game is, for the most part, a remake of the Super Mario Sunshine 64 I made in 2006. After we released the game and came back a few years later, we decided to redo the game with a better engine, more objectives, ect. and this is the product... I kind of went a little overboard, but whatever.<br/><br/>If, while playing, you hear random static noise, we apologize; it is a result of too many sounds being overlapped in flash player therefore overloading some of the less-than-perfect sound cards...<br/><br/>And also, please use the Level Designer. I personally feel that the Level Designer is the best feature.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:08:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73e9742fa3c82ddd1f6e72ae2c20c36f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pougamer1995"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
