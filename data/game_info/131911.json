The end goal of the game was to finally get out of the dream world and find out what her real life is and how she got stuck there. <br/></p>\n<p>Currently I have no plans to continue the project but maybe one day I'll return to it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75cb38917009df5d6f1a1ea9862a4aae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Couch Potato"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
