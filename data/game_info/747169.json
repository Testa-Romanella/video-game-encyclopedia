Each piece MUST be used in order to start the level. When you start the level, the yellow block must get to the end goal before time runs out. The pieces that you can use will vary from being semi-transparent to not transparent. The semi-transparent blocks aren't real and let\u00a0the yellow block go through them, while non-transparent blocks collide with the yellow block. You will encounter different types of blocks later on, but that's for you to figure out. Have fun!</p>\n<p>Allowed\u00a0Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Controller</li><li>WASD - Space</li><li>Arrow Keys - Space</li><li>Mouse</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb2/eb2e1dfe399ca5e501373ba0744954eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZachCreates"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
