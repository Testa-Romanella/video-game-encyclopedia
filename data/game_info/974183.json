It is up to you to expel these extraterrestrial interlopers from your home. Methodical, turn-based strategy meets high-intensity real-time tactical combat as it is up to you defend the world. Against a relentless enemy, combined arms is not optional!<h3>What will you do?</h3><br/><br/>Take the role of the titular character Slush as you defend your home against an inexplicable and relentless enemy. While the aliens may seem to be a superior ground force, they also seem strangely inadequate in other ways... <br/><br/>And when the unexpected happens, it will be up to you to decide the future!<br/><br/><br/>Methodically mop up alien forces across different landscapes, ranging from forests to roads to plains. Your positioning on the turn-based map will determine the parameters of the fights that occur. <br/><br/>Attacked an enemy vehicle without anti-tank weapons? Sounds like your problem\u2026<br/><br/><br/><br/>Is the enemy too powerful? Maybe that airplane can help out with a 500 kg bomb or two, or that rocket artillery can remove the enemy's firing positions.<br/><br/>You made sure to position it close by, right...?<br/><br/><br/><br/>All action occurs on a physics-driven landscape. Projectiles are modeled ballistically, objects are fully destructible, and armor can deflect impacts at oblique angles. <br/><br/>You can either use this to your advantage, or fall victim to it...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fight using weapons ranging from outdated rifles to modern tanks\u2026 or if you can get your hands upon them, captured or reverse-engineered alien equipment. A plasma rifle in the 40 watt range? <br/><br/>With so many options, there is no \"right\" way to play... if it works, it works.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-25T03:40:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc5c2b17898540d0b2fb93b191d05a0c.jpg", "website": "https://slushforce.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triangle Man"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Triangle Man"], "esrb_rating": null}
