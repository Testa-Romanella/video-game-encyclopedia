{"id": 218115, "slug": "word-chaser", "name": "Word Chaser", "name_original": "Word Chaser", "description": "If you like thought provoking Word games, then Squeaky Software has  released a new two player, turn about teaser that really will test your language skills.  However, unlike traditional words-on-a-board games, Word Chaser generates the  words, so that you can 'chase' them around the gameplay area, deleting data as you play and hopefully stopping your opponent from using those words.<br/><br/>You are challenged to reach specific targets every round, such as a certain score or number of Combos (combined words) and if you can reach that target, you get to continue. Scoring is achieved by placing your tiles to extend existing words, creating new words or a combination of both. Fail and the game passes to your opponent who will try to out-do your round score. Succeed and you will continue, but the computer increases your level of difficulty by removing  all used letters from the board and increasing the target to attain. Planning one or more moves ahead will really improve your score because you are in control until the target cannot be reached.<br/><br/>The tile total reduces with each move, the game ending when all the tiles are used by a player.<br/><br/>Multipliers tiles, such as doubles and triples (and even quadruples if you have active Mysteries), pepper the background, changing on each round. Used in conjunction with your tiles, these are key to high scores.<br/><br/>Although not necessary to play Word Chaser, there is an 8th letter available (5 free) which helps boost your opportunities and scores. There is also a Mystery tile available (25 free) which throws random bonuses on to the board. These are very useful in attaining the best scores, and the Mystery is the only way to activate quadruple multipliers.<br/><br/>There is a complete tutorial included and if you make any wrong moves, Word Chaser will let you know as you play. It is very intuitive.<br/><br/>With virtually infinite combinations of boards being produced by Word Chaser, you will never be able to resist another shot at the high score table, which keeps track of your best ever score, and your friends best ever scores. Just who will be the greatest at Word Chaser?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/335/335d8b210dda777e2e1cc20fc8288d2b_7XDuVXJ.jpg", "website": "http://stuf51.wix.com/squeakysoftware", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Squeaky Software"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Stuart Cook"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
