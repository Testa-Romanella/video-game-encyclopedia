Some of their spaceships turn right instead!</p>\n<p>\"SINISTROID\" was originally created as\u00a0a submission to the 2020 GMTK Game Jam. The jam version can be found here!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This newer version includes several UI and environmental improvements, plus a second playable ship class. I intend to keep updating it for a while, I have some more ideas on where to take it.</p>\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Press any key to turn left. Except 1 and 2, which handle ship selection in the menu, and\u00a0Escape - that one quits the game.</p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Music\u00a0\u00a0by RoccoW</li><li>Other sounds generated using sfxr</li><li>PressStart2P font by DaFont</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:04:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59714aa1e30d0d154482cffbd97477c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Inferior Planet"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
