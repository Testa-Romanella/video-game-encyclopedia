It didn't matter if I had significant experience or little experience in 3D games, Dangerous Lanes is a game where I can use my 3D pixel art graphics skills to produce a thrilling and exciting game from scratch. After designing all of the objects, I imported them into Unity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have learned a great deal on C#, I can use it to control my characters and my AI characters. Using artificial intelligence makes Dangerous Lanes more interesting as the characters can use advanced techniques and I had to program animations to dynamically generate content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The items on Dangerous Lanes are chickens, roads, trees, rocks, cars, trucks and a ghost. I wanted Dangerous Lanes to be simple, therefore, the game menus, game over screens and score screen were basic and fundamental.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no music or sound effects as I don't want to get into trouble with Youtube guidelines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall, Dangerous Lanes is a straightforward game for me to produce as all the skills I learned from previous games were applied to use the core foundations of creating a professional video game.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left Mouse Drag Left (Move Left),\u00a0Left Mouse Drag Right (Move Right),\u00a0Left Mouse Drag Up (Move Up),\u00a0Left Mouse Drag Down (Move Down,\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T10:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e787fbad8f31467bbbba173d367ea84f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
