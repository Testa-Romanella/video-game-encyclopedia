Keep climbing or face certain death. Scramble up a treacherous chain of crates, boxes, and blocks to see how high you can reach.

The blocks keep coming, and they only get faster as you ascend!</p>\n<p>The Blocks Cometh comes from Halfbot Studios, the developer behind the hit mobile version of Super Crate Box.
