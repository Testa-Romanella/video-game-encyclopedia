You need CTRL JUICE to steer your ship but you're running low! Get as far as you can and watch out for black holes!</p>\n\n<p>All assets were made in 2 days during the GMTK Game Jam 2020, where the theme was 'out of control'. In our game, control is a physical substance that you can run out of, which means you need to do some interesting maneuvers to survive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:46:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/5050ee41be71ba4517135678c01c30f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChazPotato", "Nascent Space"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
