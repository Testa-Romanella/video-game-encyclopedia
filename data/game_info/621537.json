Congratulations! However, by your family's traditions, you must play a game of Marriage Hockey in order to predict the future of your relationship. Are you doomed, or will you have the best marriage ever? Only the score will tell.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use WASD to control the groom and the arrow keys to control the bride. Use the rope that connects you to hit the puck and score goals. Each goal is a point toward the future of your relationship. We designed this to be played single player, but can easily accommodate a partner playing one of the controls.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, family and friends will throw wedding presents onto the ice to help with your score.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hit Escape to quit.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>SCORE</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Make sure to post your high score in the comments!\u00a0Our personal best was 11.\u00a0 It's kind of a hard game so keep trying and make sure to pop those presents to help you out!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Kenney.nl for tilesheets and sprites<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/\u00a0for sound effects<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:11:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b472a37f1108e11d886bf6b3c7dff731.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["beeskneesgames"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
