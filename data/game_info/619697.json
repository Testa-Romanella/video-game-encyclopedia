I Basically followed his tutorial to the letter. I had high hopes to use his engine as a template to build upon and to actually have it fit the GMTK 2021 Jam theme. However I ran out of time and was only able to build a few levels and unique puzzles. I think the puzzles I designed are fun though so I'm releasing this as a sequel to Vimlark's Game Engine.</p>\n<p>Have Fun and Happy Smacking!!!</p>\n\r\nAssets Used:\r\n<p><strong>Rock Smacker - Vimlark</strong>\u00a0Vimlark - YouTube</p>\n<p><strong>Tiny Adventure Pack - Vryell\u00a0Tiny Adventure Pack by Vryell (itch.io)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Weiholmir - JustFredrik\u00a0https://justfredrik.itch.io/weiholmir</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fx Pixel Art Pack 01 - Hugues Laborde\u00a0https://hugues-laborde.itch.io/fx-pix...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Minimalistic Loops - Goose Ninja\u00a0https://gooseninja.itch.io/minimalist...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>8 Bit Sound Pack - Danereid1024 (Sounds by Dane)\u00a0https://danereid1024.itch.io/8-bit-so...</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/624c9e506be24ca8749aeec785ab20ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gaialove"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
