Lack of resources forces people to fight among each other: lots of pirates, alliances and clans start their struggle for survival. It's just a total anarchy. The part of the captain goes to you: create ships, equip them with crews, build your base, fight and keep doing things as usual.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n- Customization of ships: your ship will depend only on your choice of which modules to collect. You can get either a heavy fighting destroyer or an unarmed cargo ship, or a fast and maneuverable sniper fighter. Everything depends on your imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The crew of the ship could have crucial importance in battle. And the crew itself can be really ragtag in a way that next to the pedantic neat pilot and a dedicated mechanic hero can sit a klepto gunner, a mentally ill tactician and a communicator suffering from Tourette's syndrome. The choice is yours.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- A battle system that depends entirely on which ship you collected, which crew is in action and which actions you made in each turn. During the battle, anything could happen: from unexpected meteorites to a psychic attack from the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Construction and defense of the station. Well, yes. I can't even. Right.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Space pirates, obviously. Only here you can rob pirate stations, and later while returning to your base with loot, you will probably be robbed by other pirates.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Space loaders. You\u2019ll get it.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edc/edcfaf4c771f086c5b9d997b7eddc427.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GD Forge"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["GD Forge"], "esrb_rating": null}
