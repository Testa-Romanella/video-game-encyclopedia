Your instructions manipulate the values of these cells. Your goal is to match the green cell values with the values of the respective red cells above (when they exist).</p>\n<p>The \"run\" button runs your instructions at a speed dictated by the speed meter above.</p>\n<p>The \"step\" button only runs one instruction at a time.</p>\n<p>The \"reset\" button resets the cell tape to its default state.</p>\n<p>You enter your instructions into a green text box. Valid characters are the following:</p>\n<p>&gt; move the pointer one cell to the right<br/>&lt; move the pointer one cell to the left<br/>+ increment the current cell's value (by one)<br/>- decrement the current cell's value (by one)<br/>[ if the current cell's value is 0, jump to the matching ]<br/>] if the current cell's value is not 0, jump to the matching</p>\n\n<p>With just these 6 simple instructions, complexity quickly spirals out of control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:51:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/005bcc73e8799ce8af7f09df312bced2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locally Genius"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
