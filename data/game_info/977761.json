For aeons, the diverse tribes of Boosthaven have been practicing the oldest ritual: racing. Countless drivers devote their lives to complete the ultimate challenge of winning a race for the entertainment of the gods. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Complete 3 laps on the ceremonial track with your life intact to prove your devotion and please the gods testing you from above!<h3> Spend fuel on Awesome Powers to Evade the Challenges Laid out by the Gods </h3> <br/><h3>Create Decks Using Cards From up to 2 Tribes</h3>Choose a God and cherub, and use their unique cards to exert your divine will upon the races below.<h3>Spend Devotion to Play Devious Spells and Traps from your Deck of Tricks</h3><h3>Activate Traps</h3><h3>Show no Mercy as you Destroy the Cars Below!</h3><br/><h3>Gnomes</h3>The gnome tribe is one of the most zealous tribes in the world. Gnome gods build shrines and cast prayers to maximize the devotion they can spend on their particular flavour of chaos.<br/><h3>Lizards</h3>The lizards are a tricky bunch... Drivers racing for these gods need to be on their toes to anticipate surprise traps and wily tricks. An industrious tribe, lizard gods place pressure plates and scouts to automate the activation of their traps. They also have an affinity for generally messing with the drivers, taking away agency through smokescreens and tricks like reversing the cars controls.<br/><h3>Plants</h3>This tribe of sentient plants comprised primarily of mushroom men is terribly misunderstood. One of the most benevolent pantheons in RaceTrap, they devote their energy into cultivation. Gods of this tribe tend to cultivate a fruitful harvest of cards from their deck. Unfortunately, despite their best intentions of beautifying the track, the items they grow tend to harm the drivers more than help.<br/><h3>Insects</h3>The insect tribe is one of the most sinister tribes in the land. Drivers unfortunate enough to race against the insect gods should prepare for a harrowing experience. The gods of this tribe like to play with their food. They tend to pin the cars in place with webs, honey or worst of all, giant overwhelming swarms. <br/><h3>Gain XP to unlock new cards, items and skins</h3><h3>Coming soon...</h3><ul><li> More GameModes (Role Switching each round / multiple drivers / multiple gods etc.)<br/></li><li> Ranked Matchmaking<br/></li><li> Designer VR support<br/></li><li> More Tribes </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T10:46:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/822/8222ec0c454d9bcf075f492aeedb1291.jpg", "website": "https://www.racetrapgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["GnomeFire Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ViewSano"], "esrb_rating": null}
