{"id": 134454, "slug": "come-n-find", "name": "Come n' Find", "name_original": "Come n' Find", "description": "<strong>Come n' Find</strong><p>There's a student at a high school who always seems to be organized and keeps up with everything. Some people would say that he does it too much, but the reason he does it is because his items each hold part of a very evil spirit that'll be released if all are separated for a certain amount of time. One day after leaving school, he realizes that he somehow forgot everything, and now he must go back and find it before the evil spirits within them awakens. Unfortunately, he must avoid the spirits that already exists and roam the school at night looking for someone to kill and take control of that person's body. Can he find the items while avoiding the spirits before time runs out?
