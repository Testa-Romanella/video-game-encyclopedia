Defend sets you up with the role to defend your team with your powerfull, indestructible shield. Ricochet bullets sent flying towards your allies with your shield in order to fight back, but be careful, enemies will get angrier, more dangerous and bigger in numbers.</em></p><p><strong>Game mechanics:</strong></p><p>The game uses the main mechanic of the game Arkanoid,\u00a0as with ricocheting projectiles in order to break your enemies, but expands further on it by giving the player control of the angle of ricochet and a slightly different objective.</p><p><strong>Game objective:</strong></p><p>The game is neverending and you score points from keeping your team alive, at least 2 friends must survive to avoid ending the game. You get points per time survived, and points per enemies defeated, both scaling as the difficulty scales.</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p>As with Arkanoid, you move your element (the shield bearing man) from side to side with the <strong>Left </strong>and <strong>Right </strong>keys. The twist is that\u00a0you can aim your shield with your <strong>mouse movement</strong> in order to ricochet the bullets on the desired direction. Additionally, as heroically as you can be expected to be, you can dash either left or right to save your allies in a last ditch effort, to do this, just press the <strong>respective (Left or Right)\u00a0mouse button</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T15:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/105/10534858e06250fe3debdb5384ad2987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fbodelon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
