You hear a knock on the door and you decide to check it out. This could be the scariest night of your life.</p>\r\nWhoever it is, don't let them in.<br/>You have to survive by 6am.\r\nRemember, even if you think you are safe... You are wrong...\r\nThis game is inspired by Mandela Catalogue videos from Youtube, created by Alex Kister.\r\n\r\nThis game is completely free, but\u00a0if you would like to see more games created by me (not only horror) please consider donating.\r\n<p>If you found any bugs, write in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/258/25831a1d0e7d75cbd3a70582d80ae650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broken Arrow Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
