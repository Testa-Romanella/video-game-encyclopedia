Gathering your things, you head to campus to attend class, and then after sitting through a lengthy lecture, you head back home.<br/><br/>After refueling at a gas station on the way back, you're driving alone in the dark and doing your best to keep yourself awake. Suddenly, you think you see someone in the road, and you violently swerve out of the way to avoid them. Unfortunately, your car gets smashed pretty badly in the wreck, leaving you stranded on a lonely section of highway.<br/><br/>Your cell phone is unable to get any signal, so you decide to hoof it, looking for any sign of civilization or cell phone signal.
