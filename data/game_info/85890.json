Everything about the presentation, to the game itself looks stunning... Vampire Season is a must own iOS title if you want to show off the power of your mighty iPad.\" - Gaming Illustrated<br/><br/>\"Vampire Season is highly entertaining, hilarious and incredibly addictive.\" - Dreadcentral.com<br/><br/>The Great Hunt is on! Dracula's hideout has been revealed and now every big game hunter wants a piece of him. Luckily, Dracula\u2019s Castle Regent once read the first few pages of Sun Tzu's Art of War... and watched Braveheart, like, TEN times.<br/><br/>And who's the Special Assistant to the Castle Regent in Areas of Dracula Defense? Why, YOU, of course! <br/><br/>But, fret not! You\u2019ve got a menagerie of monsters at your disposal to dispatch your attackers -- an army of Zombies, Disco Balls, Boogiemen, Nucular Pumpkins and so much more. (And that\u2019s just the standard arsenal any respectable vampire Count keeps on hand.)<br/><br/>Using your wits, your guts and your army of undead, you must outsmart and out-fight the hunters and keep Dracula safe. He\u2019s counting on you!<br/><br/>30 STORY MODE LEVELS<br/>Make it through all 30 levels of hazardous warfare! Whether it\u2019s forests, swamps, dungeons, laboratories or anything else we can throw at them, your enemies will relentlessly hunt for Dracula's coffin. What kind of people can harbor so much hatred!?<br/><br/>SURVIVAL MODE.<br/>For those seeking a challenge (and some extra cash), things JUST GOT REAL. An infinite amount of enemies will attempt to kill the count. How long can you withstand the onslaught?! Find the strategy that suits you best. Or sucks less.<br/><br/>ACCESSORIZE FOR SUCCESS<br/>Use in-game Weapons to make your monsters more powerful. Give Excalibur to a Ghost! Not only does it increase the damage he does, it makes everyone else\u2019s argument invalid. Seriously, how can a Ghost wield a sword?<br/><br/>WE CAN MAKE YOUR MONSTERS BETTER. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY.<br/>Upgrade monsters as you play! Do you like the Headless Horseman? Make him the envy of the battlefield. Think the Warlock should be the backbone of your army? Turn him into a magic-wielding behemoth. Don't know what a behemoth is? Google it.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO \u201cI\u201d IN COMBINATIONS. THERE ARE *TWO* I'S.<br/>Secret monster and item combinations await you! Like, when you mix the Zombie and the Vampire to create a powerful Zampire! Okay, that one\u2019s not a secret anymore, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. <br/><br/>SPELLS<br/>Thanks to cutting edge wizardry, you will be able to use different spells to boost your army for a short period, making your armies\u2019 jobs that much easier.
