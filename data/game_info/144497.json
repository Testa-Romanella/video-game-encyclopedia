Although it seems to be at the beginning, the actual goal is to remove from the screen all the people that shout at the girl because of her hair. What you do with the girl\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t count for the outcome of the game. With this game, we intend to rise concern about the widespread misconceptions related to women\u2019s hair, and turn upside down the perception of hair as something like \u201cthe more you have, the worse it is\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17e/17e685b5a6a30bd0094d7b9f2fb81648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Naca"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
