The game only has one level and should take only five-to-ten minutes to complete. It was created for my Intermediate Game Development class at Becker college.</p>\n<p>The original assignment was to complete the Unity Roll-a-ball tutorial and to build a basic level around it. I did this pretty easily, and was just intending on turning in this basic level. However, the day before it was due, I\u00a0had the idea of making a Katamari-like game. Because of that, the entirety of the game you see here was completed in a single night.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cf/0cf4086d0410318340b190e7cd9834ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Rogers"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
