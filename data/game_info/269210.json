{"id": 269210, "slug": "lone-troopers", "name": "Lone Troopers", "name_original": "Lone Troopers", "description": "<p><strong><em>Lone Troopers</em></strong> is a fun top down shooter to play over your local network with an unrestricted amount of friends. Set in the WW2 era players can use weapons including the Thompson SMG, M1 Garand, and the M1903 Springfield, as well as throw grenades and use mounted guns such as the MG42.</p>\n<p>With a bleeding out mechanic, wounded players must desperately fight for cover to stem the bleeding by bandaging their wounds.</p>\n<p>Killed players drop their supplies, including their bandages, grenades and spare ammunition clips. Other players can collect these to boost their chance of survival!</p>\n<p>Buildings provide cover for players, with rooves disguising their position, however windows on buildings enable players to look inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Players can prepare and execute surprise ambushes while being concealed in bushes, invisible to all others.\u00a0Be careful, as if you move whilst in a bush, rustling will give your position away.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes in\u00a0<strong><em>Lone Troopers</em></strong>,\u00a0<em>Free For All</em> and\u00a0<em>Team Death Match</em>. In\u00a0<em>FFA</em>, although players can still select\u00a0<em>Axis</em> or\u00a0<em>Allies</em> this only changes their in-game sprite, and they are free to kill anyone. In\u00a0<em>TDM</em> if players kill teammates then they are penalised with a kill taken off their tally. More game modes could be released in the future, and if you have one to recommend then leave a comment or head over to the discord!</p>\n<p>Currently there is one map in\u00a0<strong><em>Lone Troopers</em><em>\u00a0</em></strong>featuring buildings, a bunker, mounted machine guns, penetrable walls, bushes and more! In the future we hope to release a map creation tool as well as other default maps.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0<strong><em>Lone Troopers</em></strong> is currently in an early stage of development there are bugs, if you find one please do not hesitate to contact us. In the event of most bugs, they are fixable by re-spawning (by default escape key).</p>\n<p>You can also save you previous settings such as your last username, gun selected and last address, as well as being able to customise your controls.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong> (default)<strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse to aim and shoot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>R to reload.\u00a0</p>\n<p>E to bandage (if bleeding out).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space to vault.</p>\n<p>F to interact with map (access mounted gun, open/close doors, etc.).\u00a0</p>\n<p>G to throw grenade.</p>\n<p>V to melee.</p>\n<p>Q to view scoreboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Y to use text chat.</p><p>Shift to sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTI</strong><strong>ONS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>To host a server just simply run\u00a0<em>LoneTroopersServer.jar</em>, and take note of the address that appears in the window.
