Challenge your mind and body on this die &amp; retry racing-platformer made by absurdly sadistic people.\u00a0Stay Safe is a die &amp; retry racing-platformer made by absurdly sadistic people to challenge the rest of the world. The controls are so simple that a lemming could play this game, but rumor says that only a god can finish it. Leaderboards and a ridiculous amount of statistics are available for ship measuring contests.\u00a0\u00a0Discover what you are made of and challenge your spirit through three hostile worlds: hit walls at 1000 mph, be crushed by giant blocks, cut in half by spinning blades, compressed by robots. Dare to go further in insanity to face the hidden underside portals.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54c2aec43a7996daba9a90970c900235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plug In Digital"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
