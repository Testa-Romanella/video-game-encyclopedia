{"id": 841666, "slug": "zolga-skyward-sweat", "name": "Zolga - Skyward Sweat", "name_original": "Zolga - Skyward Sweat", "description": "<p><strong><em>THIS IS A CORRECTED VERSION</em></strong></p>\n<p>The\u00a0problem: the game was entirely designed for a placeholder ship, and in the last day of the jam, the final model was replaced. It was 3x heavier (Godot calculates mass from volume) which means the controls were 3x slower, making the game nearly unplayable.</p>\n<p>This version<em><strong> is not the jam version</strong></em>. It is <em>identical </em>except for the 3 corrections below:<br/>- Ship controls adjusted for a 3x heavier ship<br/>- There was a bug softlocking the player if the hover engine is not placed in the bottom, forcing the player to restart the game. Now the ship won't start until you place it right<br/>- It was hard to understand when the checkpoints were saved, the player had to guess and trust. Now there is a small text flashing in the corner to let you know.</p>\n<p><em>Everything else is identical.</em><br/></p><p>The original is at:\u00a0https://madparrot.itch.io/zolga-skyward-sweat-gwj48</p>\n<p><strong><em>---------------------------------</em></strong></p><p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>TIPS:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Land often.</strong>\u00a0Every time you land successfully, a checkpoint is stored. If you die, you go back to your last stable landing. You don't have to leave the ship, just let it stop moving, and that's your new checkpoint. If you think something is going to be difficult, land next to it to have a close checkpoint.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>If landing inside a crater is difficult, you might be able to land outside and cross the border on foot.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>-----------\r\n</p>\n<p>In Zolga and the Didgeridoo of Space, Zolga met Any, and together they found an a recipe\u00a0for bread, left by Any's ancestors in a previous ship.\u00a0In Zolga - Shipwaker, they found the ancestor's abandoned ship, and in it an escape pod (and a supply of carrots). With that, they could escape the doomed planet - in Test Pilot.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the fourth game in the sequence: Zolga and Any have landed on the moon, and they have to fix the escape pod to continue their journey.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game made for Godot Wild Jam 48:\r\n</p>\n<p>Theme: Moon<br/>Wildcards (optional challenges):<br/>\r\n- Include the ability to rest\r\n<br/>\r\n- Don't allow the player to jump\r\n<br/>\r\n- Force the player to return to a previous zone (in this case, return to the ship)\r\n</p>\n<p>Team:\r\nVela: Design, code, art, sfx, plot\r\n<br/>\r\nJohnGabrielUK: Voice, music, writing\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----\r\n</p>\n<p>You are tethered to the ship and can't walk freely:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You have to grab the fallen parts to reinstall in the ship:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You get tired if you move too much outside the ship at once:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Any part can be installed in any place. Finding the right way is up to you. (It does fly the wrong way, just so you know :P )\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Park\u00a0<em>very carefully</em>. Anything touching the ship in the wrong place kills you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>There are 7 parts to be picked, the main engine being the last.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The game will not tell you if you connected a part in the right or wrong place. Good luck with that.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The part will do its job, wherever you place it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Songs used:\r\n</p>\n<p>Incomunicado, Sad Hop, and WonderStories, by Polkavant<br/>Beauty Flow, Casa Bossa Nova, Smooth Lovin, Modern Jazz Samba, by Kevin MacLeod\r\n<br/>\r\n64 Sundays by Twin Musicom\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T11:48:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d84/d8456dc2bd0716b5fb62c57c87363622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mad Parrot Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
