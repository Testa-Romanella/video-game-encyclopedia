What are the resulting dishes?</p><p>I don't know about you, but I'm hungry.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Serious stuff:</p><p>This was made in a graduate class based on Pippin Barr's 2016 IndieCade East talk, \"36 Reasons to Make the Same Game 36 Times.\"</p><p><em>10 Flights</em> works on PC and Mac OSX.  You can use a keyboard, a DualShock 4 controller, or whatever Xbox controller you have (tested with Xbox One and Xbox 360).  There's a readme in there with more info, but I strongly suggest you just boot up the game and play and have a good time.</p><p>The credits are in the secret game.  Try to unlock them and see all the people I thanked!</p><p>Update 5-1-2017</p><p>I fixed some typos in the credits and also made sure the Mac build is correct.  Balloon Light should play correctly now, and a couple of other minor issues that nobody will ever notice were also fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad69573e8c051a3bfc53fcf3e069fca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eric Guadara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
