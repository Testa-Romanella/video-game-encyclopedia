I had insufficient time due to the large scope of the game. The primary gameplay loop (mining) is finished. However, the secondary gameplay loop (crafting and building) is not. My estimate is that it will take a further 100 hours to finish the game.<br/></p>\n<p>The ambient music was made by\u00a0Marching Dream.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 70 hours</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:48:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298166475c78c086de015c58d40838aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
