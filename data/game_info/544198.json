It is a simple Snake variant.<br/></p>\n<p>You are a nomad traveling through the desert and make a living by selling carpets. As you build your wealth, others will seek to join your caravan.</p>\n<p>Move with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Remember to drink (by collecting water), or you will die of thirst!<br/>Pick up carpets to get coins (score). The higher your score, the faster you move and the more water you will need.<br/><br/>---<br/>This is my first game made with Godot. I had to sack my previous idea midway through because it was unrealistic :D I know the result is very poor but I did manage to learn a bunch of things I had set out to learn about :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T03:13:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e900d50ad62bf851a69f15fadcba06d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhindieGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
