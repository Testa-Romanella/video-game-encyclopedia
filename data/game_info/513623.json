Use WASD to roll around, and space to jump.</p>\n<p>You will find yourself in a dark and moodily lit forest area that has been converted into some sort of pumpkin patch. Complete the somewhat tedious challenges to finish the mini-game, or just roll around until you get bored.</p>\n<p>A shadow will appear and wander the area. If it catches you, you will lose all your progress. If you take too long, more shadows will appear.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the file size, it is definitely not proportional to the amount of gameplay provided.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T04:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c61a50686e39c1212da3ed83b0934d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["theTerrificJD"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
