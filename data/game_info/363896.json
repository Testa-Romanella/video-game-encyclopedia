That is, it's a set of variations on an original game: in this case it's chess. There are eight variations in the collection (one for each rank on a chessboard or something), each exploring some addition to or subtraction from the original game of chess, whether it's playing with gravity applied or playing quantum moves that exercise every option at once. Unsurprisingly you can't really play any of these variations as you would play standard chess, but that's kind of the fun of it - a chance to play some chess without freaking out about the obscene difficulty it represents.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-02T20:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d93069578ad7253ceed3add94121f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pippinbarr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
