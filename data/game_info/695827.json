{"id": 695827, "slug": "tomb-of-the-lost-sentry", "name": "Tomb of The Lost Sentry", "name_original": "Tomb of The Lost Sentry", "description": "An ancient building put together for an unknown purpose, the stronghold of The Fellowship of The Blind Watchers features everything a cult could want: non-Euclidian architecture, deadly traps, a large wall surrounding it, and even a great view of the forest it's hidden in. But beware, the cultists aren't the only inhabitants. The reanimated remains of fallen cultists roam the halls, attacking any living thing they see. These monsters are called sentrymen, and only move to add the living to their ranks. Of course, The Fellowship simply brushes them under the rug and ignores the threat of their ever increasing numbers.<br/><br/>A nameless cultist has a strange dream one night, and wakes up to see through the cult's lies. Spotting the mounting danger of the ever multiplying sentrymen, the soon ex-cultist resolves to find a way out before they become the stronghold's next victim.<br/><br/>Solve puzzles, dodge deadly traps, do favors for other cultists, and face the Higher Ups, all to open the next door. If the hordes of sentrymen don\u2019t kill you, the hundreds of deadly traps built into the walls just might. As long as you keep an eye on your surroundings, you may make it out alive.<br/><br/>Can you unravel the mysterious origin of the sentrymen, and escape the stronghold with your life?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T03:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d97dda83bde821a077db0337d58a66a5.jpg", "website": "https://spleengames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spleen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["spleen"], "esrb_rating": null}
