Deyse, already knowing our nature as the Timegod's thugs Nya, alerts the Witch to back off Nya. But my speech about a great power inside the rift Nya makes Pinus throw herself inside it without a second thought Nya.<br/>What she wasn't expecting was becoming trapped to movements timed by me Nya hahaha!<br/>Will she find the way out Nya? It doesn't matter Nya! I can stay here having fun for millenia while she dances to the rhythm of my paradox Nyammmm!</p>\n<p>Only one finger Nya! Only one movement each beat Nya! Think slowly Nya, think fast Nya! Think nyaaaammmm!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T13:54:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f22/f22ebe1f1aab9e45882cbeeb0c39c5a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u00e1ka\u00f1a"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
