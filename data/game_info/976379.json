This game goes beyond just entertainment and invites players to explore important ethical issues surrounding giant tech corporations and the usage of personal data by companies and governments.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThrough VERUM's gameplay, you will embark on a journey to understand the story behind the game. As you progress, you will encounter multiple side stories that cover different aspects of the main plot and present different perspectives. By seeing the same plot through these different lenses, you will gain a more diverse understanding of the topics presented.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach side story consists of a series of scenes followed by unique endings, providing valuable information for players to understand the main plot. The best part? The player can visualize these endings in any order without respecting their chronological timeline.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the player traverses through unique scenes related to side stories, they will unlock one of VERUM's multiple endings. The game always starts (restarts) at the same initial scene, and the player can jump between side stories to reach different endings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVERUM's gameplay is simple yet immersive. Players must find a gate to move from one scene to another, and interaction with these gates is as simple as a click or click and hold. The narrative of each scene gives a clue to what that specific scene represents and indicates what can be a gate there.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith its beautiful and captivating graphics, VERUM is an experience like no other. It challenges players to question their own beliefs and to look at the same topic from different perspectives. There are no right or wrong answers, only valuable insights that will leave you thinking long after the game is over.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAre you ready to challenge your beliefs and explore the world of VERUM? Get ready to dive into this thought-provoking experience and unlock multiple endings to uncover the full story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T04:16:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d9eb750ab7ee1c009edc9e54446dfad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gilp Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gilp Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
