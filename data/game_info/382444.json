So, can't say I was shocked when one day it vanished without a trace. It clearly had enough.</p>\n<p>Can't just sit amidst the void, though, twiddling our thumbs-to-be. We'll be starting from scratch, you and I. No experience in universe-forging? Not to worry. Just sit tight and enjoy the ride; <strong>5 minutes or so</strong>, and we'll be where we need to be.</p>\n<p>But before we begin, a bit of advice. If all this were happening on a screen, I'd suggest utilizing its surface to its fullest instead of being content with a mere window. Moreover, if music and sounds still existed, I'd strongly consider not disregarding them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Last but not least, if those fancy mobile devices were still around (I sure miss mine!), I wouldn't discourage you from using them.
