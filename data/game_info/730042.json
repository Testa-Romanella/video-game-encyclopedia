During its dormant state, Glint is granted a brief respite, during which they can place platforms made of light and shadow. Their placement is key to surviving the onslaught that will come during the void's active state.\r\n </p>\n<p>During its active state, the void will drain all the light in the world and concentrate it on itself, hiding some platforms, while leaving others visible. Glint has to survive this state by remembering the position of the hidden platforms to dodge attacks and defeat enemies that are being sent by the void to deplete their Inner Light.\r\n </p>\n<p>Being the last glint of light that is fighting for their world, once Glint's Inner Light is depleted, the void will succeed in its endeavor.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T06:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/641b5dd809b6b86f9f41820ca4d74530.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sarah", "Julio Pagani Filho", "BrunoLimenzo", "Andre Traverso"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
