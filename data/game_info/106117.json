Collaborated with my friend Jonny to create a quick and cute platform bombing game. <br/></p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY: <br/></strong></p><p>Move around your character using WASD.<br/>Click the bottom buttons to select an item. Click on a tile (or empty space) to use the ability. Each ability has a cool down. Your goal on each level is to clear the screen of all present enemies, you can find how many are left in the top right corner. <br/></p><p>You lose a life if your health reaches 0 or if you fall to a pit. Some enemies and some of your attacks can take the ground off from beneath you so be careful and have fun!</p><p><strong>You can rate this game for the LDJAM here:</strong> https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/bomber-wonder<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f342e37c4ce5c5846e64a90ba72862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JesusAcHe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
