It especially requires a good memory to remember all the recipes! <br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Play with the mouse!</p>\n<p><strong>To play:</strong><br/>1. Click the recipes book to find all the recipes \u00a0<br/>2. Drag all the ingredients to the cooking pot \u00a0<br/>3. Click to stir the cooking pot \u00a0<br/>4.
