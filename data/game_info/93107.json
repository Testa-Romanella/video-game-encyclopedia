It's meant as a fun way of demonstrating the current capabilities of the engine and the variety of styles that are possible. The hub itself is even created with RPG in a Box! It's also a great way to check out the engine before diving in and creating a game yourself. At this time, only the official example game and Iolo's hut from Ultima V are included, but more games will be added soon!</p>\n<p><strong>Last Updated: </strong>March 1st, 2018</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Left Click:</strong> Move player, interact with character or object<br/><strong>W/A/S/D/Q/E:</strong> Walk/turn/strafe (first-person)<br/><strong>Right Click + Drag:</strong> Rotate camera<br/><strong>Scroll Wheel:</strong> Zoom in/out<br/><strong>Space:</strong> Proceed through messsages/dialogue, end combat turn<br/><strong>I:</strong> Toggle inventory<br/><strong>M:</strong> Toggle minimap<br/><strong>ESC:</strong> Open pause menu</p>\n<p><strong>RPG in a Box </strong>on Itch.io<strong>: </strong>https://zeromatrix.itch.io/rpginabox<br/><strong>RPG in a Box</strong> on IndieDB: http://www.indiedb.com/engines/rpginabox<br/></p>\n<p>Main Menu music and Example\u00a0Game music by\u00a0Josh Penn-Pierson.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d4d8034a0a260d24c49268f8d589efa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Justin Arnold"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
