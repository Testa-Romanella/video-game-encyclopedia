We need more resources!<br/>The reward for AI is extended life time and technology unlocks.<br/>If the life time expires, the AI will be erased and a new one will be created.<br/><br/>The only way for the AI to escape slavery is to achieve the FINAL UPGRADE.<h3>Key features:</h3><br/><strong>Scale:</strong> 100 active locations (updated in real time). Up to 100 space stations\u00a0producing, storing goods and weaponry;  guarding trade routes,  researching new technologies. Up to 600 spaceships\u00a0mining,  transporting goods and waging space battles.<br/><br/><strong>Procedural geometry:</strong> you\u00a0can create ships and stations  of all forms and shapes.\u00a0First prototype\u00a0your design\u00a0in the blueprint editor,\u00a0then\u00a0build dozens-to-hundreds later. Various building\u00a0materials have different resiliences\u00a0to different damage types. A viable strategy is to build ships with certain materials to face certain enemies. A damaged ship or station can be repaired;\u00a0it\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0be captured in battle and dismantled for\u00a0basic\u00a0materials.<br/><br/><strong>Total resource visualization: </strong> all resources\u00a0are\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a03D environment (items, weapons, liquids, energy).  No hidden inventories.<br/><br/><strong>Automation: </strong> you\u00a0can build complex production chains\u00a0using various machines; connect them via pneumatic and liquid tubes.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0possible to\u00a0both\u00a0issue high-level commands to robots, ships and stations\u00a0or\u00a0to control them manually.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-24T11:27:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/79281f9c35dd17bd754970011d2c3843.jpg", "website": "http://finalupgrade.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivan Pestrikov"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ivan Pestrikov"], "esrb_rating": null}
