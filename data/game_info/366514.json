But in hex because I couldn't fit '2048' in 1/16 of 64x64. Also I'm not certain the behaviour is quite the same as at 2048.org but I like the way this algorithm plays and that the code for it is\u00a0super short. I set myself the challenge of using no image sprites, only text labels and drawn lines. First experience with dragonruby-gtk and itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/880d879c1ad6fe980f4cf569302b1b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["calicoday"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
