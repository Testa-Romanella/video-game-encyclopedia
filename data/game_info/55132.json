Each character represents a certain country and has his or her own reasons for wanting to win against the others.</p>\n<p>Each character has his or her own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depends on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still).
