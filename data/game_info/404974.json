No two levels are the same, no two game sessions are the same. As you progress through the levels you get to collect items for your inventory : weapons, shields, and dozens of other type items. Each item in your inventory is\u00a0<strong>a card in your deck</strong>.<br/><br/>Don't want certain cards? don't pick them up! That's how you build your deck in this game: as you go.<br/><br/>When you encounter aliens, you will engage with them in a card-battle: Either you or the alien will choose the first card, depending on who attacks who. And then the other picks his card. Defeat the alien, and move on to the next! Card battles are\u00a0<strong>swift</strong>, and to the point.<br/><br/>The game will randomly generate\u00a0<strong>events</strong>,\u00a0<strong>alternate routes</strong>\u00a0and decide what effects\u00a0<strong>plant-spores</strong>\u00a0have on you or the aliens. Like I said: no two games will be the same!<br/></p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li><em>Endless variation</em>\u00a0- Every game plays like a unique mission for your away-team - the layout is different every time. From the level layouts, to special events, and alternate paths. Every game will be unique.</li><li><em>Unique card/inventory system</em>\u00a0- Your inventory is your deck of cards, every weapon, shield, or item you pick up is a card you use in battles and sits in your inventory (your deck).</li><li><em>Unlockable extras</em>\u00a0- Complete challenges to unlock special Trinkets to help you in your games. Complete multiply missions to permanently unlock Buff cards, and increase your experience level to unlock special passive cards.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T04:02:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/89370bbcb9b901680830c0bc5eda5e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Orangepixel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
