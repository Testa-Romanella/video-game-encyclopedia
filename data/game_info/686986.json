You will be transported to the room on the other side of the mirror portal, whose wall colours are indicated by the portal\u2019s border. In addition, your orientation within the virtual environment will be altered by 180 degrees along the Y axis, which enables you to walk across your play area in the opposite direction and fully traverse each room.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In order to pick up a Block, hover your Oculus controller on it such that its colour turns bright yellow. Press and hold the corresponding <strong>Hand Trigger</strong> button to pick up the Block and hold it in your hand. Release the Hand Trigger if you want to drop or throw the Block.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are four platforms in each of the nine rooms; when the game begins, each platform will contain one of nine potential Block types. The objective of the game is to match each Block with its corresponding room by colour. There are four Blocks of each colour, so simply place one on an empty platform in the correct room to add a point to your score, and return all 36 to their proper rooms to complete the game!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ensure that your play area is 6 feet by 6 feet at minimum, and note that this game will <strong>only work on an Oculus Quest or Quest 2!</strong>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>For more on the concept of portalling, contact me at sauer24j@uregina.ca or Squire#7745 on Discord.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T03:22:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14fca2242ff3700f3f10a189431f7955.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["SquareSquire"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
