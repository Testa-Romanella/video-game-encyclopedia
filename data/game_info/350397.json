{"id": 350397, "slug": "sandwich-sudoku", "name": "Sandwich Sudoku", "name_original": "Sandwich Sudoku", "description": "<p>Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube&#39;s most popular Sudoku channel, here is the brand new &quot;Sandwich Sudoku&quot; game that has become an internet sensation!<br />\nIn Sandwich Sudoku, the puzzle is presented with extra numbers outside the grid next to each row and column.  These numbers indicate the SUM of cells sandwiched between the 1 and the 9 in that row/column.  The logic required to solve the puzzles will appeal to anyone who enjoys normal sudoku and a bit of basic maths.  Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic.  They&#39;ve even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck.  Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship.<br />\n&quot;I love it!&quot; says Alex Bellos, author of Alex&#39;s Adventures in Numberland.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T12:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ec74a8ac2a99a66f649f7ced056119d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 41, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Studio Goya", "Nick Carney"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Studio Goya", "Nick Carney"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
