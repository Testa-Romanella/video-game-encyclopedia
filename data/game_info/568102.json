His failure was thinking he could fly to the heavens and take a seat next to the gods. You will have to fail in the same way he did to complete this game. The pieces of your melting wings will be the key to your progress and the means to your fall. Ego leads to the death of great men!</p>\r\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Movement: AD or Right and Left Arrows<br/>Glide: W or Up Arrow<br/>Fly:\u00a0Space / Ctrl or Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>You can fly as long as you have\u00a0wax left in your wings. Your wings will melt faster as you go closer to the sun.\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can <strong>drop wax</strong> on <strong>weight plates</strong> to active them, you will have to use enough to trigger them</li>\n<li>You can break bridges if you fall hard enough onto them, but be careful if you fall to hard into unbreakable ground you die.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\n\r\nGuide\r\n<p>I ran out of time so the level design leaves a lot to be desired. Here are the key point to pass the level.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will start dropping wax at the level of the first platform. Every 1 second depending on your height the wings take heat damage. The higher you go the more damage they take per tick. This is why you will drop two at higher levels</li>\n<li>You have to drop 3 wax pieces on the first plate to activate it to get access to second weight plate</li>\n<li>You have to drop 1 wax piece on second plate to activate it. This moves the shroom barrier keeping you from reaching the top. You can reclaim the 3 wax on the original plate after activating the 2nd plate.</li>\n<li>You have to race to the top and then break through the bridge to win the level. You will not be able to keep all your wax.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I ran out of time so there is unfortunately no sound in the game. There is only one level. I used the following assets:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 5 Worlds Asset Pack:\u00a0by Moon Tribe</li>\n<li>The Angel Pack - by Toy Master (I had to create the walk, run, and idle but they provided the flying animation and the inspiration for the character look)</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d24344f6a3bb8930dd5c804eaa9ec4d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mbalrog6"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
