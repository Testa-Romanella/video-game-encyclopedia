The games is so rushed because I needed to get it out before the Toddy meme died...</p>\n<p>The objective of this game is to kill Kazak (spelled wrong to avoid being copystriked).<br/>But for Kazak to spawn you need to collect 10000 points!<br/>You collect points by killing enemies, buying upgrades and destroying castles.<br/>Every time you destroy a caste, two new will spawn at random locations on the map.<br/>When you pass a set amount of point, bigger/higer level castles will spawn.<br/>This happens when the \u201cTime till next event\u201d timer gets to 0.<br/>Follow the arrows to find castles.</p>\n<p>Whenever you kill an enemy or a castle, they will drop gold.<br/>This gold can be used to buy upgrades from the market.<br/>The blue arrow always points towards the market making it easy to find.<br/>I recommend players to buy DMG(damage) first!</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I (Squidishhead) is not affiliated with The Yogscast in any way!
