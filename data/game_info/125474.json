The theme was \"Growing\"</p><p>The player grows exponentially as he eats, in an ever-growing hostile environment.</p><p>Eat the tasty looking balls, while avoiding contact with traps, missiles ... and LASER BEAMS !</p><p>TWO DIFFERENT MODES:<br/>- Classic (which is good for starting)<br/>- GoFast (which is more nervous and challenging)</p><p><strong>LOCAL MULTIPLAYER:</strong><br/>The game can be played with a friend in local mode. Cooperate with him, or push him into traps, your choice !</p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>Player one - arrows key<br/>Player two - WASD (or QWSD for our friendly azerty keyboard users).</p><p><strong>TIPS:<br/></strong>Don't be afraid of traps much smaller than you ;)</p><p><strong>FIXES:</strong><br/>-Joystick controller enabled<br/>-Balanced ennemies so they start spawning later in the game rather than right at the start.<br/>-Fixed a little camera issue when playing in \"Go fast\" mode.</p><p>Have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32db3867de1bc3917be5fe17e4a90f3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["crucknuk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
