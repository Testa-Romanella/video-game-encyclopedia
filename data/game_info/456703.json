Old friends turn to mindless enemies. Memorable scenes turn to unrecognizable landscapes. Can this godlike entity be\u00a0defeated or will everything slowly corrupt in the belly of the World Eater?<br/></p>\n<p>This is a demo of a metroidvania style game concept submitted for the Metroidvania Month 8. The game would have the player travel through\u00a0different worlds that have been consumed by the Eater of Worlds as he tries to find a way to save what he can and hopefully defeat the World Eater, if a God can be defeated at all.<br/></p>\n\n<p>KEYBOARD/MOUSE:<br/>W,A,S,D / Arrows: Movement<br/>SPACE: Jump<br/>LEFT Mouse / J: Attack<br/>L SHIFT / K: Dash<br/>SPACE + LEFT MOUSE: Jump Attack<br/><br/>CONTROLLER (XInput):<br/>L STICK / D-PAD: Movement<br/>A: Jump<br/>X: Attack<br/>L/R TRIGGER: Dash<br/>JUMP + ATTACK: Jump Attack<br/></p>\n<p>AKFULA | Programmer<br/>\u00a0AKSEN | Sound Designer<br/>BABA YAGA | Game Artist<br/>BERT COLE\u00a0| Composer<br/>DANTONSLIP | Game Artist<br/>UNCEWUB | Programmer<br/></p>\n<p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T06:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05d5e60eefa57ea868a820f277cb832.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DantonSlip", "Aksen", "Akfula", "Baba Yaga", "UnceWub", "Bit By Bit Bert"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
