They trust in you, they believe in you, they know you will guide them to a brighter future.</p>\n<p>Shortly this game is a battle clicker game. You always have a choice to buy miners or defenders with your mined gold.</p>\n<p>Bug Machine is the first game that wasnt made entirely by me, i would like to thank\u00a0 <strong>AikdoTom</strong>, <strong>Lukyl.n</strong> and <strong>Alt+ego</strong> for the amazing art.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72dfb7dd954f6237bb59245df5ee08f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
