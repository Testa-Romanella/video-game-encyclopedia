Buy a gun, kill some monsters, hoard some  ears, swap them for better body parts. Investing in weapons is good  because you can always pick them up again. Or you can just drop them in  town if you\u2019re scared. Once you have a tonne of arms and legs you can go  west and storm the base and kill motherdrain.\r\n</p>\n<p>== What\u2019s a Rude Bear? ==\r\n</p>\n<p>This  is the 18th Rude Bear game in the RB core series, the 20th Ludum Dare  extended universe Rude Bear game, and the 20th extended universe Rude  Bear game.
