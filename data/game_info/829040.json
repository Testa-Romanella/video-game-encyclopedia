All the images in the game are hand made by me(and my computer) so there's only gonna be only a few more days then the current day at best</p>\n<p>The game is made to fit specifically my needs and so I didn't make much room for customization. My choice of words can also seem random and that's because it somewhat is...</p>\n<p>Although there is a preference\u00a0 to put words that I know their meanings but just not the kanji as late as possible, so one day it'll change from like \"curriculum\" or some other \"difficult word\" to \"blue\"</p>\n\n<strong>If no words appear:</strong>\n<p>If you try to study or test yourself and no words appear that probably means you haven't downloaded the game version that has the words for this day. Since I'm gonna(try to) constantly add more and more days(I'm not gonna start of with the full 1000 or whatever), I'll add a devlog to this project as well so you'll know how many days the project has. At the time of release - the game has 6 days worth of words(by the time you're reading it may be more - so check the devlog.</p>\n<p>There's also an option to define the first day yourself in-game so that you can progress using the normal \"study\" and \"test yourself\" windows without any real need of the \"by number\" window</p>\n\n<strong>If you'd like to support me while I'm looking for a job</strong>:\r\n<p>You could either donate when you download, or watch ads in\u00a0 the app. I wanted the app to be learning focused as much as possible,\u00a0so ads aren't a part of the actual \"gameplay\". However there is a page for ads with a button that plays an ad for you. Sometimes it'll take a bit waiting and a few presses for the first ad but then it'll be smooth.</p>\n<p>Any support is greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T07:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/863c630eeba69eecdd7e3a3c8e0fd946.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["ALONUCLEAR"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
