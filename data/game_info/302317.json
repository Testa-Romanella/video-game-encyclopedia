Unlimited position In this game, the movement of graphics is not limited by the unit lattice.<br/><strong> Graphics can be moved to arbitrary coordinates rather than integer units. </strong><br/><strong> The rotation of the graphic can also be an arbitrary angle .</strong> Deadly cutting When the graphic meets the following conditions, the graphic is cut into multiple pieces.<br/><strong> The countdown on the graph is zero. </strong><br/><strong> When the filling of a graphic in a layer meets the requirements. </strong><br/> this means that as the game progresses, once you have an oblique graphic, there will be a lot of irregular objects in the game (whether this is a blessing or a curse \uff1b\uff09)  Difficulty rating For single-player mode, I offer three different types of difficulty.<br/><strong> simple </strong> when the layer fill reaches 75% can score elimination.<br/><strong> normal </strong> when the layer fill reaches 85% can score elimination.<br/><strong> difficulty </strong> when the layer fill reaches 90%, the score is eliminated.<br/> at the moment I test that the simple pattern seems too simple, and the subsequent difficulty will be adjusted according to the feedback.  scoring rules Unlike the traditional score, I designed a new set of scoring rules.<br/><strong> A row of padding *1000 gets the score of the conversion elimination. </strong><br/><strong> Continuous elimination of two lines will be two lines of the total score of *2.</strong><br/><strong> continuous elimination of three rows will be three lines of total *3 and so on. </strong> Development plan If the current version feedback is good, then I will continue to complete the game's two or two modes.<br/> Cooperation mode  will be co-operation between the two people to complete a game, may be set to be  one person to manipulate the movement of another person responsible for rotation. <br/> Battle mode  Two people have different areas and can harass your opponent by consuming points to use props .<br/>Both modes have online and local split screens to choose from<br/><br/>If you have some good advise or anything other you can write review below or send email to me  (please use \u201cTimeFall\u201d as title)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a3559727e04387ef58852626e7e9cfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Unlimited_Deer_"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unlimited_Deer_"], "esrb_rating": null}
