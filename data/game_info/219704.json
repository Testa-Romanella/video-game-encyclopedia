Typically, a game will also include a 'tableau' of piles used to organize the cards before they are played on to the foundations. In a few games, the goal is to discard pairs of cards according to a particular rule.<br/><br/>To see specific details of the rules and aim of a given game, on-screen instructions are provided: simply press the '?' button to the right of the screen. In most games, you can also press the 'Hint' (light bulb) button to get a turn suggestion at any point during play.<br/><br/>Redeals<br/><br/>Some games allow 'redeals'. If available, the redeal icon in the top right of the screen will be available. Depending on the game, a redeal will typically of re-shuffling and re-dealing the 'stock' of cards, or dealing extra cards on to the tableau. Please consult the rules for the individual game in question for more details of the availability and function of redeals.<br/><br/>Support &amp; Feedback<br/><br/>For further information about Solitaire Whizz, or to report a potential problem, please got to http://www.solitairewhizz.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:48:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0bf62dd48b54233d97346b59128b31.jpg", "website": "http://www.solitairewhizz.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Neil Coffey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Neil Coffey"], "esrb_rating": null}
