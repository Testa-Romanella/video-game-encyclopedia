That's the amount of time i gave myself.</p>\n<p>Originally Magic Mines was going to be a text adventure... then i remembered the requirement. So... i got to work on a\u00a0Non-Euclidean\u00a0\u00a0action RPG.</p>\n<p>12 hours in and i needed a snack break (idk why i put this in.)</p>\n<p>24 hours later i tested it (yes i was timing myself XD) and it actually felt pretty good.</p>\n<p>36 hours and i had the full prototype done! (I still had work to do tho :p)</p>\n<p>48 hours later and all things where done. There are still little glitches and bugs that i wanted to fix but a timers a timer.</p>\r\nThanks for playing!\r\nComment for a chapter two!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df083b26c650018590512edbea1dea31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["steepcrane"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
