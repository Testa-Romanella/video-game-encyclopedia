This is the origin of the phrase in the first place, so bringing it back to the near-origin of gaming with Intellivision-style graphics seems fitting. Reach the end before losing all your lives and you've successfully \"run the gauntlet\"!<br/><br/>Inspired by and made for both the Intellivision Jam and the Uniquely Similar Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/194/19430e3aed3453bc00f4a2d55465ec24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FricativeMelon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
