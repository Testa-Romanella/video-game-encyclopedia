My idea for the topic was to take the death sequence from super mario and make it the core game mechanic.<br/>No more rage quitting\u00a0when falling off the edge down\u00a0into the abyss\u00a0<em>(which I have totally never ever\u00a0done, not even once... ^^\u00a0)</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also it's a bit meta but I had to fail to progress with making this game. I implemented the movement a bit sloppy and had a bug where the player could jump repeatedly if it collided\u00a0with any collider marked as ground, which ended up as a special wall climb feature :)</p>\n<p><strong>This game uses these sounds from freesound:</strong><br/>Background music: \"Alone\" by Migfus20 ( https://freesound.org/people/Migfus20/sounds/559856/ ) licensed under CC BY 3.0<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>If you want to see a gameplay of the game:</strong></p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:56:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e2/4e254443ba3a4bf7c8bd63d79ac39a40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Arget4me"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
