{"id": 897377, "slug": "will-o-wisp-2", "name": "Will-O-Wisp", "name_original": "Will-O-Wisp", "description": "<p><em><strong>Will-O-Wisp</strong> is a \"precision\" 2D platformer made for 2-Button Game jam 2022. This game runs entirely on 2 control buttons - W and D.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please don't play it in fullscreen. This game doesn't have a fullscreen support, unfortunately (forgot to add it. I'll be doing that after the Jam event ends).<br/><br/>Concept:</strong><br/><br/>You play as the manifestation of your mind. Keep motivating it to move forward and <strong>pursue</strong> the manifestation of will power - the wisp. <br/>If the mind is not pushed forward, the negativity and clouded thoughts will hinder and pull the mind back.<br/>Learning to accept and control the negativity will help you guide the mind in the right direction.<br/>The mind can use sources of motivation to drive it faster - it could come from self-motivation (jump dashes) or from inspiration (glowing orbs are the manifestation of inspirations).</p>\n<p>Make your way through the world of thoughts to find the wisps of will - the<strong> Will-O-Wisps</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Controls:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Press and hold D:</strong> Push the mind forward.<br/><strong>Release D:</strong> Mind will be pulled back.<br/><strong>Press and hold W:</strong> Jump to overcome obstacles.<br/><strong>Release W while in air:</strong> Dash forward using self-motivation.<br/>Nothing happens when you release W while grounded.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashes have cooldown. Mind won't be able to dash when it's yellow in appearance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dashes will lock you in the direction in which you are moving. You'll have to tap D or hold D until the dash ends\u00a0to regain control.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Notes from Dev:</strong><br/>This game could be glitchy as it was made in 3 days in a tight schedule. Hope you have fun playing it. Any feedback is appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong></p>\n<p>Ashish\u00a0Varghese\u00a0George - BGM ( Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/@avg612)</p>\n<p>Azreal - Playtesting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T10:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55ee95f742813a910f86bf3167602ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nitheesh Pillai"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
