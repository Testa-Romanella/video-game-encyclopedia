{"id": 616172, "slug": "aurora-2", "name": "Aur[Or]A", "name_original": "Aur[Or]A", "description": "Aur[Or]A depicts the aura and emotional essence of the human voice through sound vibrations. The viewer has the opportunity to see the frequencies of the sound produced by their voice and the structure it generates. The viewer has the opportunity to play freely and interact with the sound. Each timbre of the voice is attached to a color tone, but the voice creates sculptures of reverberation, depicting the result in a way that is easily understood by the viewer. Each of the voice tones is assigned important keywords and descriptions to help the viewer navigate. The result is the expression of the qualities of energy that each person possesses and manifests individually through the voice. Referring to cases where the waveform has strong fluctuations, it can be interpreted as a \"strong\" vocal aura. The waveform is essentially expressed during the operation of a word structure or mental state, but they are usually related as long as it is the same person speaking.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b82d16f1fc168d370aacd50188d82c27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["keitac"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
