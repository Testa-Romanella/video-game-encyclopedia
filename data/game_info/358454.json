{"id": 358454, "slug": "summer-knights", "name": "Summer Knights", "name_original": "Summer Knights", "description": "Summer Knights is an RPG Maker game about a simpler time. A time of tag, water balloons, and coming in when the streetlights come on. It's about childhood... and how awful it was. This comedy makes fun of childhood nostalgia by forcing you to remember what it's really like to deal with eight year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour choices in this game determine how you experience this. Make fun of the childish antics, and you'll see the world as it is. But if you play along, you'll see the world as it isn't. Will you fight sticks or orcs? Will you sail the sea or will you cross the street? Regardless, the annoyance of childhood will shine through, but perhaps an honest glimmer of what we loved about it as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game's music was composed by PengoSolvent. Get the soundtrack on bandcamp now.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T03:01:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da9/da959ae7a9e432aa965c6d90575b711c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robablo Comics", "Tyler Hueffmeier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Robablo Comics"], "esrb_rating": null}
