It was one of the first games ever made and by far the most popular one at that time. Even though it's a simple game, it was fun and challenging game. The objective was to try to score as many points as possible, beat the record and stay alive. Very simple, yet extremely satisfying,\u00a0This game is my attempt to recreate an old classic. I hope you'll enjoy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>WASD + Space to shoot<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T07:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/540/5403b449b6f6a6b8109bbf8738d57954.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OL Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
