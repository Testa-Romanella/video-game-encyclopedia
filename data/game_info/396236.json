Thus inspired, I downloaded Ren'Py myself with the intention of making a serious Honkmaki fic-as-VN. Instead, I got about two lines of dialogue written and ran with it into shitpost territory. Though to call this a shitpost is probably a gross insult to shitposts.</p>\n<p>Anyway, for completeness' sake, and as a counterpoint to my upcoming (and vastly improved) shitpost visual novel, Fairy Godmari, I'm uploading this here, though if I had any sense I'd probably let it rot.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T02:52:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c33ac04611fd4cb7bd6b3c8d462c9c0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sophie Ayase"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
