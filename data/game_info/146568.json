The game is not finished and is only really playable if you fudge it. Input intervals for the moves are a little wonky but hopefully you can see what I was going for. It's meant to play in the style of games like Harmoknight, Bit.trip Runner or Rhythm Heaven.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f7/8f739a44e5419b7931412c2526cc3b95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Love"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
