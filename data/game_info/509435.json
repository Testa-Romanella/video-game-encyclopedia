Use the tool/tools available to you to escape unharmed. Who knows what lurks in the darkness.<br/><br/>There is no story in this version, but we would only consider developing further on the project if any interest is shown. The basic gameplay is finished, but this is only a PROTOTYPE made in a little over a week. Which should be kept in mind.\u00a0<br/><br/>Please let us know if you have any thoughts about the game, and enjoy what's there, although it isn't much as we're mostly new to this stuff.<br/><br/>Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T05:49:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4cb9f58425645371c64064fb21642ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonas Vendler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
