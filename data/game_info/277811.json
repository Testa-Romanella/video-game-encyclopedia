Then for our enemies we thought of Alebrijes, which are brightly coloured Mexican folk art sculptures usually made with cardboard or paper of chimera-like creatures. Our main character, Pedro, we based on Pedro Linares, the original creator of Alebrijes 80 years ago.</p>\n<p>The player will get the opportunity to change the set Pedro\u2019s wearing and this will change the weapon and throwable object, the set is random and since the player never knows what they\u2019re getting they have to take the decision of either stick to what they have or try for a different one.<br/></p>\n<p>You can see more of what I (Erika, 3D artist) did in the project (made by a team of 4) here.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eedab9da0d0e02b7de8db89465467830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erika M"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
