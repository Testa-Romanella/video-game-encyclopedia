Our goal is to increase teens' self-positivity through a brief embodied VR experience.</p>\n<p>Power posing is a simple and effective manipulation that increases positive emotions and reduces negative body image. The manipulation is simple, short, and ideal for everyday practice. By bringing power posing into VR, we hope to reach a broad audience and encourage positivity through this bottom up embodiment experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Jonathan Ogilvy: Producer<br/>Veronica Weser: Research<br/>Lisa Lokshina: UX<br/>Saul Pena Gamero: Developer\u00a0<br/>Scott Tongue: Developer\u00a0<br/>David Lobser: Developer<br/>David Gochfeld: Developer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T15:14:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a59d62347180d2f83f1c9aa82cda66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["vtheyoshi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
