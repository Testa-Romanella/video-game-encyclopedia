In this puzzle game you try to make your way to the end without touching any circles. But every circle responds to you differently. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to go around them, other times your speed or direction are key. Every level offers something new.<br/><br/>After you completed the game, there's two secret modes that completely change how you think about the levels. For when you like a bit more challenge. <br/><br/>The main game is not a particularly hard, more chill and easy-going. You play on your own pace, and discover the game's rules as you go. It takes about an 1.5h to complete everything with modes included. <br/><br/>Be curious and have fun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T07:31:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/51600186807c0f1b1b6f8c9a961ad391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Jeroen Wimmers"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Jeroen Wimmers"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
