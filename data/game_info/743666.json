But somehow I couldn't open his \"My Level\" and \"Artist\" screens, and I still don't know what they looked like, so I designed them myself and added some new gameplay features.   <br/> <br/>I was the only one to make this game. I only knew how to write code, but I was not good at art, game design and operation and publicity.  However, I will try my best to improve the game and fix the bugs so as to bring you a better game experience. At the same time, I will accumulate experience for the game I want to make next. Thank you for your understanding and support.  <br/><br/>Next, I would like to add some innovative gameplay to the game, such as:  <br/><ul><li>Rotate the fragment randomly to increase the difficulty  <br/></li><li>Added multiplayer matchups and timed challenges  <br/></li><li>Added playback of other players' play sessions  <br/></li><li>Improved editor features to make level building easier  </li></ul> <br/>If you have better suggestions or ideas, feel free to leave a comment.  <br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T03:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a80b938e1dc2c91b2b2cec8f8c7955.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u788e\u7247\u7eaa\u5143\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u788e\u7247\u7eaa\u5143\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
