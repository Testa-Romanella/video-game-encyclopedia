This game was a Christmas present for my sister Hillary in 2013.  </p><p>Use the arrow keys to navigate the Eskimo and find all the Christmas presents!</p><p>This game has quite a few bugs, and there is a small glitch after clicking the Play Again button after finding all the presents, the player is unable to move until you click on him or her.  I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but I haven't gotten around to fixing it, since I've moved onto other things.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1b6b0579443d141e2ba2475c5a183ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pinwheel Games & Animation"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
