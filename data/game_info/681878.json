Kontrol/Inspector is well regarded even today, and it's a game many people play to play with friends. You're hunting food in the kitchen, culling enemies for points, and collecting items by collecting juicy numbers of 'Seedlets'. To claim more Seedlets, you'll have to open up bigger and bigger boxes, and every time a box is opened, higher seeds are born. You'll have to collect as many Seedlets as you can to unlock new and more powerful features, and what's more, if you pick up a new seed by clicking it, you'll try and claim it even if it's on the ground.\n\nThere are also new features that allow you to increase the speed of food gathering - for example, you can now throw a stack of correct-sized food into a cooking pot before you do it. This easy-to-use feature is further combined with a collection of 'Seedlets' and, well, this is if you're into that sort of thing. As you collect many of these new Seedlets, you'll be able to gain access to the's new.\n\nWhat is this that you have to gather, then?
