It was a short Unity first-person platformer that had you collecting 5 \"coins\" around a map that was structured like, you guessed it, a tower.</p>\n<p>Flash to some years later, and the Unity player that allowed The Tower to be uploaded to Kongregate was dead. Unfortunately, this meant I had lost the original files to play the game, too. The Tower was lost to time.</p>\n<p>So, I\u00a0decided to make it anew -- with a brand new environment, and a lot of extended content. This was mostly an exercise to get some experience in the Unity game engine, but I tried my best to make it a full experience that you should get an hour or so of gameplay out of. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T17:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2aebe08f09a66f17bd3c059e107a979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBR"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
