Steal everything from groceries to pets from a crazy pet store while avoiding the police in this crazy shoplifting simulator. Plan the perfect jewelry heist and strategically shoplift while avoiding shoppers who would love nothing more than to call the police. Teeny Heist is a top down point and click game in which you need to steal enough valuable items to complete the level. Completing a level without getting busted allows you to keep your cash which is used to unlock new levels and skins. You have to be strategic and aware to be successful as shoppers will call the police so you must be careful! When the cops are called it adds more police to the level increasing the chances of you getting arrested. Each level contains a limited number of banana peels which you must use wisely to prevent getting busted as this is your only means of defense against the overly aggressive police officers. Teeny Heist launches with three levels, two of which must be unlocked by stealing enough money.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cad/cad94c6d2d1731eb44517682cb3402fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 26}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Burning Red Design"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Burning Red Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
