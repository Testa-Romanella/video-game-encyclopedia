You are tasked with delivering a package to Area 64, a top secret base hidden somewhere in the town. The only problems are: you don't have anything other than what you can find around town, You're told to keep the package 'alive' (whatever that means), and to top it all off you don't even know where Area 64 is! There are six different music tracks in the game so ake sure to have your sound on!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>The game's controls are simple. At the end of each passage you are given a number of options in the form of blue links. Just click the links with your mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> In order to interact with certain inventory items you need to click the relevent button in the sidebar.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Save System</strong><br/>The game comes packed with a save/load system. In order to save press save and in order to load press load (surprisingly enough). After getting certain types of game overs you are able to just return to the moments right before you died, however if you get a game over for one of the following reasons: Getting 'caught', fatigue being too high, or torch power running out you will need to restart the game.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can press the little &lt; button at the top of the sidebar to go back to the previous turn.</p>\n\n<p>Check the game out on the Ludum Dare website at: link</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:27:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8fd0551af0c15d7aabc057b091ee65f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adamwatters310"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
