{"id": 599940, "slug": "captain-hookfoot", "name": "Captain Hookfoot", "name_original": "Captain Hookfoot", "description": "<p>Captain Hookfoot is a project that we at Twisted Bubble Massacre have loved working on and are very passionate about. We hope to bring the experiences of Marg, the newest crewmate and the daughter of Captain Hookfoot, to you, pulling you through the humorous conversations, lovable characters, and the relationships you\u2019ll make, learning about your father\u2019s crew as you go along. Each character has their own set of charms, such as my personal favorite, Boomstick, who is an angry little ball of explosions who can\u2019t really speak but the crew understands anyway. Through the story, we hope to show that working together often gives better results than working alone. Our inspirations stem from the Goonies and other pirate-themed content such as <em>Secret of Monkey Island</em>. We hope to bring those nostalgic feelings to the older audience who watched the Goonies as youths and give the same wonder they brought to children to the kids of today. As for the story, well, matey, you\u2019re gonna have to find that treasure yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We are no longer working on this and will most likely not touch this, but it is something that we are proud of. We had a month-and-a-half of development time as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:47:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85eb5da703c4aaf82b1e71f35c3d9866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dnekos", "scyfer1", "Pogo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
