Click a target to hop to it. If it's an adjacent target the sphere will duplicate, otherwise the sphere jumps to the target.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll the adjacent spheres to the target you hopped to become your color.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTry to dominate the board, the one with the most spheres of his color on the board wins!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>I'd love to hear your feedback, did you like the gameplay? Do you understand how it works without much trouble? Did you find it hard or is it too easy? What do you think I should add?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/634/634a2b3f2218e8c1c1a157379bc68cd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ava"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
