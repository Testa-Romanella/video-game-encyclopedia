Inspired by japanese cyberpunk and Escape from New York, featuring gritty retro graphics with modern touches.<br/><br/><h3>DISCOVER NEW WEAPONS, ABILITIES &amp; LOCATIONS</h3>In true Metroidvania-style, the tools you acquire will grant you access to new areas, ways to fight your enemies, and solve puzzles.<h3>FIGHT CYBERNETIC HORRORS</h3>Fast-paced and unique combat. As you roam around the levels you'll constantly run into new monster designs to keep you on your toes. And, instead of having firearms, you\u00b4ll do more than just aim &amp; shoot at things.<h3>GRITTY RETRO AESTHETICS</h3>Combining both modern &amp; old school tech, black &amp; white visuals and vibrant colors, you'll always have surprises ahead. One area might be dark and gritty with menacing monsters, the other a parade of colours with fast-paced arcade combat.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T05:37:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b6dae2ac65436087ac6e6c00d626ef.jpg", "website": "https://platonicpartnership.com/vhs", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 18, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Platonic Partnership"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Platonic Partnership"], "esrb_rating": null}
