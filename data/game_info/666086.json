{"id": 666086, "slug": "stuck-davron28", "name": "Stuck (davron28)", "name_original": "Stuck (davron28)", "description": "<p>It is a short game where you play as a person that works in a railway booth who gets stuck inside.\u00a0 The reason is that a train with zombies crashed near you and now the\u00a0booth is\u00a0surrounded by them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>It is the first game I ever uploaded on any site. Since game development is more of a hobby to me than a job or something to study, there are some things that look, behave or sound unprofessional (animations in particular). And since I modeled everything myself for the first time, the overall look of the game is, in my opinion, not that good either. However, I still wanted to share the game on the website and have people play it since it will hopefully allow me to improve. So, if there is any feedback you would like to leave, please do.</p>\n<p>Thank You.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02f/02f1c61bef28bc8f45b0eef3ed5f3911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["davron28"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
