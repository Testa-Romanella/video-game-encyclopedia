The objective of the game is to trap your opponent on a single tile of the board. Play alternates between players and\u00a0consists of two parts; a move and a removal. Move to any adjacent space then remove any tile on the board. If you cannot move on your turn, you have lost the game.</p>\n<p>This game is based on a real-life board game I found on holiday in my early teens; nobody else seems to have heard of it. I have adapted it to have slightly more replay value. This includes:</p>\n<ul><li>8 different game boards, each requiring their own unique strategy</li><li>4 \"drop\" modes to restrict tile removal</li><li>A \"one-touch\" mode</li><li>A \"timed\" game\u00a0and multiple game \"match\" modes</li><li>Additionally, there are four different \"time of day\" display modes and a lower graphic setting for less powerful computers</li></ul>\n<p><em>Isolation</em> was originally intended as a local 2-player competitive game. However, I have programmed a primitive AI for single-player games. It isn't particularly clever at the moment, but it has beaten me. I may improve this in a future release.<br/></p>\n<p>Full play instructions can be viewed in the Options menu. I recommend you take a moment to read them through thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to my colleague Alex for the additional programming work and the staff at Procedural Worlds for both their support and the exceptional tools which have been used to make this project possible.</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0www.persephoneschair.com</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0www.twitter.com/PersephoneChair</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0http://discord.gg/persephoneschair</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:42:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e45/e45309b4a8dac004e16912fff714d250.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Persephone's Chair"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
