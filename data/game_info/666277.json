In this game, you control a single helicopter, while an army of planes has been sent to bring you down..only one problem: Due to a processing mix-up, none of the planes have working artillery...so they have resorted to simply attempting to ram you out of the sky! Shoot them down with the space bar for points, and dodge the rest.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:53:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0c/f0c99fb686e213db5c4f597ba05ea506.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CynthiasGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
