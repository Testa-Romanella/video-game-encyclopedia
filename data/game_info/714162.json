In this game, the \"Koomps\" (the green guys) must collect coins and flee from the \"Cosht\" (the red guy). The Cosht can use his laser beam to take away money from the Koomps.</p>\n<p>After 3 minutes, the game end, and  the Koomp with the most money wins. But beware, because if you can't get at least 20 coins, the Cosht wins.</p>\n\n<p>To play a game, the players must be on the same wifi. One player while be the host, and must give his IP adress to other players. To get your IP adress, you must open a program called \"cmd\", and type \"ipconfig\". Your IP adress is what's on the right of \"IPV4 Adress\". You must also select a port; you can choose anything, but sometimes your port will be used by other programs. But generally, if you use the port \"7777\" it will work.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or feedback, you can use the comment section!
