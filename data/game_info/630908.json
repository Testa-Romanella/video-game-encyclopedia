Andr\u00e9s worked as our PM, assigning deadlines and roles of each one of us. We had two reviewing layers, where Sebasti\u00e1n, Max, and B\u00e1rbara reviewed each other\u2019s slices in the first review. Then, Andr\u00e9s was the final reviewer. We also experimented by connecting to a memoQ server which had an additional security layer (a VPN!). We could create online termbases, translation memories, use documents previews and harnessed all the tools our chosen CAT tool had to offer. It was a great learning experience while localizing this game content into neutral Latin American Spanish, so as to make it sound natural in any country within this region.</p>\n<p>Don't miss checking out our logs on how we lived this jam!<br/></p>\r\nTeam members\r\n<p>Andr\u00e9s Ureta<br/></p><p>B\u00e1rbara Rivera</p><p>Maximiliano Rojas</p><p>Sebastian Erasmy<br/><br/></p><p>You can find more info about us on our Itch.io profile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T03:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e29cd1dc46c241e87cc0134ddcf5dcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Tetraforce"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
