The player controls Alisia, a young woman who is on a quest to avenge her father and save the world. She can fire lightning from her hands and summon four faithful beasts to aid her.<br />\nThe game was released outside Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator instead of the dainty-looking sorceress she originally was. Due to the lack of publicity for the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make a big impact on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-18T20:29:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/579/579fc62223469a69693da321e3b0e727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["GAME ARTS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
