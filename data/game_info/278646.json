That was, until he was wrongfully plucked from the ocean and sentenced to pet-hood. But as the bombs shake the earth asunder, Sir Octavius seizes his opportunity to escape captivity through the grimy, irradiated sewers. The player will join Sir Octavius as he battles his way through waves of mutated fish and icky sewer slime to make it back to his kingdom.</p>\n<p><em>OctoKnight</em>\u00a0is an action-filled top-down dungeon crawler survival game with unique controls and combat mechanics. Being an octopus, Sir Octavius can use his eight tentacles to equip up to eight items. What Sir Octavius has equipped alters his movement and fighting style. In order to most effectively use his many tentacles, Sir Octavius has decided that the most effective fighting style is to spin at the enemy, flailing his weapons in a storm of pointy doom. When a player picks up an item, it is attached to that specific leg, so the player must rotate Sir Octavius in order to attack enemies. And if the player equips armor, they must rotate to the shielded side to deflect enemy attacks. But Sir Octavius must be strategic in his movements as too many hits will crack his fishbowl and leave him to die. How long can you survive?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/310/3107153a91f3459c4e436a5c70a0d53d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["niro0583", "Adam Ten Hoeve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
