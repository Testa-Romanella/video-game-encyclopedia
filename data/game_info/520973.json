You've just been working on a game for multiple 12 hour days, with very little breaks. You're tired, but the end is in sight, all you have to do is implement your inventory system and a shop, and the game will be in a playable state. And then bugs pile on top of each other, you're forced to restart the inventory from scratch, and you're running out of time. This is what happened to me. This game is not what I wanted it to be. Originally, it was going to be an adventure game with coins, many enemies, interesting locales, and a fully fledged item and shop system. However, as things kept failing and the deadline crept closer, I had to drastically alter the shape of the game. Now, you collect gems. I'm hoping that the technical prowess involved in the features is enough to boost up my grade for this one, and that all the hours i put into it will not go unrewarded.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9b/a9bdf81c183cddbd58ce21ee7768b24b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyan Wing"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
