Rely too much on the slow-moving 'spell' projectiles, for example, and the enemies will begin to shift around to avoid them. It's an interesting idea that has been quite well implemented.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"More puzzly than roguelike, this game is a series of open-arena matches against the same boss monster over and over - but on each new level that boss monster changes in response to what the player did on the previous level. Might need work for balance, but an awesome prototype of an idea.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tInnovation\r\n\t: 3/3 - \"I've not seen anything like this done before.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFun: 2/3 - \"Worth my time playing\" because of the metamorphosis.\", \"The concept is an interesting one and leads to some novel strategic thinking.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tScope: 2.5/3 - \"The author managed something impressive\"\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>Controls and instructions are in the README</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tCEO, Programming, Design\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tJunber\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDesign, Testing, Marketing\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tHisfantor\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Have fun, lowercase_games</strong><br/>\r\n\tTwitter Reddit\r\n\u00a0Instagram\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce47a3967fac48178c4ae4d684cfe80c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lowercase_games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
