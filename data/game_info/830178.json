Here, Rick and John are still inexperienced trainees who are just learning to be cops. <br/><br/>Another day at the police academy goes awry when unrest breaks out in the city. To make matters worse, a \"rat\" who works with the local mafia has turned up at the police station. And, of course, only two student cops can defy all the trouble!<br/><br/>Like the original game, The Academy is inspired by SWAT 4 and cop TV shows. A fresh take on top-down shooters with an emphasis on tactics where decisions have to be made in a split second. Rescue hostages, neutralize criminals and defuse bombs in single-player or co-op mode. And remember, shooting first is not the best decision!<br/><br/><ul><li>3 new missions and locations, plus the police academy training ground. Help young Rick and John become brutal cops!<br/></li><li>The Surrender System allows you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.<br/></li><li>Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return.<br/></li><li>Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.<br/></li><li>As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.<br/></li><li>Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.<br/></li><li>Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.<br/></li><li>All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!<br/></li><li>Co-op. Complete mission together for better scores and more fun!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T12:26:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218fa0654f03540e1c7527b0014abd87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.25, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 218, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HypeTrain Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HypeTrain Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
