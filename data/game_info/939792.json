The girl fights the dragon with forward rolls, jumps, and a wand that controls the dragon. Even if she is attacked by a dragon, she can heal herself with magic that heals wounds.<br/><br/><strong><h3>The wand to control dragons</h3></strong>If the girl wins the battle, she can control the dragon with the power of her wand. The controlled  dragons will fight at her signal and protect her when she's stuck, but she's never controlled a dragon before.<br/><br/>BGM : MaouDamashii, SKIPMORE, Ichthyostego", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T03:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2beee7060b2f025ef773d7ac73bc127.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["\u3044\u304f\u3061\u304a\u3059\u3066\u3054"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["\u3044\u304f\u3061\u304a\u3059\u3066\u3054"], "esrb_rating": null}
