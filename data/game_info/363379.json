Based on\u00a0this Small Robots post we have created a toolkit to make your own custom 'bots! It works in the browser and should be fairly straightforward to use! Just pick up the parts and plop them on the robot. You can change the robot's base shape with the menu on the top right. You use the right mouse button to rotate the camera and the mouse wheel to zoom!</p>\n<p>Have fun!
