There are a few buildings to create a small economy and gain more residents. You can either play endless and relax a bit or go for a highscore in one of the timed modes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>warehouse is\u00a0</strong>your central building which gives you range to build. Every other building needs to be conntected to it via\u00a0<strong>paths </strong>to function<strong>.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0First you should build some <strong>residence </strong>to gain gold and workers.\u00a0Workers are necessary to production buildings, like a fisher or a woodhut. A <strong>fisher </strong>produces fish which is is consumed by your residents. This increases the amount of residents you have per house and also gives you more gold. The <strong>woodhut </strong>produces wood, which allows you to build more buildings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left click: select tile</li><li>Right click: deselect tile, scroll the screen</li><li>Mouse wheel: zoom in/out</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Building descriptions</strong></p>\r\nWarehouseunlocks at 50 residentsIs the starting point of the game and increases your build range and stock.Pathunlocks at\u00a00 residentsIs necessary to connect production buildings and residences with warehouse.Residenceunlocks at\u00a00 residentsInhabits residents that increase the gold income and can be workers for production buildings.
