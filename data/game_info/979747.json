You might yell. You might even curse. And it's not sure if \"friends\" will still be friends afterwards. But in any case, Tiny Balls will offer extremely fun game sessions.<br/><br/><strong>Please note: Tiny Balls cannot be played alone! To start one of the game modes, a minimum number of two players is required in the lobby! It is recommended that you buy the game together with at least 2-3 friends. </strong><br/><br/><h3>KNOCKOUT MODE:</h3> Basically a \"Last Marble Standing\" mode where you have to knock your friends off platforms. Do you risk using the boost to push a friend off the edge, even though you could catapult yourself out in the worst case scenario?<br/><br/><br/><h3>FREEZE MODE:</h3> A \"game of tag\" mode where a certain number of players randomly become \"hunters\" at the start of the match. The hunters must hit all the non-hunters, causing the non-hunters to be frozen and unable to move. However, frozen ones can be unfrozen by being touched by a friend. If all non-hunters are frozen at the same time, the hunters win.<br/><br/><br/><h3>RACE MODE:</h3> A heated and fast-paced racing fun where you not only want to be the first to cross the finish line, but also hit your friends as many times as possible along the way to gain a speed boost!<h3>GAME HIGHLIGHTS:</h3><ul><li> competitive multiplayer fun for up to 12 players (online &amp; LAN)<br/></li><li> 3 game modes<br/></li><li> for each mode there are 4 maps<br/></li><li> physically correct marbles that you control yourself<br/></li><li> marble is customizable<br/></li><li> fast, short sessions<br/></li><li> easy to understand, hard to master</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T13:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74ffe46f432857b48183ed4058b607a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Poems"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixel Poems"], "esrb_rating": null}
