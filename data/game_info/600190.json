Player One (wearing the headset) has to try and explain the word they are given without saying the word, if their teammate correctly guesses the word then Player One hits the correct button to continue. Throughout the game you will be given distractions with a time limit to complete. You get a point for every correct guess and lose a point for every distraction failed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also a practice arena to play around in, it's recommended to do this first to get familiar with the distractions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To make the game more involved and entertaining for the team waiting their turn, cast the game to a TV or a Laptop, just make sure that player two can't see the the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*** Please note that this is an early release of the game and I have many ideas to add in the future***</p>\n<p>If you have ideas on things that could be added or improvements that could be made, please leave a review with your thoughts.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T09:56:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b6/5b65b1cb63cbf224b3d579bf7d0f6cf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Noodlesthenoob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
