While it's not very impressive yet, we are planning to expand it much more in the future, after the Lisp Game Jam 2019, for which this game was initially created.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The player can be controlled by either WASD or arrow keys. Space makes the player jump, although this does not do much yet, down or S makes the player crouch, ENTER makes the player shoot.\u00a0 [I] near the player's health means \"invincible\".<br/></p>\n<p>The player has 100 HP,\u00a0 so do the enemies. They will come from the sides of the screen and shoot you if they get close enough. \u00a0Escape closes the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3a/d3ab4ba6c3aae5497693f7d88888772b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pavel Kulyov", "vaartis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
