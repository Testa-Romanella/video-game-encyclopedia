After testing the proverbial waters of Novice difficulty, face the rigor of Expert difficulty and see if you have what it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlong with these mini-game challenges, you can jump into the Battle Simulator. The first person shooters of the 1990\u2019s that kept the arcades alive for at least another decade have been integrated into C3-ZR's Coliseum. Try your hand at this fast-paced wave combat across multiple environments which each provide unique challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, without further ado, let the games begin!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab8/ab8d3443315cd0ff2e79536083416647.jpg", "website": "https://www.monarchy.media/triggerfinger", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monarchy Media"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monarchy Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
