Stored energy is represented by color from green (low) to red (high). Crystals break after reaching a certain threshold. Energy is generated and stored in the balls based on the speed of each collision and released when hitting a crystal. The ball that breaks a crystal gets destroyed and excess energy is added to the total score.</p>\n<p>I didn't really have time to add a win screen or different levels, but the game is supposed to be over when all crystals are destroyed.</p>\n<p>Also, the balls are meant to be unstable as well and explode when loaded with too much energy, but since I had no time to add audio / visual feedback for the exploding balls I felt like it would be too confusing, so I removed it for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse - Aim and hold left mouse button to shoot by moving the cue forward<br/>R - Restart level <br/>Esc - Quit game<br/></p>\n<p>You can move around freely while balls are in play and moving using wasd, shift, space and left alt / ctrl.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T09:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11d/11df21940867996caf43a2427f6e6bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TastiHam"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
