Basically now it's just an unfinished driving game with no defined mission. Just enjoy driving the <em>pickup truck</em> around the track, maybe try to do some <em>drifting</em> or tricks because the car is capable of that.\u00a0\n<p>If you decide to try it you are <strong><em>AWESOME</em></strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nIf you don't know it already, since the game is free you can use the game assets for your own projects. If you are a developer and you need some of the assets just let me know and you'll have them for free.<br/>\r\nWhat's new?<ul><li>Different car setups (original, drift, offroad)</li><li>Added bridges, ramp, and wall ride</li><li>More parts of the map are accessible</li><li>Easter Eggs</li><li>Added more vegetation and rocks</li><li>Small fixes</li></ul><p>Read Devlog for more information about \"<em>what's new?\"\u00a0</em>and<em> Easter Eggs.</em></p>\r\nBoring stuff about self promotion\r\n<p><em>Save yourself some time and don't read it.</em></p>\r\nIf you'd like to SHARE it with friends and maybe follow me on my social media to see the development process. A huge project is coming and you can see behind the scenes.\u00a0\u00a0You can follow my\u00a0Instagram\u00a0for that.
