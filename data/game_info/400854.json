With Peg Pals you can - and have a ton of fun in the process.<br/><br/>Peg Pals provides thousands of puzzles based on the classic triangular peg puzzle theme. BUT with a unique twist and with unlimited hints so that you can learn how to solve any puzzle.  You also can set up your own puzzles if you prefer.<br/><br/>The puzzles don\u2019t necessarily just consist of a single peg removed from the board. <br/>The app removes a carefully calculated collection of pegs so that that resulting position is solvable. <br/><br/>The rules are simple: Starting from the initial puzzle position, jump over pegs into vacant spots. <br/>The jumped pieces are removed. Your goal is to end with just one peg left on the board. <br/><br/>The computer will show you move by move how to solve any puzzle! <br/><br/>Features <br/>\u2022 Smooth animation <br/>\u2022 Retina Graphics <br/>\u2022 Unlimited Undo <br/>\u2022 Unlimited Hints (moves that lead to a solution)<br/>\u2022 Optional solvable indicator that lets you know when you\u2019ve gone wrong. <br/>\u2022 Optional Timer <br/>\u2022 Puzzles can be relaxing enough to solve while standing in a grocery line. <br/>\u2022 Puzzles can be much more challenging \u2013 you decide. <br/>\u2022 Fast app switching is fully supported. <br/>\u2022 The state of the game is always saved.
