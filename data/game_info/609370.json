{"id": 609370, "slug": "revolver-and-co", "name": "Revolver and Co", "name_original": "Revolver and Co", "description": "It's 2038, and a late maniacal inventor has left behind a legacy of madness - coordinates to an island full of wealthy robots, a gun that asks questions, and a widow that's hired you to answer them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRevolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOr if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T02:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/167/1678222d816f6b93c7abef587837cdcc.jpg", "website": "http://chequered.ink/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chequered Ink"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Chequered Ink"], "esrb_rating": null}
