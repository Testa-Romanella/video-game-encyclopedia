Shooting depletes chip ammo and eventually causes you to lose a life. Killing enemies and picking up salsa grants points. Gain one life for every 1000 points. Game is saved every time you touch a checkpoint and every time you die. Game keeps save even after exiting and will continue at last checkpoint touched when pressing the \"Continue\" button on the main menu. Press escape to access the pause menu and leave the game at any time. </p><p><strong>Info:</strong><br/></p><p>Salsa Warrior is a short 2D platformer developed in my spare time off work. It is my first game and I learned a lot from the development and hope you all enjoy. The game follows a chip who must manage his lives carefully to make it to the final level and reach the salsa he has dreamed of. You must face other creatures that stand in your way and reach the salsa bowls at the end of each level. Inspired by an idea my younger sister came up with.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p><ul><li>6 unique levels to complete</li><li>2 boss fights</li><li>4 enemy types</li><li>3 different environments to see</li><li>Preset lives that must be managed throughout the whole game</li><li>Original sprites/soundtrack/sounds/etc...</li></ul><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p><ul><li>Seems to be a little low in fps but I will continue to test this and look for a fix.</li></ul><p><strong>HELP?:</strong><br/></p><p>Feel free to contact me to report any issues or suggestions.
