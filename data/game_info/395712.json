The problem is, these monsters are very much capable of killing them. Use your own magic to assist the overly stubborn saviour of our universe by teleporting them away from danger.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The only button used in this game is the spacebar. Alva will continue to walk foward every couple of seconds unless you hold down space, causing Alva to be teleported backwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Flying skulls and slimes will both kill Alva, resetting the current room.</p>\n<p>Glowing doors act as portals, teleporting Alva between them.</p>\n<p>Arrows will point Alva in their respective directions.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p><p>Almost all art and assets created by Ansimuz and available to purchase here (https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/tiny-rpg-dungeon/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:56:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angeredjester"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
