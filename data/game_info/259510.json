You need to vacuum three of them to be able to shoot love one time. (You won't be able to vacuum until you shoot !)</li><li>His body will slam the ground to create fire barriers that you can avoid by jumping over them.</li><li>His hand will chase you and slam the ground to create fire pillars that will explode two seconds after they appeared. Touching the hand can also cause damage to you.</li></ul>\n<p>To befriend to future friend, you need to aim for his head ! Don't bother trying to shoot love at his body or his hand, it won't have any effect.

At the end of each phase, a health pickup will be dropped.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made using the Godot Engine.
