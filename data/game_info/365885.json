No, but this one can. Polar bear Ben is the cutest and the coolest flying bear in the world!<br/><br/>Will you help guide this cute polar bear through the sky and join him on a fun adventure?<br/><br/>Ben found himself in a tough situation. It is too late to turn back, he is flying too fast and in a few seconds, he will be surrounded by nasty spikey creatures.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ben's Sky Runner was developed by an indie developer PreyCat9 and it adopts the gameplay of an infinite runner through the sky and it uses a polar bear named Ben as its main character.<br/><br/>The game is not easy so it is going to present a certain challenge to every player. Also, the difficulty progresses as time passes by.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04a/04a54ab5794bfbace4aac6fc5ae1c3da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PreyCat9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
