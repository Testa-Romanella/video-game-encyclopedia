{"id": 323931, "slug": "lonely-muffin-demo-1", "name": "Lonely Muffin [Demo 1]", "name_original": "Lonely Muffin [Demo 1]", "description": "<p>Lonely Muffin is a dumb little RPG with a heavy focus on atmosphere. Demo 1 is about 2 hours long and should give you a first impression of what this game is going to be. I should mention that this game features some pretty heavy subject matter (Even though it is still only hinted at in this demo). So please only proceed if you are comfortable with that kind of stuff.<br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You play as Muffin, a lonely, young boy, who struggles with frequent nightmares. As Muffin decides to leave his house to visit the doc, he notices that the world has changed a lot since the last time he went outside. Fortunately a strange dead man called Skully decides to help Muffin out. The bizarre adventure begins here.</p>\r\n Gameplay\r\n<p>This game is an RPG, so you will be exploring environments, fight monsters and level up your characters. Fights will be done in turn based encounters. Exploring your environments will reward you with outfits that change Muffin's physical appeariance.<br/></p>\r\nOther stuff\r\n<p>This is the first time I upload one of my games to the internet. I hope you have a good time with this small demo. This game was made in RPG Maker 2003 (Steam version). You don't need any programs to run this game though. I should point out that I didn't really make this game for people to play. I used this game as a tool to express my thoughts and feelings. You might want to keep that in mind while playing. Anyways I'm looking foward to hear people's opinions on the game. If you want to reach out to me directly, you can dm me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Ochinchinigami). Also I'm not a native English speaker, so sorry in advance for any spelling errors. If you find any, hit me up and I'll fix it for the final release. Some (or rather most) sentences in the game are intentionally weird though. lol<br/></p>\r\nThank you so much for taking your time!\r\n\n<p>-Spectrophobia</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/3077fb71ac5a3f6e1f0a3eec09ccda7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spectrophobia"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
