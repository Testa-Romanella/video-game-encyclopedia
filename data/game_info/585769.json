There are definitely going to be physics engine updates because I love physics</p>\n<p>\u00a0sorry for my English I am Dutch</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T10:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f5/2f59dc0907e3263f875fd60f2ce8967c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brentdev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
