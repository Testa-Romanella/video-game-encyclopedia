If a field card is on your grid, the robin might appear and steal it after five moves - if not prevented by you (for example by finishing the field group it is sitting on or scaring it away).</p>\r\nEVALUATION\r\n<p>card structures of a type of card will be evaluated instantly, once they meet the criteria listed in the CARD TYPES. Through clever placement of your cards you might be able to get more points out of your deck than initially expected.<br/></p>\r\nHAVE FUN!
