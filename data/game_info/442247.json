As such, I wanted to try and make something a bit more mechanic focused with depth and complexity, it's not super deep but it is pretty complex.</p>\n<p>Since the theme was As You Wish I decided to lean into the Princess Bride theme and recreate the fencing scene from that movie (As you wish is a reference to the movie).</p>\n<p>The controls take a little bit of figuring out, but I genuinely really like how it turned out. The approximate time working on this game in total was about 24 hours, I had a version that was much more polished up than this but I am deciding to maintain the buggy, incomplete version that was built across the true span of the game jam (a total of 48 hours I believe).</p>\n<p>============================================================<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/6463b3f9c4cb0352b5e90caf3e52ba7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["botbook"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
