The game has hit such a nerve with people - I've seen it played in pubs, on buses, even half way up a mountain side whilst holidaying in Italy - which I doubt will ever happen to my version (please send photographic proof if you try it!)<br/> <br/>I initially contacted Hipster Whale early in 2015 about the prospect of a ZX81 conversion of Crossy Road, and I'll admit to being somewhat anxious as I waited for the reply, wondering quite what they'd make of this frankly crazy idea. At the time I'd thought very little beyond the idea that it could be cool, and a couple of mocked-up screens, but despite their hectic schedule they agreed to the project, and have been fully supportive of it since, and indeed named the game after liking my previous work on ZXagon.<br/> <br/>Originally I planned the game to be 2D - looking very much like the original Frogger on which it is based, but after Hipster Whale took such an interest in the project I felt that simply wouldn't cut it, and so forced myself into the whole 3D concept, which although sometimes doesn't look so great in a still image (much like Ant Attack &amp; One Little Ghost before it), works pretty well when everything is moving. As is usual with these projects, there were a number of false starts, and a major re-write towards the end of the development when the game quickly ran out of memory trying to get the level logic working.<br/> <br/> I'm very proud of the end result, which I think is about as close as a ZX81 can get to the majesty of the original. Okay, so there's none of the collectable nature of the original, but I think that the claustrophobic nature of the original has been preserved. As a last note, it's probably worth mentioning that, despite all the time I spent playing the original game for research, I'm still really quite awful at it!<br/> <br/>I've also been officially nerd-herded. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9bb7e0c2229ddbed2c95a8b638795ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
