The lights are on, and the front door is opened. But, the windows are all boarded up and the grass is overgrown. It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home.<br/><br/>You run to the front door since it\u2019s storming pretty bad. <br/><br/>\u201cHello!? Your pizza's here!\" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. <br/><br/>You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. <br/><br/>You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this creepy house. <br/><br/>Freely roam the strange house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive. <br/><br/>This may be your last pizza delivery.<br/><br/>In the mobile version of Emily Wants To Play, a bad storm causes the power to go out right away. But don't worry, Emily is here to help. :)<br/><br/>** PLEASE NOTE: Emily Wants To Play is only supported on the following devices:<br/>iPhone 6<br/>iPhone 6+<br/>iPhone 6s<br/>iPhone 6+s<br/>iPhone 7<br/>iPhone 7+<br/>iPhone8<br/>iPhone8+<br/>iPad Air 1<br/>iPad Air 2<br/>iPad Mini 3<br/>iPad Mini 4<br/>iPod Touch 6th generation<br/>And newer devices...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T18:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f705d8261c5ba4e16702b146d3429b3_x5MUlsc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SKH Apps"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Shawn Hitchcock"], "esrb_rating": null}
