The King of Nangarth has gone missing so it is up to you to find him and defeat the Dark Necromancer once and for all! Be warned young warrior, the necromancer is fierce and has sent his best servant, The Great Dark Warrior Thorg of Winstin, to do his bidding. Armed with your trusted lance and whatever weapons you may find, it is up to you to overcome all the fiends that Thorg and the necromancer put in your way. The fate of the world depends on you. Are you up to the challenge?Gameplay<br/>Necrolance is a single player, 2D platformer based off the style of a Gameboy Color game. In the game you play as both the protagonist and as the necromancer\u2019s knight, Thorg. The protagonist\u2019s campaign is more action based whereas Thorg\u2019s campaign is slightly more puzzle based (only slightly). In the protagonist\u2019s campaign, you are given a lance as your main weapon and can carry a secondary weapon. Secondary weapons are typically dropped by weapon wielding enemies that you defeat (either from mini-bosses or normal enemies). In addition to wielding different weapons, you can also buy upgrades throughout the game with currency that you collect through the levels.Features<ul><li> Play as different characters<br/></li><li>\t7 worlds (plus 3 outposts)<br/></li><li>\t7 Bosses + 12 mini-bosses<br/></li><li>\tNormal + Hard modes<br/></li><li>\tDialog<br/></li><li>\tOverworld Map<br/></li><li>\tCheckpoints <br/></li><li>\tCut scenes<br/></li><li>\tGameboy Styled Graphics<br/></li><li>\tChiptune music synthesized as you play (no prerecorded nonsense!)<br/></li><li>\tUnlockable color swap (2 other palettes)<br/></li><li>\tCustomizable Keyboard Controls <br/></li><li>\tCustomizable Sound Options<br/></li><li>\tWindowed or Full-Screen Display<br/></li><li>\tController support</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f411a8e49fe397507edc6f1dff3dcd2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monsoon Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Monsoon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
