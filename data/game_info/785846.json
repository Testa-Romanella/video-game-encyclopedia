You'll start with nothing but soon discover raw resources to collect. Refine and craft resources into machines to automate your harvesting, refining, and crafting tasks. Eventually, you will be able to link up your machines with conveyor belts and other gadgets to create large automated assembly lines. As you scale up, you will unlock more areas of the world to find new resources and machines to improve and expand your factory.<br/><br/>In this game, you build your factory the way you want. You'll have access to modular pieces that can be combined in many different ways to achieve your goals. You might like to take your time designing a perfectly efficient factory. Or perhaps you prefer a quick and sloppy approach so long as it gets the job done. There is no wrong way to play.<h3>COLLECT</h3>Discover and harvest the resources you find throughout the world.<br/><br/><h3>CRAFT</h3>Craft machines to automate your collection, refinement, and crafting tasks.<br/><br/><h3>AUTOMATE</h3>Scale up your factory with fully automated assembly lines.<br/><br/><h3>INNOVATE</h3>There are many different ways to accomplish a goal in Automation Station.
