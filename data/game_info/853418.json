Each target must receive one Ball.</p>\n<p>There are different zones with different effects, some of which slow the Balls down, speeds them up, or even make the Balls explode !</p>\n<p>Then, some zones are used to activate / deactivate other zones, and that's where the puzzle part of the game starts.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I publish (although not the first I made), and it was made in a bit more than a week, so there aren't many levels.
