{"id": 183642, "slug": "killer-con", "name": "Killer Con", "name_original": "Killer Con", "description": "<p>Battle eachother from the shadows, strike when it's to be the least expected, all whilst trying to stay anonymous.<br/>Fight it out in two different gamemodes or take it upon yourself to take down the bad guys. <br/><br/>Killer Con is a local party game featuring two gamemodes supporting 2-4 players; 'Classic' (standard settings with only 1 objective; find and kill the others whilst staying alive yourself) and 'Arcade' ('Classic' with the addition of NPC enemies and abilities). If you don't have anyone else around there's also the singleplayer option which puts you up against 3 hidden perpetrators. Identify and get to them before they slice everyone up! <br/><br/><br/>The game has taken inspiration from the older flash game 'Ninja convention' by dude4k.(April 19, 2011) and is built upon it's core concept with some additional mechanics here and there. Our plan is to continue the development by improving what's already there as well as adding new modes/mechanics desired by our players if interest is shown. So if you find the concept interesting we'd be eternally grateful if you considered thumbing our project up! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57f8909035a28d3afb7beef1f47b4c83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pundemicgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
