As childhood friends, she and Ichinari made a promise to pursue their dreams to become manga artists. She continued to work her hardest, with that promise and those feelings in the back of her mind, and before she knew it...she was drawing erotic manga?! Still, believing that if she continues drawing manga she'll one day be reunited with Ichinari, she pours her heart and soul into her porn. Sometimes she worries about the number of pairs of panties she gets through when she's working alone...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Nodoka Amabane</strong><br/>CV\uff1aChacha Warabi<br/><br/>\"A sweet yet sexy vixen on the outside, but inside she's pure, innocent (?) and hopelessly devoted to her Senpai.\"<br/><br/>A manga artist in one of the most popular dojinshi circles in the fan comics world. Ichinari was her Senpai and the only other member in their high school's manga club. He graduated before she could work up the courage to confess her feelings to him, but she's kept drawing manga to this day in the hope that she would meet him again. She was always a diamond in the rough, but she's now polished up nicely. Her path to drawing dojin was opened up to her by a scene in a magical girl anime where the heroine was tormented by the enemy, and behind her sweet outward appearance lies hidden - and kinky - depths!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Akira Higashibojo</strong><br/>CV\uff1aMei Hanazono<br/><br/>\"This powerful woman isn't to be trifled with, but as Ichinari's Onee-chan she tends to let him get away with almost anything.\"<br/><br/>Ichinari and Iori's editor. Being super into judo, she's never afraid to be blunt and get straight to the point. Ichinari was her first client, and she soon found herself falling for him.  She's got that big sister vibe to her and, although she can come down on him harshly, mostly she's putty in Ichinari's hands. Her company never refund her expenses, and she's always crying about her meager salary and terrible working conditions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f25/f25906d6ec5736ecbd5267678db8e7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 48, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 431, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NEKO WORK H"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NEKO WORKs"], "esrb_rating": null}
