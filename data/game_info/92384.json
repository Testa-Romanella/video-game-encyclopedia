The fireball has a cooldown time, watch the lower left corner.</li><li>Rotate the view by moving close to the edge of the screen, or with the A and D buttons on the keyboard.</li><li>Heal yourself by sitting down and keeping still. Lower your hand so Le Knight sits properly: bums on the ground, legs looking forward. If it is not comfortable, Le Knight can't heal. Keep your hand steady and after a while you'll see that your health start to increase.</li></ul><p>The Windows and Linux versions are untested.
