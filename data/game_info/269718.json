No problem! Use this app to take the place of your broken player. Game not included - just the mummy's voice!<br/><br/>Voice of the Mummy was the best board game ever created by the Milton Bradley company, and it was a ground-breaking product back in 1971. It had a three-level pyramidal board centered around a large, detailed sarcophagus that spoke to the players when a switch was flipped. Inside was a miniature record player, and each side of the record containing twenty randomized instructions for the players to follow. My family and I spent many hours listening to the spooky voice telling us to avoid the Slimy Snails of Aro, the One-Eyed Giant Mandrill, the Unholy Snakes of Amon, or the Death brought on by the Screeching Green Pestilence. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, my game is over forty years old now, and the record player hasn\u2019t worked for many years. Rather than paying someone to fix it, I made a little iOS app to play randomized messages in its place.<br/><br/>Flip the switch on the sarcophagus to play a random message. Tap the \"i\" icon in the lower-right, or press-and-hold to bring up a menu to flip the record for the second part of the game play. Hearing-impaired folks can even play the game now by turning on closed-captioning - read the instructions on the screen as the mummy says them!<br/><br/>TO PLAY the Voice of the Mummy game with this app, you will still need the physical board game and all its pieces; this app merely replaces the functionality that a broken record player can no longer provide.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b9913686221cb53768cfc093abee8ef_TBBZNIz.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ronald Logan"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Ronald Logan"], "esrb_rating": null}
