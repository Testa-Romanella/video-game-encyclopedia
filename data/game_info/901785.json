Robots relentlessly hunt you down. React quickly. The key to survival is to destroy them \u2014 before they destroy you! Rack up as many points as you can! It's you against them \u2026 to the end.</p>\n<p>Move your avatar with the W, A, S, and D keys. To use your gun, hold down one of the arrow keys; release the key to fire. After drawing or using your gun, your aim takes time to recover. The longer you hold the arrow key before shooting, the more accurate and the more deadly your shot will be.</p>\n<p>You have limited ammunition, but your tormentors have seen fit to drop more bullets into the maze.\u00a0 \u00a0More your avatar over the bullets to collect them.<br/></p>\n<p>Watch out for the patrolling robots! If they sense you, they will speed up and pursue you. If a robot gets close enough to grab you, it's all over! A single lucky shot may blast a robot to smithereens \u2026 or it may take two, three or more shots. Be careful!<br/></p>\n<p>For some unknown and twisted purpose, your tormentors are keeping a point score. Destroying a robot is worth 50 points, but this value increases as you earn a multiplier for style. The more risks you take, the greater your multiplier becomes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to survive as long as you can! Whether guided by malign calculations or by the sadistic whims of your captors, the robots are slowly getting faster and deadlier. How long can you last?<br/></p>\n<p>Design, art, and programming by Xin Jin Meng.
