So we crammed as much of it as \r\nwe possibly could into \"...fish\".</p><p>Over the course of roughly 20-25 hours we cobbled together as many death scenarios and hoity-toity sounding quotes that we could come up with\r\nto punctuate the experience. </p><p>You'll die. A lot. But keep exploring, there's always a new way to kick the bucket. </p><p>We had fun making it, but we don't plan on making another Poetic Experience again.\r\nEnjoy!</p><p>How to play: Click and drag mouse then release to swim.
