{"id": 237738, "slug": "russian-draughts", "name": "Russian Draughts", "name_original": "Russian Draughts", "description": "Russian Draughts is a classic board game.<br/><br/>The rules of this variant of game are:<br/><br/>Board. Played on a 8\u00d78 board with alternating dark and light squares. The left down square field should be dark.<br/>Starting position. Each player starts with 12 pieces on the three rows closest to their own side. The row closest to each player is called the \"crownhead\" or \"kings row\". Usually, the colors of the pieces are black and white, but possible use other colors (one dark and other light). The player with white pieces (lighter color) moves first.<br/>Pieces. There are two kinds of pieces: \"men\" and \"kings\". Kings are differentiated as consisting of two normal pieces of the same color, stacked one on top of the other or by inverted pieces.<br/>Men. Men move forward diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square.<br/>Kings. If a player's piece moves into the kings row on the opposing player's side of the board, that piece to be \"crowned\", becoming a \"king\" and gaining the ability to move back or forward and choose on which free square at this diagonal to stop .<br/>Capture. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the opponent's piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it. Jumping can be done forward and backward. Multiple-jump moves are possible if, when the jumping piece lands, there is another piece that can be jumped. Jumping is mandatory and cannot be passed up to make a non-jumping move. When there is more than one way for a player to jump, one may choose which sequence to make, not necessarily the sequence that will result in the most amount of captures. However, one must make all the captures in that sequence. A captured piece is left on the board until all captures in a sequence have been made but cannot be jumped again (this rule also applies for the kings).<br/>If a man touches the kings row during a capture and can continue a capture, it jumps backwards as a king. The player can choose where to land after the capture.<br/>Winning and draws. A player with no valid move remaining loses. This is the case if the player either has no pieces left or if a player's pieces are obstructed from making a legal move by the pieces of the opponent. A game is a draw if neither opponent has the possibility to win the game. The game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself for the third time, with the same player having the move each time. If one player proposes a draw and his opponent accepts the offer. If a player has three kings (or more) in the game against a single enemy king and his 15th move (counting from the time of establishing the correlation of forces) cannot capture enemy king.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e8273a230c8f8b45468987442550823.jpg", "website": "http://gfagame.com/checkers-online/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Oleg Sitdikov"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Oleg Sitdikov"], "esrb_rating": null}
