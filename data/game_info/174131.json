I'm releasing it just so that there is a downloadable version available somewhere. I can't remember where I left off, so there may be a lot of bugs or features that seem unfinished, but the core aspect of the editor should all be functional.</p>\n<p>In the editor, you are able to take photos of any terrain you make, and it will save it to your computer. In future play sessions, you have the option to revisit the terrains you have made while on the main menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3ed549163b9e8b3f5051e100e796e691.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JKUO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
