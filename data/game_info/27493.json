The goal is simple: escape with \n      your life. Fortunately, oxygen vending machines are scattered across the \n      whole station. Using those will be mandatory to reach Bob's shuttle in \n      time.\n    </p><p>\n      Run, gather coins, sneak past aliens, purchase oxygen, and you just \n      might make it. It definitely won't be easy though. Good luck Bob, and do \n      Rush it!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3d/a3d25107d8ccfc44b27b22e44022250f.jpg", "website": "http://www.takusanworks.com/shuttle-rush/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Takusan Works"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Takusan Works"], "esrb_rating": null}
