Shooting the laser will remove all power from your opponent. However, it must be aimed within an acceptable radius forwards.</p>\n<p><strong>To be implemented:</strong></p>\n<p>- missiles<br/>- a better HUD<br/>- waypoints and airports that allow reloading<br/>- game goals and game modes<br/>- a proper UI<br/>- more airplanes<br/>- ships and aircraft carrier</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>\n<p>- basic flotation<br/>- basic collisions<br/>- dummy missiles<br/>- visual radio static based on distance from airport<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3eb/3eb1758dba93c428392c004a84852558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Denis Labrecque"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
