You play as me trying to get to the end without giving in to those thoughts.\u00a0<em>Just Another Day</em> is a game with only one mechanic, you\u00a0<strong>jump with space,\u00a0</strong>and the goal is to reach the end of the level.</p>\n<p>I don't know why but the sound is a bit off in the web version. Also, the close button is for the downloadable.</p>\n<p>A bit of history about this game:</p>\n<p>These last few weeks I've been a bit more down than usual, and then this last week end the One Mechanic Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/omgjam5) happened. I didn't do it because I didn't want to make any games and I didn't want to do anything at all. But once wednesday came I felt even worse for not trying and losing that opportunity. So I made this game.\u00a0I don't know if this game is on theme with the jam, it could be evolution, but who knows. I just thought that for a one mechanic game this idea might work, and that's what mattered for me.</p>\n<p>Because I tried to make it \"like a jam\" I put myself a time limit and a no help from outside limit. I started making the game wednesday morning and I've just finished, friday night. I had class during wednesday, thursday and friday afternoon, so it wasn't actually three days, but also it wasn't two days, so whatever.</p>\n<p>The big limit is that I had to made all the assets myself (except the font). I've never done sprites or music before, so it was quite a challenge, and it didn't turn out\u00a0<em>horrible,</em> I think?</p>\n\n<p>The font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/es/vcr-osd-mono.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/071/071df130b9c370f78424408f35040839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Red Scoresby"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
