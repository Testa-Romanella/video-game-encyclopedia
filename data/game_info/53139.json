{"id": 53139, "slug": "tempest-1981", "name": "Tempest (1981)", "name_original": "Tempest (1981)", "description": "<p>Tempest is a 1981 arcade game by Atari Inc., designed and programmed by Dave Theurer. It takes place on a three-dimensional surface, sometimes wrapped into a tube, which is viewed from one end and is divided into a dozen or more segments or lanes. The player controls a claw-shaped spaceship (named Blaster) that crawls along the near edge of the playfield, moving from segment to segment.</p>\n<p>Tempest was one of the first games to use Atari's Color-QuadraScan vector display technology. It was also the first game to allow the player to choose their starting level (a system Atari dubbed \"SkillStep\"). This feature increases the maximum starting level depending on the player's performance in the previous game, essentially allowing the player to continue. Tempest was one of the first video games to sport a progressive level design in which the levels themselves varied rather than giving the player the same layout with increasing difficulty levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/4736b873c98759e4420f0bf3c23257bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 9, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Atari"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
