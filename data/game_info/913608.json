I knew I had to help it find its way out. My heart quivered as I approached, bracing myself for whatever surprises were bound to be encountered. Yet, when our eyes met, an instant bond was forged between us; one that could not be easily severed nor forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>I instantly knew that I needed to help it!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Meet Bones - a tiny, glowing, crystal-loving creature! They love nothing more than collecting rare and valuable crystals from all around the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When it comes to moving around their environment, they rely on pressing <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong>.
