Nervously, you fumble at a door handle only to find that it is paper thin. In fact, everything feels unnaturally thin and dry to the touch. Are you dreaming? Suddenly, you hear heavy footsteps. Feeling an inexplicable sense of dread, you frantically sprint away and race around a corner. As you try to catch your breath, you can't help but notice a scrap of paper with a single letter printed on it. The sight of the letter gives you a sudden sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. And slowly, you begin to remember how you got here. Maybe you can solve the mystery of this place and escape.</p>\n<p>If you get scared, don't worry; there's a dedicated button for screaming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bba24868dfeb5cb643ebb77eda039306.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simon Kaley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
