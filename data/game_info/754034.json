JAMGame is my 3rd entry to the 11th edition (2022) of the BASIC 10 Liner Contest. Although some memory games had already been submitted to the past editions of the contest, there was no 10-statements version I was aware of, so I coded it ;-)</p>\n<p>JAMGame is a single-player memory game. A round in the game consists of the computer showing a sequence of pseudorandom numbers in the range between 1 and 4, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the corresponding keys, followed by Enter. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. The initial length of the sequence is 3. If the player types the wrong sequence, the game is over and the program must be RUN again for another play. Two alternating graphics characters help distinguishing the single digits of the sequence to reproduce. When the sequence presented by the computer is over, the \u2591 character is displayed near the last digit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7892d3245142de0a809e2a31131c8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marco's retrobits"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
