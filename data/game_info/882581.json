You can control left and right movement by pressing the A and D keys. You can control the firing force by long pressing the left mouse button. Finally, move the mouse to select a good angle to shoot the ball. The ball keeps bouncing around the scene. If the ball hits the green circular finish within seven seconds, you win, otherwise you lose a life and take the next shot. If you hit the bright cross, you will gain an extra life, and the upper left corner of the screen will display your life count.
