My giftee told me they liked strange experimental games, and that's a scene a really vibe with. And boom, now you have this!<br/><br/>it's kinda unfinished, but it's a game in which you run around an office, just talking to your new co-workers as the brand new janitor.<br/><br/>What kind of strange people will you encounter?<br/>What will you be forced to do?<br/>Find out, wont you?<br/><br/><strong><em>CONTROLS<br/><br/></em></strong>W-A-S-D to move<br/>E to interact<br/>yeah that's it<br/><br/><strong><em>PLEASE READ<br/><br/></em></strong>Like I said earlier, this current build is VERY unfinished. It was for a jam, after all. On top of that, my life got very complicated in the middle of the development process.\u00a0I hope to pick it back up in the future and polish it, adding dialogue, quests, sidequests, etc.<br/><br/>Maybe even a world outside the office? I dunno. Just keep that in mind while you play. That being said, I hope you find some enjoyment out of it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:08:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/288/288bf6ca9108bff5090e72215b1589e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scrumbogames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
