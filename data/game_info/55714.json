It is the second instalment released in the Wipeout series, and is the direct sequel of the original game released the previous year. It was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and in 1997 for the Sega Saturn. It was later ported by Digital Images to the Amiga in 1999 and by Coderus to Mac OS in 2002.</p>\n<p>Whereas the original game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game introduced a new damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D Control Pad, whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.</p>\n<p>The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game for its dramatic improvements to the controls, graphics, and gameplay of the original Wipeout. IGN ranked the game as the 13th best PlayStation game of all time in 2002.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46efca9f53c940d9a3f4c505aed47dce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 12, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA Saturn", "PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["SCE Studio Liverpool", "Psygnosis"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis"], "esrb_rating": null}
