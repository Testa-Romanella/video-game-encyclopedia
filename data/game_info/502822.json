In order to avoid getting touched, you can press on a ball with your mouse click to make it disappear.\u00a0Note that the screen will flash red when a ball gets close to you. Use this to your advantage and start looking around when the screen becomes red!</p><p>IMPORTANT TIP:<br/>When the game begins, click on the pointer in the middle of the screen to properly adjust your aim (WebGL is annoying).\u00a0</p><p>Songs from bensound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7ef2bb5c0387229c2ebdef49a03f256f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Philip Park"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
