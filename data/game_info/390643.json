Hearing of this discovery, forces of both light and dark have come to your doorstep, seeking to steal your power and blight you out. Harnessing the souls of your fallen enemies, you will transfigure your tower lair into a gauntlet of death-traps in order to halt their approach.</p>\n<p>The catch is this: every obstacle you place is player-activated. That means there's no relying on automatic turrets to protect you this time around! Instead, survival is entirely dependent on your knack for timing and ability to manage multiple floors at once.</p>\n<p>There are 15 rounds in total. Will you survive the onslaught and keep hold of your dominion?</p>\n<p>~~~FEEDBACK SURVEY~~~<br/>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfg1krmd3ssnLexgdOnRvGTi1bHtkOnw_KAAIC0...</p>\n<p>~~CREDITS~~<br/>Director/Asst.
