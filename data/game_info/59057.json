The game mechanics, the match pacing, and the online server performance are all tuned to provide the cleanest, rawest, most visceral competition on the planet. It&#39;s everything you need and nothing you don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>In 2016, The Culling emerged as the world&#39;s first built-from-scratch Battle Royale experience. Featuring a lush island arena, brutal melee combat, and a long list of perks to help you define your play style, The Culling offered the most intense experience many contestants had ever experienced.</p>\n<p>The Culling 2 expands on every aspect of its predecessor: The arena is now a massive space, with 20 square kilometers in which to explore, loot, and fight. In addition to the established melee combat system, a wide range of firearms are now on offer, from 9mm pistols to high-caliber sniper rifles. All ballistics have been carefully tuned to match real-world equivalents, making for tense and tactical firefights. With 50 players, the matches are set to be fast and brutal, while still accommodating players who prefer a more cautious approach.</p>\n<p>If you think you have what it takes, it&#39;s time to suit up and compete in the next season of the original deadly game show: The Culling 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-23T14:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4a5/4a5d2ff1f79634632eb3fe29f18a9558.jpg", "website": "https://www.theculling2.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 61, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 391, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Xaviant", "Xaviant L.L.C."], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xaviant Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
