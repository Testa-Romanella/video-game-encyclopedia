Try and shoot the ball into the goal in one try to beat each level, but make sure to pay attention to the color of the floor. Blue tiles will rotate the level clockwise, and pink tiles will rotate the tiles counterclockwise.\u00a0 Oh, did I mention there's gravity too?</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:\u00a0</strong>Click and drag on the ball to aim your shot. The further from the ball you drag, the farther your shot will go. Get the ball in the goal in one try and you complete the level! Try and beat all 12!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a0Kenney 2021 Game Jam. The theme was \"Rotation\" and was made in one weekend.</p>\n<p>There is also a Windows build to download below if you prefer that over the web player.</p>\n<p><strong>Known\u00a0Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes when you reach the goal, the ball zooms off into oblivion. I still have no clue why this happens because it does not happen in the Unity editor.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:12:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a0/6a02362768e3268141ff2bc44cc3aa9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Saculrotsen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
