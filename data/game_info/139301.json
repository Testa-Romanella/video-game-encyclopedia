Its far from complete, but it is a good start to a much larger concept.</p><p>In later version you will be able to launch devistating attacks using special ablities that each ship posesses as well as the ability to play online with friends. Neither of these are availble in this version.</p><p>There is also a bug in how the grid layers some of the effects. I have an idea for a fix but time wasn't on my side.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e210549e927857ca28c5907799a48c06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["Vague Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
