To escape you need to repair the escape pod by collecting all the missing parts. The problem is that there are dozens of maintenance robots called H0P3 units. They are realy happy that you woke up so they follow you and try to hug you but if they do, they slow you down and you wont be able to repair the pod in time.</p><p>Team:</p><p><strong>Andreas Monitzer </strong>gamejam@monitzer.com</p><p><strong>Jakob Lindner </strong>jakob123lindner@gmail.com<br/></p><p><strong>Laurenz Br\u00fcnner </strong>laurenz.bruenner@hotmail.com</p><p><strong>Simon Dimitriadis </strong>simon.dimitriadis@gmx.at</p><p><strong>Zolt\u00e1n Kurucz </strong>kurucz.zoltan87@gmail.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/65638f2a479e937179dd0436da435adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JakNak72"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
