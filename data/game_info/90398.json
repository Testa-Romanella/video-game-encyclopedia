But now famous model Christian Marino finds himself at a crossroads. What will he do with his life once his well-known and much-cherished looks fade? Is there even anything more to him below the surface that everyone else sees? As he considers these issues of future and identity, he's suddenly cast as the lead role in a film based on a bestselling novel. With fresh new challenges to face in an unfamiliar environment, this just might be the solution Christian was looking for\u2014to more problems than one.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main theme for this game is \t<strong>crossroads</strong>. Rather than having \"good\" and \"bad\" endings, each love interest has a friendship ending as well as romantic \"A\" and \"B\" endings. Neither romantic ending is meant to be better than the other.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C H A R A C T E R S</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Christian Marino (25):</strong> The protagonist and a famous model who's acting in a movie for the first time. Despite his star status, Christian's quite level-headed and down-to-earth. He possesses something of a dry wit and is very much aware of his good looks. He isn't vain, but his confidence can come across that way and his peers sometimes complain that he ought to be more humble.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Oliver Wong (23):</strong> An up-and-coming novelist whose recent bestseller is being turned into the movie that Christian and Rainier have been picked to star in. He also wrote the screenplay, so he's constantly on set. A suave type who is very articulate and used to people fawning over him, Oliver's tactics don't work on Christian which is a source of confusion and frustration for him.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Rainier Laurent (28):</strong> A perfectionistic and hardworking actor. Up until now, he's always been cast in supporting roles and told that he isn't leading man material. Though generally a friendly guy, Rainier looks down upon Christian for being a model and relying on his looks/connections to get ahead and is unfortunately quite nasty to him. (his name is pronounced REN-yay)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sacha Laurent (30):</strong> The CEO of a restaurant chain that grew from a single restaurant that she opened. She caters for the film staff and is also currently in Milan on business. Sacha is Rainier's older sister but isn't at all in touch with pop/celebrity culture. Bright and driven, she gets excited when discussing the culinary arts or eating delicious food.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viola Ferrara (26):</strong> A skilled stylist and make-up artist. Viola is Christian's personal stylist and closest friend. She was once also a famous model, but left the spotlight just before coming out as transgender. A kind person, she's nonetheless a little jaded because of her experiences and will not hesitate to kick someone's butt if they're being ridiculous.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e49b0e0733ceae79f16aa05b3be0c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cyanide Tea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
