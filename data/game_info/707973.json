No new features are included and this is just a bug fixes:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Added backgrounds to the titles for the sliders</li><li>\u00a0Changed the size of the toggle box for Timed Destroy AND turned it off by default</li><li>\u00a0Fixed Squidward's name in the dropdown menu (removed Tentacles from name)</li><li>\u00a0Added the ability to change \"Animation\u00a0State\" with keypad/numpad as it originally only worked with the alphanumeric numbers at the top of the keyboard</li><li>\u00a0Internal Fix: Moved the cube, sphere, and cylinder objects into empty objects inside their prefabs to simplify background code (so both the non-fancy objects (cube, sphere, and cylinder) and fancy objects (Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward prefabs) can use the same methods for changeAnimationState and stopAnimation instead of having two separate methods per non-fancy and fancy objects.</li><li>Internal Fix: By default now, the \"Animation\u00a0State\" and \"Animation\u00a0OFF:\" now show their default settings when the game starts (which they previously didn't).</li></ol>\n\n<p>SCROLL FURTHER TO READ OLD DESCRIPTIONS<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>OLD features from Project #3</p>\n<ol><li>Pressing 0

Squidward) is selected, the image on the second menu panel will be a checkmark over the 3 sprites of the prefab's faces.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>If a primitive (cube, sphere, or cylinder) is selected, the
