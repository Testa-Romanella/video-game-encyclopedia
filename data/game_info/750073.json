What the heck is that? ZZT is a thirty-year-old game-making tool. Weave is a tool for modding and extending ZZT.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW DO I PLAY? </strong>Use the arrow keys! Bump into things to interact with them. Other mechanics will be explained as you go. Press the H key in-game for more help.</p>\n<p><strong>TONE AND CONTENT.\u00a0</strong>The tone of this game is inspired by queer\u00a0YA fiction, teen horror movies like the\u00a0Fear Street trilogy, and Scooby Doo. There\u00a0is some psychological horror, but most of\u00a0the game could be described as \"goofy.\"</p>\n<strong>CONTENT WARNINGS (Contains spoilers)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A closeted queer teen wrestles with her crush on another girl.</li>\n<li>Brief mention of an alcoholic parent.</li>\n<li>A malicious doppleganger threatens the protagonist.</li>\n<br/>\n<p>You can find a full story synopsis by pressing H in-game and selecting \"content warnings.\"</p>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>DOWNLOADING THE GAME.\u00a0</strong>You can download the game below, but note that you can't run it in vanilla ZZT.
