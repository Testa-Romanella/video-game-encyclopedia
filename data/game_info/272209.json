(itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>The game is a hybrid of Tower Defense and Card Game - you need to defend from endless waves of monsters wanting your demise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>1. You can <strong>place towers</strong> by\u00a0 selecting <strong>a blue card </strong>and then selecting empty tower slot or replacing existing one.</p>\n<p>2. You can <strong>upgrade towers </strong>with a <strong>purple card</strong> by selecting a card on hand and then selecting tower.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 <strong>Blue tower cards</strong> are <strong>one-use</strong>, <strong>green and purple</strong> go to the <strong>graveyard</strong> and reshuffled when deck is empty.</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 <strong>Green Skill cards</strong> (heart) are used by simply clicking them.<br/></p>\n<p>5. You can<strong> draw a card </strong>by clicking on the deck in the top left corner, drawing a card also sends <strong>another wave</strong> so be\u00a0careful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comments from the authors:</strong></p>\n<p>The game was meant to be bigger and have custom\u00a0 made levels, but in the end most of the development took place a day before submission :) because of that the game lacks balance and sounds, but we managed to implement the mechanics from both Tower Defense and Card Game genres. There are some known issues with animations, for which we used DragonBonesPro and its runtime.</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy exploring the idea, have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac7/ac79979f8f2489309a8eb4a3a5179555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bartosz.mazur90", "DartMicha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
