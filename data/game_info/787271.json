It was my first game and it took me more than 2 years to <strong>Solo Develop</strong> it with the moral support of my friends Stringsy, El Derpo, CalHob, MrYossarian and the Guys at the Land of Strings Discord Server (Big shout out to them right here).\u00a0I had almost no experience with Unity Engine and the budget was less than 3 dollars (Thanks to the only <strong>Patro</strong>n at that time: Grento, for that contribution). However I kept going despite the unfavorable odds and finished Cupcakey Party as it is right now. The game had a favorable reception over the Youtube community and had million of views at the time\u00a0(Not that the actual game had a lot of downloads despite of being a free game and still I didn't earned anything from that game).</p>\n<p>After that I tried to pave the way for mobile development builds so I\u00a0\u00a0released an early prototype game:\u00a0Pinkamena - The Dungeon. Unfortunately Google took that game down because of Pinkie Pie being in a\u00a0violent scenario (There wasn't that much violence in that game just Pinkie Pie chasing the player\u00a0with a knife but parents complained anyway). In order to keep all the hard work invested into that game I had to replace Pinkie Pie with my Original Character: Witchmare, the evil entity that lurks in a dimension of my Verses\u00a0similiar the backrooms that exists in between dreams and reality.\u00a0I added 3 more dungeons and called that game finished and now I'm releasing the game for PC with\u00a0High Quality Textures and Lighting for you.</p>\n\n<p>So If you like my work I really encourage you to buy this game so I can keep making more games of my own.</p>\n<p>Eight Blackey\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>=\\ ^((8))^ /=</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/365/3653b1195bfecbac5005d1c58326626e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EightBlackey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
