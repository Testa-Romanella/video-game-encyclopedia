{"id": 374236, "slug": "barbarock", "name": "BARBAROCK", "name_original": "BARBAROCK", "description": "<p>Long, long, looooooong time ago things were simple, as simple as a rock. Boulders, menhirs, monoliths and even handfuls of pebbles were the bread and butter of simple people (way before the invention of bread or butter). Humans lived and died by the rock, as went the old saying \"Rock to rock, rubble to rubble\".<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BARBAROCK</strong> is a faithful reenactment of how minor disputes and quarrels were solved during those rough times (guts and screams of agony included!). So, grab a friend, pick up those controllers and learn some damn history!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO ROCK - MASTERING GUIDE:</strong></p>\n<p>The rock must become the extension of your body; you must be one with the boulder! Splendid rolls and glorious dashes are difficult to handle, but after the initial learning phase they should become easy to master. How to go through this process as smoothly as possible?</p>\n<ol><li>Don't move. Start with the \"Dive Kick\" technique: jump [x], rotate to aim the rock at your opponent's head [L1/R1 or \u25a1/\u25cb], then dash [x] to smash his skull to little pieces.</li><li>Start rolling [left analog stick] to evade your foe and to position yourself for better aimed attacks. Remember: you can gain the highest acceleration if you stay perpendicular to the ground. Ground? Ha! If you use this technique you can roll your rock anywhere; even on the wall and on the ceiling!\u00a0</li><li>Try dodging your opponent's attacks. While being attacked, rotate so that your body lies parallel to the ground. This way your head will be safe and your opponent will most probably hit your rock instead.</li><li>Do what you can to get a hang of the mid-air rotation. While jumping, rotate constantly [hold L/R or \u25a1/\u25cb] and estimate your safe landings. This can be tricky on some of the arenas, but after a dozen or so unfortunate landings you should be able to precisely control your rock and body.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/8846df682c8cdfd50e51237c900c7169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sabikku"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
