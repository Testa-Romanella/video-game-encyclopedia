Try to decide which way the ball rotated then align the planets to hit it. So pretty much pong with a twist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the way, I know the music is terrible because I made this game in 2.5 hours so I just decided to mess with your head with it. And also this was made by an eleven year old.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:27:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b30/b30243f9dfd55187a9305396e58ed799.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Highway Studios"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
