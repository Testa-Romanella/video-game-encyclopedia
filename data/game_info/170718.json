This game is free to play and the second one will be too, but you are free to donate money if you like. All the money will be used towards the development of more games. <br/></strong></p>\n<p>Version 0.4: I have fixed some bugs, and added more interaction with more stuff.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5: Have completely changed the shop prices, and have fixed the bug with the missing animations.
