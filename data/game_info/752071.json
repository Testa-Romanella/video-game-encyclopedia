Each player can also create/record a unique story featuring the lady avatar in this virtual world.<h3>1. Creation of a 3D Lover</h3>Players will first be taken to a virtual blue ocean called \u201cSea of Eva.\u201d Here, the players will need to create a virtual 3D lady avatar, who will be created here can be highly realistic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Creating the lady avatar\u2019s face for the first time is very simple. The player just needs to select from thousands of AI photos. All of them are over 18.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Then, after creating a very realistic face via our AI technology, the player needs to create the lady\u2019s hairstyle, and choose her hair color.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Next, the system will generate a body for the lady avatar.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Not in the dress preferred by the player? No worries, each player can choose clothes for the 3D lady avatar.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Throughout the game, players can unlock more and more clothes by completing game tasks. The more tasks done, the more beautiful clothes can be collected for the lady avatar.<h3>2. Artificial soul of the 3D lover as well as AI chatting accompany system</h3>Of course, in our opinion, the body alone is not enough to create a perfect 3D lover.<br/>The most interesting part of this game is that the created lady avatar can also have her personality and temperament. The personality created will affect the lady avatar\u2019s attitude, speech, and action toward the player as well as her interactions with the player.<br/><br/>The player can also give the virtual lady avatar a unique name, birthday, and personality, which can somewhat affect her speaking and behavioral habits. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Okay, now let\u2019s try to interact with the lady avatar. She will understand and reply.<br/>(Type in words here, or speak with a microphone.)<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>Moreover, as the player\u2019s interaction with the avatar is strengthened, her favorability system will also be affected.<h3>3. Virtual dating system</h3>Thus, the next step is to allow this newborn virtual lady avatar to date.<br/><br/>Players can also create a virtual home within the game. Unlike other games, the homes here look very realistic. Take a look at this example of a virtual home.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/>In the virtual home, the game will arrange different interesting tasks. Once a player completes the task, awards can be gained (e.g., deeper favorability from the avatar), and more contents can be unlocked.<h3>4. Dancing with her!</h3><br/> <br/> <br/><br/>This game provides users with interesting music dance gameplay.<br/>In the concert gameplay, we have a lot of rhythmic dances.<br/>Users can play different music by following beat timings and tapping keys.<h3>5. Desktop MMD Mode</h3><br/><h3>6. Brand new recording system</h3><br/>The recording system allows players to plan, rehearse, and record all happy fantasies he would like to experience in the virtual game, just like a movie director.<br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>This is the operation button guide for this game.<br/><br/><h3>End notes</h3>In a science fiction novel entitled \u201cLight of Other Days,\u201d Bob Shaw imagined a kind of \u201cslow glass,\u201d which allows people to capture a picturesque scenery that they can later enjoy in their homes or workplaces, and shared a beautiful and moving story.<br/><br/>My father often talked about \u201cslow glass.\u201d He said if it were in your windows, you could look out on your lawn and see something that happened in that same spot in the past. The outside of this window seems to show the beauty of the past. Birds fly in the sky, day and night alternate, and seasons change. A woman, her dress dazzlingly dazzling, she stood at the window for a few seconds, and then smiles.<br/><br/>With this game, I would like to pay tribute to my deceased ex-girlfriend, Jessica, who died five years ago. My love for her is so deep, and even up to this day, I feel that everything in my life still has her traces. I miss her very much, so I have been thinking about developing such a game/program for several years now. This game serves as a \u201cslow glass\u201d through which we can re-capture and experience special moments with our loved ones.<br/><br/>The beautiful woman is still there, as if she is still in full bloom only yesterday. Only the falling raindrops seem to tell the truth behind the withering flower.<br/><br/>I hope that this game, just like Bob Shaw\u2019s \u201cslow glass,\u201d can comfort the hearts of people like me throughout the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e372ce8a58d611a3466307eee1087eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William at Oxford"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["William at Oxford"], "esrb_rating": null}
