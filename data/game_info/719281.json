After the two men along a few others go missing and the factory is rumored to be cursed, the factory closes for a while... until it's reopened. But underneath it all, there might be something much bigger hiding underneath.\u00a0\r\nThis is built from scratch by me, with edited pictures from Google and models from Brawl Box (SSBB hacking tool).\u00a0\r\nHope you like it! Big thanks to Scott Cawthton for making such an excelent franchise!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T08:11:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b844eb9efbe29ad937fc84f71040447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WwwWario"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
