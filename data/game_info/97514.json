Its gameplay combines puzzle solving and filling your characters needs. You have to avoid illnesses and stay healthy, while trying to find out who or what killed Larry Harper.<br/></p><p>The game starts when detective John Foley gets fired from his job due to his incompetence and lack of mental stability. Following his employers will, John takes a vocation in a small town of Pine Lake. Secretly he's planing to start his own investigations, on a suspicious case of death, which recently occurred at the same hotel he's planing to stay in. In no time he finds him self stranded in the empty Pinelake Inn.</p><p>Fatigue strongly relies on atmosphere and aims to tell a story about dependence on others, decaying trust, and paranoia.</p><p>The project is currently on hold but I hope I'll be able to get back to it at some point. For the meantime here is a little demo that shows a little bit of the direction in which the project is heading.</p><p><strong><strong>Update 23.10.2016 New control scheme. Some interaction issues fixed. Inventory system modified.</strong></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f704d0c4a2c26becf4b2a73c0cbe08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jolkio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
