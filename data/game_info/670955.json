The music and visuals aim to represent\u00a0the mental and physical\u00a0space that Dolorosa was\u00a0confined to during that time.</p>\n<p>This is an atmospheric experience that only asks you to move\u00a0within the environment and to proceed through the different rooms and sounds, back and forth, round and round, spiraling out of control.</p>\n<p><em>There is no objective other than finding your way.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Headphones or stereo speakers recommended. WASD+Mouse controls.<br/></p>\n<p>In the download package you\u00a0will receive a Win and Mac version of the application as well as\u00a0the full soundtrack as .wav files. <br/></p>\n<p>If you are not sure about whether you want to download, please check out the free browser version first. In the browser version, frame rate is lower and spatial sound features are restricted by the Unity WebGL capabilities.</p>\n<p>By paying for this standalone version you support my ongoing work in the fields of art, music and experimental game development. Thank you &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:23:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/263/263379ca20fe10e0371d80d8cec77af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dolorosa.xyz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
