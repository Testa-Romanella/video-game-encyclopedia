Bullets change colour when they bounce; if enemies are hit with a red bullet they die but if they're hit with a green bullet, they multiply. The more enemies there are on the screen, the more points you earn when killing one.</p><p>I'm trying to decide between two different movement modes so both are included. </p><p>Instructions in-game.</p><p>KNOWN BUGS:</p><p>- You (and enemies) can fly right through the walls in game mode A, so watch out for that</p><p>- For some reason, you can only select objects by clicking to the left of them. This doesn't happen when i run it on the PC I used for development and I'm still trying to figure it out</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a67125e39480d32e3f7b0828e8efd19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OniNinja"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
