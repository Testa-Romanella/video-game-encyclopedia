The production line is in overdrive, and your job - painting the insignias on each propeller - is as important as any else. Slot the correct filter modules into the painting arms\u00a0to make sure each propeller bears the correct patterns. Do be mindful that due to time constraints, we'll have to test the rotation on these parts while you're painting them, so make sure they come out the right way around.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Drag the filters onto the sockets to control the design that is painted onto each blade. Some filters will cycle between different colors and shapes.</li><li>Press the button once the filters are configured to paint the propeller. Try to match the design shown on the screen.</li><li>Complete as many propellers as you can before time runs out!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T09:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa49fb97e3e3aaf5f1d06df9cb90fbe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikroscopic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
