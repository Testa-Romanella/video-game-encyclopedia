About 75% of\u00a0the planned content didn't make it into this build. This was actually suppose to be a \"rhythm\" bullet hell game, but I\u00a0wasn't really satisfied with how the mechanic was working, so I\u00a0scraped it near the end of finishing the jam build. I'm a bit disappointed I\u00a0wasn't able to get all the cool stuff in the game before I\u00a0ran out of time. That's why I've decided to continue working on the game after the jam has ended. I\u00a0have so many more ideas for this game, I\u00a0hope you'll come back to check it out :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T19:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/035/035a4b119651ff594f34f34ffe2e2bcb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wishing Rock"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
