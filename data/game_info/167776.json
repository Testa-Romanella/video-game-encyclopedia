For Ludum Dare #35 (shapeshifting), we put our engine to the test and built h3ss: shape shifting in hyperbolic 3-space. Since then we have been continuing work and have a new build for the Intel Level Up gamedev contest.</p><p>Push and pull the icosahedra around the space to cover all sockets and special configurations that will allow the 'life-like' update rules to wipe out the remaining cells. An 'off' cell with three neighbours will become 'on' and an 'on' cell with three or more neighbours will become 'off'.</p><p>Please checkout our website wboqm.com, sign up for our mailing list there or just follow us on twitter @wboqm.<br/></p><p>By popular request, a walkthrough (for LD35 build) is available here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2a/e2a03959fd47b571713f4e1f9c7655da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["wboqm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
