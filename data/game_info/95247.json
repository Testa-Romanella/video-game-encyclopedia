Champions arrived with powerful weapons, magickal artefacts, chosen prophets, powerful charms, big axes, tiny time prisms, a dragon companion, even working close enough to Lord Chaos so as to betray them - they all failed.<br/>For years after, there was nothing but desolation as the kingdom collapsed and the people and beasts disbanded into tribes.</p>\n<p>You are Theron, student to the departed Grey Lord. At the time of the cataclysm, the Grey Lord protected your soul, even though he could not save your body. Only now has he been able to approach you and offer you the power to embark on an epic quest.<br/>Granted with the power to raise four lost champions, your assembled team must find the fabled Firestaff deep inside the Dungeons of Mount Anaias to defeat Lord Chaos. On the way, you will learn as much of the Champions as you will of the Dungeon Master.</p>\n<p><strong>Seek balance. Bring the world back to life.
