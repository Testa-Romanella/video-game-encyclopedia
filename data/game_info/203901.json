It's based on the physics tutorial included with Fusion. I added a few elements, namely my own (bad) art, a score tracker, and a win state.</p><p>You could actually call it a game. You *could*.</p><p>I (quite obviously) have next to zero programming experience. That said, I'm pretty happy I managed to create this over lunch. Highly recommended tool for people that want to make some games but don't know where to start.</p><p>Oh, and don't click outside the game window. It will freeze. The only way to restart if that happens is to refresh.
