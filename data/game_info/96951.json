Blow your didgeridoo in time with the drums to hit your opponent or play alone for meditative practice.</p>Didgeri...do?<p>\r\n\tLegend says that this way of the didgeridoo way founded by a komusou monk from Japan, an escaped capoeirista from Brazil, and an iconoclastic dreamer from Australia. A form of solo meditation. A way to practice deadly didgeridoo moves disguised as an improvised, playful dance. A new way to see and experience other dimensions without technology or drugs. Didgerido is all of these, and more.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tBut devoting your life to didgerido is a big decision. This game gives you a taste of what walking that path would feel like, either in quiet solitude with headphones or with a friend also considering the path over speakers. Use a shift key to enter a command pattern with the beat. Compete to the first touch of your didgeridoo upon your partner, or leave the mat to complete your session. Listen to the drum for guidance.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnd should you find that digerido speaks to you, please consider giving alms to support future work. Blow in peace, friend.\r\n</p>\r\nPatterns\r\n<p>\r\n\to indicates starting to blow; . indicates additional beats. Press your shift key on a beat to start blowing.

Then line up the middle two so it looks like you have three fingers. Keep that focus and look at the screen.
