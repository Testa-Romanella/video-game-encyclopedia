Be on the look out for customers that remove their mask inside the store. If a customer is not wearing a mask and coughs they will leave behind a cloud that you'll need to sanitize with the spray. Also look out for Karens. It is impossible to place a mask on a Karen so you'll have to hit her with the spray to get her to leave. As the day goes on the Rona meter will increase depending on if there are infected customers with no masks on in the store. Do your best to keep this out of control virus under control or else this mom and pop shop will be shutdown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:01:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184d4ce6076fa5422c68eb4f1b1c85e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luis Garcia Remes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
