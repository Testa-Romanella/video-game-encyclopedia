Please note that save files will not work if you play on mobile !<br/></strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p>For Windows, I recommend using Notepad++. This is what I use for my own save files<br/></p>\n<p>The pause menu can be brought up by holding the pause button, where there will be an option to save. Alternatively, on the web player version above, you can click the pause button to the right of the game.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When saving, the player, then the world will be copied to the clipboard. Paste these into an empty text file each to save them! If you're overwriting an existing file, make sure it is completely empty  first. (for example, in most text editors you would press ctrl+a to select all, then backspace to delete the old save, then ctrl+v to paste the new one, then save it with ctrl+s)</li>\n<li>When loading, simply drag and drop each file onto Terra when it asks and it will load them for you. Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the file and paste them onto the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a video for a visual demonstration:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Using tline sprite rotation function from TheRoboZ and distance function from freds72.</li>\n<li>Music by jo560hs.</li>\n<li>Sup3rAw3som3Gam3r helped with multiple ideas and a few optimisations.</li>\n<li>Everyone who has played and found bugs for me to fix!</li>\n</ul>\nFull Playthrough (1.4.2 dev)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T10:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d25f7c907e304ab5fe3a4c859da3fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cubee"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
