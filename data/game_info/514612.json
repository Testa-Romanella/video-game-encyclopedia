He didn't bear any royalty bloodline at all,\u00a0 but due to his dedication in military &amp; loyalty to the kingdom, he became King Roger's most trusted knight. King Roger was King of the Kingdom of Francia at that time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The earth had three ruling kingdoms.\u00a0 There were Kingdom of Francia which ruled the northern part of earth,\u00a0 Kingdom of Burgee which ruled the eastern part of earth, and Duchy of Halsuis which ruled the southern part of earth. Those three kingdoms<br/>cooperated together to maintain order &amp; peace in the earth.\u00a0 However, those centuries of peace didnt last long until a Mysterious Dark Lord named Darkbringer<br/>and his dark forces arised from the underworld and wiped out the entire earth. Only several Kingdom of Francia remained which include Jean, King Roger, Princess Eris(Princess of Kingdom of Francia), several royalties, and several folks of Kingdom of Francia.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Depressed with this situation, King Roger decided to go to Temple of Chromus to find Chromus guidance/blesssing. Suddenly Chromus (The God of Light) appeared and gave King Robert a fraction of power from him which included The Sword of Light (which can kill dark force easily) and time-stopping ability (absorb several life from its user everytime it's casted). Chromus asked King Robert to protect Princess Eris at all cost,\u00a0 because Chromus sealed the power of Ragnarok inside the Eris. Ragnarok could be casted by Eris or Darkbringer, but the problem is Eris had to come to age in order to cast that power and if that power fell into the Darkbringer, the world would be destroyed by Darkbringer. On other hand, if that power casted by Eris together with \"Servant of Light\", it could destroy Darkbringer &amp; dark forces for good &amp; bring out the light on the world.\u00a0 King Roger accepted that responsibility &amp; power and became the \"servant of light\", humanity's last hope. Not long after, however, King Roger suddenly got ill, and bestowed his power, responsibility &amp; title to Jean, his most trusted knight before dying.\u00a0 To make thing worse, Princess Eris was missing.<br/></p>\n<p>Jean asked the informant the whereabout of Princess Eris, and it lead to \"Darkbringer's lair\". Raiding the lair alone and fueled by his sense of duty, he must save Princess Eris at all cost. The lair was filled with many dark force troops\u00a0 and trap. Can he save Princess Eris in time?</p>\n<p><strong>Control</strong><br/>Left-Right key: Move the character horizontally<br/>Down+Left/Right (In the ground): Slide<br/>Up key: Jump<br/>X: Melee attack<br/>(While in the air) Down key (hold) + X: Air slam attack<br/>C: Time stop ability<br/>Q: Use potion to heal</p>\n<p>Esc: Goto pause menu</p>\n<p><strong>Game Assets</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sprites</strong><br/>Magical Orb: https://opengameart.org/content/magic-orbs<br/><br/></p><p>Magic Circle: https://opengameart.org/content/teleporter-circle<br/><br/></p><p>Boss: https://opengameart.org/content/3-form-rpg-boss-harlequin-epicycle<br/><br/></p><p>Magical Beam: https://gamesupply.itch.io/massive-weapon-package<br/><br/></p><p>Arrow: https://opengameart.org/content/rotating-arrow-projectile<br/><br/></p><p>Main Character: https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero<br/><br/></p><p>Skeleton Enemy: https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack<br/><br/></p><p>Archer Enemy: https://szadiart.itch.io/hero-and-opponents-animation<br/><br/></p><p>HealthBar: https://opengameart.org/content/health-bar<br/><br/></p><p>Princess: https://opengameart.org/content/princess-yasuko-super-miyamoto-land\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Tileset</strong><br/>https://askariot.itch.io/game-tileset</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br/>https://opengameart.org/content/sewer-level-background</p>\n<p><strong>BGM</strong><br/>Clav Dungeon: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play4102.html by addpico<br/><br/></p><p>Heroic Verse(Main theme): https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play6617.html by Yoshihiro<br/><br/></p><p>Noble Execution(Cutscene theme): https://wingless-seraph.net/material/Battle-Noble.mp3<br/><br/></p><p>Demonic Rampage(Boss battle theme): https://wingless-seraph.net/material/Battle-Demonic.mp3<br/><br/></p><p>Reminiscence(Game over theme): https://wingless-seraph.net/material/reminiscence.mp3<br/><br/></p><p>Victory 1 (Win screen theme): https://wingless-seraph.net/material/jingle1.mp3</p>\n<p><strong>SFX</strong><br/>Player attack: https://wingless-seraph.net/sound/voice/07_jakigan_attack.wav<br/><br/></p><p>Player hurt: https://wingless-seraph.net/sound/voice/15_nekketsu_damage.wav<br/><br/></p><p>Player dead:\u00a0https://wingless-seraph.net/sound/voice/23_nekketsu_down.wav</p><p>Boss hurt: https://wingless-seraph.net/sound/voice/15_monster_damage.wav<br/><br/></p><p>Shoot arrow: http://soundbible.com/2108-Shoot-Arrow.html<br/><br/></p><p>Arrow land: http://soundbible.com/963-Arrow.html<br/><br/></p><p>Axe\u00a0swing: http://soundbible.com/1163-Battle-Axe-Swing.html</p><p>Alien machine gun(magical orb): http://soundbible.com/1802-Alien-Machine-Gun.html<br/><br/></p><p>Laser Cannon (magical beam):\u00a0http://soundbible.com/1771-Laser-Cannon.html</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.1001freefonts.com/arcade-classic.font</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/pix-pixelfjverdana12pt-font.html<br/></p>\n\n<p>The source code of this game can be seen\u00a0here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T08:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63ac6109e19db050f6b5820991604e75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["codefire53"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
