Momentum Mod centralizes and improves upon various community movement game types from various Source games. Play user-created maps, climb the ranked leaderboards, and become a master of each movement discipline.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Momentum Mod is a free, standalone game built on the Chaos Source Engine that aims to faithfully recreate, centralize, and improve upon the movement game modes found in Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Half-Life 2, Titanfall 2, and Quake. We aim to provide the best experience found from all of your favorite games and servers, all in one convenient place, all for free.</p>\n<p><strong>But it gets better!</strong></p>\n<p>With access to the native code of the Source Engine itself, favorite features from plugins and completely original features can be natively implemented and included with the base game. This means absolutely no extra requirements or dependencies needed; no server/plugin setup tutorials need be followed; it&#39;s all here when you click &quot;Install Game&quot;!</p>\n<p>Being a standalone game means we can optimize for the supported game modes, giving Momentum Mod a smoother, native feel and the subsequent performance of being a game made for them, compared to traditional multiplayer servers with network latency and hefty, high-level plugin code running all on top of the game itself.</p>\n<p>This is a game being built by Source movement fans, for Source movement fans! We are actively taking feedback from the community at large to develop a game that feels perfect, runs smoothly, and most importantly, is fun to play!</p>\n<h1>Some of Momentum Mod&#39;s confirmed features:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single-player client</strong> - no multiplayer game server connection required to play!  </li>\n<li><strong>Fully licensed Source Engine project</strong> - full compatibility with CS:GO/Portal 2 and TF2/CS:S maps, Portals, Panorama UI, and more!  </li>\n<li><strong>Client movement fixes</strong> - smooth gameplay with auto-jump, no ramp bugs, and consistent slope jump speeds built right into the client!  </li>\n<li><strong>Original entities</strong> - easier mapping and interesting new opportunities for all supported game modes!  </li>\n<li><strong>Global leaderboards, replays, and analytics</strong> - for every run you do, on every map submitted!  </li>\n<li><strong>Integrated map selector</strong> - easy map browsing and one-click downloads for maps, all from in-game!  </li>\n<li><strong>Hassle-free multiplayer</strong> - one-click multiplayer with Steam Lobbies, including cross-map chat!  </li>\n<li><strong>Community-driven development</strong> - public GitHub issue tracker, monthly Q&amp;A sessions, direct feedback in Discord!  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Some of Momentum Mod&#39;s planned features:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In-game tutorials</strong> - no more watching random YouTube videos to learn; learn through playing!  </li>\n<li><strong>Fully custom campaigns</strong> - designed to introduce complete newbies to the modes, story and speedrun modes included!  </li>\n<li><strong>Community-inspired dedicated servers</strong> - an experience many players are used to!  </li>\n<li><strong>Community-focused customization</strong> - a game-wide cosmetic shop with items unlocked purely through gameplay!  </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Gamemodes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Surf  </li>\n<li>Bunny Hop  </li>\n<li>Rocket Jump  </li>\n<li>Sticky Jump  </li>\n<li>Accelerated Hop  </li>\n<li>Tricksurf  </li>\n<li>Conc  </li>\n<li>Climb (KZ)  </li>\n<li>Parkour  </li>\n<li>Defrag</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-01-20T13:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04bf4d25747d06070c561ec5c4af8246.jpg", "website": "https://momentum-mod.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
