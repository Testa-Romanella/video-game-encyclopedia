Published by Activision in 1999, it is the first entry in the Tony Hawk&#39;s series of video games. Development began after Tony Hawk&#39;s debut stint at the 1998 X-Games.<br />\nPro Skater was released for the PlayStation on August 31, 1999, and was later ported to the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and N-Gage. It also received a Game Boy Color adaptation, and was released for Xbox in 2001 as part of the Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 2x collection. The game was met with critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its innovative gameplay, level designs and control scheme. It was also commercially successful, selling rapidly upon its opening month. The game resulted in a successful franchise, receiving eight annualized sequels developed by Neversoft from 2000&#39;s Pro Skater 2 to 2007&#39;s Proving Ground. In 2015, the licensing deal between Hawk and Activision expired after several failed attempts by developer Robomodo to revive the franchise.</p>", "metacritic": 92, "released": "1999-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T15:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd2/fd22fcd8470c96a6cf30051c3d249a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.41, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 61, "beaten": 121, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 52, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 122, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 124, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Game Boy Color", "Nintendo 64", "Dreamcast"], "developers": ["Neversoft"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
