But while fun, it's still a rage game...\r\n</p>\n<p>The entire idea of the game was to remove the issue of players who don't want to have to repeat the same sections of a game over and over again due to its difficulty. That's why the order of levels you play is different every time you die and there's plenty of content to be seen outside of the main ten levels.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, all that considered, it is still a rage game. I've tried my best to create a fun environment; but there's a big difference between <strong>playing</strong> a game and trying to beat it.</p>\n<p>The challenges that you will face on your journey.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ten levels, each with a collection of the worst tropes from across gaming history!
