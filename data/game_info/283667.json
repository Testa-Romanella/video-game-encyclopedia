Using WhiskerMidi (a.k.a CrazyRiverOtter at the time)'s old platformer engine, we set out to create something different from the usual Alex platformer game. Douglas did most of the level design, graphics, and character art. My influence consisted of much of the coding, game design, and the soundtrack. Both of us got sidetracked with other projects and lost interest in this, which is why this is just an incomplete demo of the first few levels.</p>\n<p>Niddle is an adventurer and resident of Little Island. It is a world of peace and abundance... at least until the evil Dr. Zeinlite emerges from his exile in the Shadow Zone. Zeinlite quickly raises an army of evil robots to fuel his ambitions to destroy literally everything. Niddle, being the only resident on the island, decides to stand his ground.</p>\n<p><strong>[Z]</strong> Jump <strong>[X]</strong> Run <strong>[A]</strong> Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cda9360c4ea80df6c30d7ce09ad9f968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["algamedev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
