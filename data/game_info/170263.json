Welcome to Gate traveler.</p>\n<p>This is game that was made the Let's Create Game Jam #1<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first project I have ever made using the Unreal engine 4 and also one of the first time actually using it. I had alot of fun learning the game engine and developing this game.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind: I entered the game jam 1 week before submission and at the start of school so I have been really busy. Something that I would have wanted is a better level design. I tried to be as creative as I could using the short time I had.</p>\n<p>I hope you like it tho!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3efe50b0bbb974c52f30413bb5248cd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sebbsubb"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
