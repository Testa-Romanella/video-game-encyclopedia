Don't touch anything that is red, all the red guys are bad guys and you should destroy them with your conveniently head-mounted cannon. You can't hit them? Try adjusting the projectiles velocity <em>while you are holding down the 'fire' button</em> by using the up/down arrow keys.</p>\n<p>You will be rewarded with extra points if you make awesome trick shots. Also if the debris from one shattered foe strikes another enemy, this too will inflict damage and give you bonus points.</p>\r\nHopper.\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tThis is a short little game that I made for LudumDare 38.
