Ultimately, this demo is designed to show some of the\u00a0potential of what is possible within\u00a0the \u201chybrid-RPG\u201d\u00a0as a potential genre/interactive fiction\u00a0game design formalism.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS?</strong></p>\n<p>I was trying to crack how to do a one-player tabletop RPG, and ended up\u00a0utilizing an automated GM via software (along with a TTRPG-style game engine)\u00a0to provide friction, consequence,\u00a0and choice.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU DO IN A HYBRID-RPG?</strong></p>\n<p>Playing as a character already saddled with history within the world of the\u00a0game, you\u2019ll build their personality in a character\u00a0sheet\u00a0and roll die (1d6 required for play) to determine the consequences of your actions during your\u00a0exploration of\u00a0an experience of your character\u2019s, as that character, as it occurs.<br/></p>\n<p>Test the facets of your BODY, MIND and WILL: A high <em>Applied Physicality\u00a0</em>skill will ensure you\u2019re always in control of your physical form, while points in the <em>Chaos</em> skill will enable you to more readily\u00a0feel and understand what lies beyond what most others can access. There are nine unique\u00a0skills to utilize when deciding on your character\u2019s personality,\u00a0which will be tested during the course of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>I WENT THROUGH THIS WEIRD THING, AND I\u2019D LIKE TO MAKE A HYBRID-RPG MYSELF. CAN I DO THAT?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Take whatever you need from these concepts, and throw out what you don\u2019t; ultimately,\u00a0this is a game-like\u00a0literary\u00a0platform- designed to be used, hopefully pushed forward\u00a0by those who do. Accreditation would be nice, but if you feel you\u2019ve done enough to modify the concepts presented to the point\u00a0that you don\u2019t feel it\u2019d make sense to redirect credit back here, I\u2019m no narc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T09:47:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78bd456d61cd752fe491b14e19b611a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["EsoteriSoft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
