They become beings of pure hatred that only wish for others to suffer the same fate they did.<br/><br/><strong>Only those who manage to understand them can free them.</strong><br/><br/>Remnant Records is a <strong>horror investigation game for 1 to 4 players</strong>, in which you are the newest recruit of an agency that deals with these paranormal matters.<br/>You will be sent to places that have been reported as haunted, and your job will be to cleanse them of undead presences with the help of your team.<br/><br/>To exorcise a spirit, you first have to understand it. Search the place and find the <strong>clues left behind</strong>: diaries, newspaper cuts, unusual objects. Understand the person this spirit was, and gather as many items that are closely related to it.<br/>Once you're ready, all you've got left to do is start the exorcism and pray you've understood everything correctly... and survive until the ghost is freed from this world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Procedural contracts</strong> that tell a new and fresh story to decipher with every mission.<br/></li><li><strong>Unique and terrifying ghosts</strong>, that differ vastly in both appearance and behaviors.
