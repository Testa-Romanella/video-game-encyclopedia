Use different tools to make the park look good and guests happy, clean the trash with a broom, repair broken equipment with a hammer, remove molehills with a shovel and scare off the vandals with your whistle. If a guest sees a piece of trash or a broken bench/trash can, his happiness falls down. At the end of the day, your park is rated and you can buy new upgrades with your earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong><br/></p><p><strong>If you experience misplacement of cursor</strong> in cleaning/repairing phase using web version <strong>please press ESC and then click where crosshair is</strong>.
