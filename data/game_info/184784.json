Your adventure will appens in a circular arena where which controls were slighty modified, but I say nothing more about that, I let you see that by yourself ;). The game will request you agility and dexterity to pass the most complexe tests that you could encounter by the eight levels availables made by Mathiouza. Why do I specify that it is me who have did these levels ? Quite simply because a level editor is incorporated in the game, but ... You will have to find it ;). You will be able to do some levels with your favorites musics and to share them with your friends !<br/>Uh ! As one final point ... Obstacles did not look like to rock x)<br/>I hope you will enjoy the game !</p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks</strong>\u00a0to\u00a0<strong>Sylvain Adas</strong>\u00a0who made an\u00a0<strong>original music</strong>\u00a0for the game !<br/></p>\n<p>Game made in August 2016.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b84ebcfd6ebf70b1a312b48657c0f3b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KIUProduction"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
