Build fires to stay warm and hunt rabbits to avoid starvation. But for how long must you continue on like this?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frigid is a lonely survival game that provides commentary on the nature of survival. You must trudge through every day, constantly doing what you need to survive with no reprieve. Although this is technically a game, the goal is to invoke a mood more than anything else.</p>\n<p>Submitted for Union College Game Jam.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Design/ coding - Fiabot</p>\n<p>Art - Fiabot\u00a0</p>\n<p>SFX - B.G.M, Little Robot Sound Factory, Dusty Room\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music - SD Sound Tracks,\u00a0Little Robot Sound Factory</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:02:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fiabot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
