This is a simple exploration game. Or at least, that's what I'd like you to believe. Different people experience different things in their lives, and that's reflected in this game. Things come and go, fleeting moments that are easy to miss. What causes things to come into existence? Were they always there, or do they only exist once they're perceived? There's more to life than death. If you don't find anything, close me. You digging through my secrets is unpleasant to me. You might get curious and decide to open me again, but maybe it'd be best if you didn't.<br/><br/>To-Do List:<br/><br/><ul><li>Open me<br/></li><li>Wake up<br/></li><li>Go outside<br/></li><li>Smell the flowers<br/></li><li>Stare at the horizon<br/></li><li>Come back inside<br/></li><li>Go get a cup of water<br/></li><li>Contemplate life<br/></li><li>Go back to bed<br/></li><li>Close me<br/><br/></li><li>...<br/><br/></li><li>Open me again?<br/></li><li>???</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dde95b0336fb413d8da18ff93bf585e.jpg", "website": "http://yaigameworks.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 21}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Yai Gameworks"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yai Gameworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
