Some people say feeling 'stoned' makes them feel chilled out and happy in their own thoughts, while others say it makes them giggly and chatty. But it can also make people feel lethargic, unmotivated and some people become paranoid, confused and anxious. Cannabis changes how you think and some people say it gives them a different perspective on things. It does affect your judgement though and people often think conversations or thoughts they have (whether good or bad) are much more deep or important when they\u2019re stoned than they would do normally.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:37:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f187e5e862d3df618ef987ebc4d2e3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TESTOHIRVI"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
