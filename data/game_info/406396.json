The size of a block is just determined by how far away the player is looking when they place it.\u00a0 After building out that interaction and the player movement, I made the materials for the blocks and the ground using Aseprite.  I like the idea of placing all these concrete-metallic blocks out in the desert. \u00a0 After, I borrowed some scripts I had from other projects to do some visual effects like the skybox, layered fog, and block shader.  I messed around with the colors for a while, and eventually had to settle.  It doesn\u2019t feel quite the way I would like it to feel.\u00a0 Finally, I made some sound effects using bfxr, but I don\u2019t think they feel like the right tone either.  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1bdebba2e286853d50d48da56500063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ben Haderle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
