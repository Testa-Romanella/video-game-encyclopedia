After it became  the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in 1998, Snake found a massive audience. \r\n</p>\n<p>The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane,  picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own  tail or the \"walls\" that surround the playing area. Each time the snake  eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game  increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's  head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The  player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress,  and cannot make the snake go in reverse. However, Snake has had many  variations since its release, depending on the game's platform. These  variations involve the modification of certain rules e.g. the lethality  of contact with walls. <br/></p>\r\nSNAKE &amp; TROUBLE\r\n<p>Snake &amp; Trouble features the recap of the iconic game 'Snake' or 'Snake Xenzia'\u00a0 The instructions are easy, youre a Snake that trying to eat apples (the red squares) and get a high score!</p>\n\r\nNOTICE: THE GAME IS NOT COMPLETED YET, YOU MAY NOTICE SOME BUGS AND NON COMPLETED CONTENT.\r\n\r\nHAVE FUN!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETS EAT SOME APPLES", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T06:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a636a4a0bb2833f6a6a65fad31e580cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Silent House Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
