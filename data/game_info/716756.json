The full version of the game is going to have a lot more content than this early demo, some ideas are more upgrades and possibly a leveling system. If you are interested in the game you can donate to help support me and any future games I may work on in the future.<br/></p>\n<p>Tutorial and Controls:</p>\n<p>Click the Pumpkin to get Points depending on the difficulty you set it to, Easy - 25 points gives you 5$, Normal - 50 points gives you 5$.
