Push rocks and other objects to clear the path to the final goal in each level!<br/><br/>Play as Sisyphus from Ancient Greek mythology, who got punished to push a rock for eternity in the underworld after having cheated Death twice. While this game does not go on for eternity, you can play over 60 different levels with varying difficulties, each level having the goal of pushing the white rock into the goal tile.<br/><br/>Contrary to many other Sokoban games, the objective in every Sisypush level is to bring just one special rock to the target tile. Additional mechanics such as larger rocks, rivers, or ice will present a challenge in many levels.<br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Over 60 levels, split up into 5 worlds<br/></li><li> A new game mechanic is introduced in each world<br/></li><li> A map-like level selection with branching paths<br/></li><li> Complete enough levels to unlock the gate to the next world<br/></li><li> Unlimited Undos<br/></li><li> Easy to learn<br/></li><li> Full controller support<br/></li><li> Minimalistic 1-bit art style<br/></li><li> 20 achievements.<br/></li><li> Optionally, you can try to optimize your route in each level and try to achieve the best rating.</li></ul><h3>This game is for you if:</h3><ul><li> You like puzzle games.<br/></li><li> You don't mind short games.<br/><ul><li>If you don't have much Sokoban experience, I estimate it will take 3 hours to complete every level. <br/></li><li>Experienced players will probably be able to complete the game in 1-2 hours.</li></ul></li><li> You like minimalist art.</li></ul><br/>Please consider wishlisting and following the game! :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T03:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2fb5f6cdd1337b50d3743ac36340dca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Centi Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Centi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
