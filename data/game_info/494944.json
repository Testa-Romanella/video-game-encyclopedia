The temporary solution until I manage to update and fix the problem is to not skip the dialog lines that apppear after the introduction, otherwise, the credits will appear before they are meant to and the application will close. The Game can be played without those dialog lines but since the controls are explained in that part\u00a0 you can find them here:</p>\n<p>W A S D to move around</p>\n<p>SPACE BAR to jump</p>\n<p>X to Skip Dialogs and Interact with interactable objects</p>\n<p>E when Jumping near the floating device (see screenshot 5) to bring yourself close to it and access the top right part of the map.</p>\n<p>The game is short and can be completed within minuts, you just need to find two energy cells and then go to the Energy platform (right part of the map) and press X.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I focused too much in polishing the graphics and I didn't find time in the end to add enough content such as enemies to defeat and power ups to unlock obstacles, beeing this last one such an important and characteristic feature of metroidvania games. I plan to upload this project soon and add all these elements and some others like platforming stages, boss fights and scape sequences. And of course I will try to improve my organization skills in the future to make games with a more balanced relation between graphics and gameplay.</p>\n<p>Enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05b/05b3a71c1c474c2a8525959956281452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AresGrenton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
