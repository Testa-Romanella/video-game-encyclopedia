{"id": 803213, "slug": "lost-in-linearity", "name": "Lost In Linearity", "name_original": "Lost In Linearity", "description": "<p><strong><em>A whole\u00a0new RPG Maker experience!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by the RPGM legends such as Yume Nikki/2kki, OFF, Lisa the Painful, and especially\u00a0 lesser known games like Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass,\u00a0Weird and Unfortunate Things are Happening, and No Delivery,\u00a0 comes a new contender to the world of\u00a0RPG Maker!</p>\n<p>Introducing Lost in Linearity,\u00a0 a game made in RPG Maker MV that aims to combine the best aspects of these games with a fresh new coat of paint that ain't ever been seen before! The game is a \"Yumevania\",\u00a0 combining the wide open ended\u00a0exploration of Yume Nikki/2kki\u00a0 and fun turn based RPG combat that aims to be better than most RPGMaker games that try to have combat. You'll play as Barley,\u00a0scouring the Abstraction, seeing sights both tranquil and terrifying, battling foes, and collecting effects to allow further access to areas that you normally couldn't reach without them!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This however is the kicker.\u00a0\u00a0In the game's full release,\u00a0 all of these side quests and areas will be COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.\u00a0The whole point of the game being that in the full release, your main goal is to\u00a0tackle a great maze that hides a great treasure in the center. It will be tough, and most likely kick your ass if you blindly go in. However with enough skill and luck, the game could theoretically\u00a0 be beaten in less than an hour. Your default equipment is perfectly capable of carrying your entire run but where's the fun in that?\u00a0Explore these unique worlds and become lost from your linear objective.<br/><br/><strong><em>(Soon to be)\u00a0Features:</em></strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Digital Hand Drawn art by yours truly, inspired by my favorite stuff like Captain Underpants, Kirby,\u00a0 and especially a ton of cartoons that I like.</p>\n<p>- A mature story not about the destination, but about the hidden details of Barley and the world she inhabits. Unravel more of her past as you explore...or don't.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0A wide variety of kooky worlds, some purely abstract dungeons that lead to even more abstract dungeons\u00a0or towns with their own stories, characters, and rewards.\u00a0The sky's the limit, usually being whatever comes to my first and I think would be neat to explore and fight through!\u00a0Expect content updates that's just me adding in random ass worlds I thought would be cool!</p>\n<p>- No level grinding! Instead...</p>\n<p>- A wide variety of items, weapons, armor, and trinkets that will provide a whole bunch\u00a0 moves and fighting styles! Each piece of gear is weirder than the last!</p>\n<p>-Fast paced and hectic turn based combat! Bring your wits because it's going to get rocky!</p>\n<p>-Dumbass improv\u00a0dialogue, reminiscent of shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I love dry ass humor.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0Some Shmuck (ME!!!!!)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong>NarcolepsyDriver and Thandta Tub/Puke\u00a0Nukem and Me</p>\n<p><strong>Music I don't own rights to and will be removed later (It's placeholder!):</strong></p>\n<p>Ghost by Machine Girl</p>\n<p>Ice\u00a0Cream\u00a0Headache from Skullgirls<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cd156d4b39c11754eac66011260b246.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Some Shmuck"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
