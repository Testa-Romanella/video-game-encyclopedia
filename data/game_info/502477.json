Great! That completes the party for a nice game of D&amp;D (\u201cDice &amp; Doom\u201d, that is):<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Siebenstreich\u2019s Nerdventure is an upbeat 2D adventure game, pioneering the fantastic genre of pop culture fairytales. Look forward to witty dialog, puzzling puzzles (yep, sorry, pun intended), an amazing soundtrack as well as lovingly hand-drawn artwork and animations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While your party of unlikely heroes sets out to rescue a realm in distress, you\u2019ll take cooking lessons with Mr. &amp; Mr. Giant, outsmart a gang of flies and prove yourself in the improvised game shows hosted by the guerilla unicorn Sylvester Stallione. Among other things. And, rumor has it, the fabled throne Up'Zhykling might be up for grabs as well.
