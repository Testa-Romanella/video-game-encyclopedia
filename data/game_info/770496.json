It is a 2D platform video game created in Unity. It is created to play it on PC and soon I will export it to be able to play it on other platforms. You will explore a universe where your objective will be to collect coins and travel as far as possible without dying trying. Eye, because it will not be so simple. You will find enemies, moving platforms and you will have to pay attention to the route. You will find potion elements that will give you extra help to successfully overcome the most demanding levels.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Enjoy it!</em></p><p><em>You can consult and do this project in the course\u00a0</em><em>\u00a0</em></p><p>https://platzi.com/cursos/desarrollo-unity/</p>\n\n<p><strong>\ud83c\udfae  Controls :</strong></p>\n<p>D or Right : Run to Right\u00a0</p>\n<p>A or Left : Run to Left</p>\n<p>Space : Jump</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button : Super Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:40:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/493/493a9edd1babb9852e850c507db51d75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FranDevGame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
