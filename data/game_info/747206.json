{"id": 747206, "slug": "real-is-not-real", "name": "Real Is Not Real", "name_original": "Real Is Not Real", "description": "<p>A game made for the 2022 Brackey's game jam. The theme for the game is \"It's not real.\" I attempted to fit into that theme by having objects in the game be in varying states of reality with some only being viewable with a special camera.</p>\n<p>You must use your camera to catalog your supernatural encounters in the house. Was that chair always there? Is what I am seeing even real?\u00a0Can you find all the evidence you need to figure out what really happened in that house?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>MOVEMENT\u00a0 - WASD or arrow keys</p>\n<p>AIM - Mouse</p>\n<p>INTERACT -\u00a0Open and close doors with the E key. (NOTE: To complete the game, you must use the front door to exit the house.)</p>\n<p>CAMERA - To activate your camera press and hold the right mouse button and then left-click to take a photo. (You cannot move while taking photos!).</p>\n<p>PAUSE - press the 'Escape' key.</p>\n<p>EDIT: To reach the end of the game you have to interact with the front door. I\u00a0wanted to elaborate more on the point system. There are five types of objects that are worth points, mission items, possessed items, cursed items, interactions, and ghosts. Mission items and possessed items appear only in the camera view and possessed items will move around the house randomly. Cursed items can be seen in both normal and camera view and start in a random position each game. Interactions can be seen in both views and spawn at certain times and will disappear after enough time has passed. Ghosts cannot be seen in camera view until a picture has been taken of them. The chaser enemy is a unique entity, respawns, and is worth as many points as an interaction.</p>\n<p>Attribution for game assets used in the game are in the credits menu of the main menu.
