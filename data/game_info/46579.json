{"id": 46579, "slug": "godkin", "name": "Godkin", "name_original": "Godkin", "description": "Godkin is a combat RPG where you (and, optionally, a team of online friends) play as demi-gods ('Godkins') tasked with saving mortal worlds that are under attack from various monsters. Each world is procedurally generated and consists of villages, forests, caves, and monster camps. You must hunt down and destroy the monsters, while protecting the villages (and their villagers) from attack. As you progress through the worlds, you will gather mortal heroes as your followers. Although these followers worship you they are mere mortals and may die, and they are governed by their Courage statistic which affects how closely they will follow your orders in dangerous situations. You marshal the village defences, directing your followers to gather resources and build walls and towers, or to accompany you on forays against the monster camps.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Become A God<br/></li><li> Master Your Power<br/></li><li> Help Your Worshippers - Help your worshippers survive on their cruel worlds</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a82/a82aaa65aed2cc392e763abc466a1b6b.jpg", "website": "http://godkin.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Psychic Software", "Goblin Portal"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Psychic Software", "Goblin Portal"], "esrb_rating": null}
