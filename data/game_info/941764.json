Since then, this project has been collecting dust and I figured I'd at least make it playable.<br/><br/><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/>In order to play the game, you need to put numbers in the boxes under the creatures. Think of it as more clunky FNAF custom night. Press\u00a0<strong>ENTER\u00a0</strong>to start the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Use WASD to move your character, hold space to sleep (can only do when in living room), and click the mouse to turn on your flashlight.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to Win<br/></strong>-The only mechanic I will tell you is how to win, sleep through the night and avoid the intruder. There are other creatures you can enable to make the game more difficult, but those have mechanics you'll have to figure out yourself.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note<br/></strong>-This game may contain bugs, I am not fixing them as this project is canned.<br/>-In order to play properly, make sure intruder is set to at least 1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T10:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df9eef34f088515be492b099c356f895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wolfy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
