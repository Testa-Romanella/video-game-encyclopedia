You can walk around and interact with either the signs or tv sets in each room.</p>\n<p> \r\nThere's a little bit more to this game, but I'll just let some art critic describe it: \"The Sunday Museum is a game that socialises self-ironic assembles from various pregnant and megalomaniac outputs. This counterbalance of sequences comments the surrogate dialog towards an uncomfortably participated plotline. It marginalises long-term and descriptive cycles from various launched landscapes. The contemporary, cybernetic miscarriage accredits and arranges the spatiality. This eloquent sub-phenomenon tapes and desiderates an array of labels specifyed by the ability to transliterate.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4da88b086f3bad1a2e3edb42c9a26ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunshine_Error"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
