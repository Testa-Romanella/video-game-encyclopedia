(Can we get to #1?) Top loved!! Finally! A tile system making use of hexagons without ridiculously complex coding! A level generator like this could probably create some really nice looking smooth cave levels. There is currently no way to win this game, as this was made just to test a hexagonal tile system. This project will generate you a random level filled with pools, tunnels, dirt and stone for you to explore! \u2605CREDITS\u2605 Coding - Me Art - Me Music - myfreemp3music.com/ Sound Effects - Scratch, and Terraria by @griffpatch Thumbnail Text - cooltext.com \u2605UPDATES\u2605 v1.1 Mobile controls added v1.0 Shared!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T03:37:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6ef704efb1a5f7a0de69ba1b7e8ef16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["homypony"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
