A lot of this game was inspired by the aesthetic of the witches, so it's safe to say I truly couldn't have made this without 9E0's asset pack!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything else in Witchball was created by me, and I'm not quite done with it. I have a few more features in mind (including, but not limited to, levels and special attacks!) that I'd like to implement before I mark this project complete. There's also a fair bit already done that could use some more polishing!</p>\n<p>It'd mean a lot to me if you'd leave\u00a0a comment with your feedback and followed me here or on my socials (linked below). And if you really liked the game (or just want the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting a solo indie dev), you can click the support button above!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Either way, thank you so much for reading this far and for checking out my game\u00a0\u00a0\u2728\ud83e\udd17\u2728</p>\n<p>Hope to see you around for\u00a0<strong>Witchball's next update, coming December 21st</strong>!
