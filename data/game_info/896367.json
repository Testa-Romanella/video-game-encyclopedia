But here's the twist: if the player dies, the game will automatically delete itself! This adds an extra layer of excitement and urgency to the gameplay, as players must constantly strive to improve their skills in order to avoid losing the game altogether. With vibrant graphics and a pulse-pounding soundtrack, this game is sure to keep players on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Will you be able to outmaneuver your enemies and emerge victorious, or will the game disappear forever? The only way to find out is to play and see!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T21:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a3b968fd732cda96f8cd770902ae574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ryegame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
