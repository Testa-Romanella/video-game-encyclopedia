They purchased the house for a really good price, but there was a catch\u2026 the house doesn\u2019t have electricity, the wires are very old and need to be replaced.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe individual that bought the house has been working on some kind of hand crank generators for many months and now it\u2019s a great opportunity to test them out, he set 4 devices around the house, that\u2019s all you have to rely for lighting during the night.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThese devices had been pretty stable during the development, but there is something in the house that\u2019s making them unstable.
