There's the Farmers whose main objective is to water a given amount of pumpkins and the other team called Lurkers are trying to prevent that by catching them. The lurkers have the ability to transform themselves into a pumpkin to blend into the environment and emerge as soon as they feel ready to go. The farmers are carrying a shotgun with limited ammo along with a watering can that can run out of water. These can be recharged at one of the two barns located on the map.<br/>\r\nThere are three main adjustable parameters that determines one game: How many pumpkins to spawn, How many pumpkins to water, How many Lurker AIs to spawn (set it up if you wish to play in coop with your friends).<br/>\r\nA game will end if the number of pumpkins to water are met or all farmers or lurkers are dead.<br/>\r\nThe game only supports friend based matchmaking through Steam overlay.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T04:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc562650441e8405f4e0c25bffc5a956.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hyjarion"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyjarion"], "esrb_rating": null}
