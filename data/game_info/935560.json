You must make it to the end of an area filled with patrolling drones without getting caught. The enemies will chase you if they see you, but can't see through walls, and will forget they saw you if you go out of sight. Red walls will kill you, but you can pass through grey walls. There are green buttons that will make the enemies panic; they won't be able to see you when they're panicking. Good luck!</p>\n<p>WASD to move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game involves some fast moving lights, so please take care if you have photosensitivity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e32a42c3bde89265925bf79318cb9fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RedDragonMakesGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
