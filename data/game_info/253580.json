{"id": 253580, "slug": "free-chess-clock", "name": "Free Chess Clock", "name_original": "Free Chess Clock", "description": "If you play much chess you know just how much fun timed games of chess can be. Whether you are a casual player or a seasoned pro, having a chess clock at your disposal is a must. Free Chess Clock gives you the ability to have a chess clock with you at all times. <br/><br/>There are quite a few chess clocks available for the iPhone, so let me tell you why this one is better than the others:<br/><br/>1. This chess clock is beautifully designed.<br/>Honestly, there isn't anything revolutionary about this timer -- it's just a fancy clock afterall. So if all chess timers pretty much do the same thing, what can set one apart from the rest? Well, this timer was created by a designer that has polished and refined it to a point that puts other clocks to shame. Why use an ugly clock when you can have one that can hold its own sitting next to your beautiful Staunton pieces?<br/><br/>2. It's free.<br/>Again, this is just a clock. Save your money. You earned it. There are a bunch of chess clocks on iTunes anywhere from $0.99 to $10.00. If you can find something that these clocks do better than mine let me know. I will add the feature and release an update. I am not out to get rich, I just want to make a really great app that people will use.<br/><br/>3. No advertisements.<br/>Most free apps are cluttered with ads or not-so-subtle attempts to convince you to buy something else. This one is ad-free. If you like this app enough to search out more of my chess apps, there is a tasteful little button on the home screen that you can browse at your leisure. No pressure. No ads. Ever.<br/><br/>4. Made with love.<br/>I know it's a bit cheesy, but I really took care when I built this app. I love chess and I wanted to honor that passion with something really nice. Is that a reason to download this app? Probably not. But if you can relate to my love of the game I hope you appreciate my work.<br/><br/>Thanks for using Free Chess Timer. If you are gracious enough to look for a way to thank me, you can do me a favor. First of all, give my app a good rating on iTunes. Writing a positive review would be even better. Finally, check out my other chess apps when they become available. I have free demos of everything, so you never have to purchase anything until you are sure you want what you are paying for.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d0/1d0e433fb688a947dcb15ae91fd44702.jpg", "website": "http://adrian3.com/projects/chess/chess-clock-app-for-iphone/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adrian3"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Adrian Hanft"], "esrb_rating": null}
