You can do so by creating mighty stone walls with your mouse:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 - Left Mouse Button: drag and drop to create a wall</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 - Right Mouse Button: drag to erase walls \u00a0</p>\n<p>But be careful: if Popies and Gonzos don't eat for a certain time they will starve to death, but keep them well fed and they'll procreate!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: This game sucks so much!<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>I know that! It was made during the Wowie Game Jam 4.0, a Game jam lasted 84 hours (12/08/22 - 15/08/22); it was also my first somewhat serious project, and I own the fact that I'm a bad programmer. But you gotta start somewhere! ^_^'<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:28:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f6/0f6c0bfa84e31221b9354b232728bf3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mangio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
