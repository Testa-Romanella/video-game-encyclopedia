What <em>exactly</em> makes one feel \"at home\" depends on the person you ask, though.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you ask the local\u00a0<strong>carnivorous</strong> desert sandworm, its ideal home would be a nice, warm, <strong>dark,\u00a0twisty underground maze</strong>. The shade protects you from the scorching sun, there's enough room for the\u00a0family to bump into each other from time to time\u00a0but not too much... <em>ah... the ideal sandworm life.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Unluckily for you, you're DEFINITELY NOT a sandworm.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You're instead one of the many creatures who falls more often than not\u00a0into one of those <em>bug awful</em> pits. Even worse,\u00a0you left your tools on the outside! At least you got two pairs of\u00a0<strong>strong arms to climb</strong>...
