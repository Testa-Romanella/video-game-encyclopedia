Please try it with an older Bluetooth USB dongle with Bluetooth 3.x or older.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></em></li></ol>\n<ol><li><strong>Download and unzip</strong> the \"<strong>Wii\u00a0Remote Pack for Error Ware</strong>\" from this site.

The game is still fun to play with mouse &amp;\u00a0keyboard controls. In the sequel <strong>Error Ware 2</strong> playing with a Wii Remote is much easier (you don't need GlovePIE for it), but back when I made this game I didn't know better :)</p>\n<p>You can ask for help <strong>in the comments</strong> or tweet me @U-GameZ_McJey<strong>. </strong>I also love to share <strong>reviews and videos</strong> of people from around the world playing my games! <strong>I\u00a0made a YouTube playlist</strong> with some of my favorite videos of people enjoying Error Ware.
