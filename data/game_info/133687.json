This should make all levels, while not perfect, at least playable. You can also try changing the window size to be 1x as opposed to 2x, this may help speed things up a tad :).</p><p>This Game is free (or you can pay if you like!) and was made for The Daily Click's (www.create-games.com) Xmas Competition 2007. </p><p>For optimal playing experience you will need a keyboard that supports up to 5 key presses at once ( e.g. Jump + Run + Shoot + Right + Down ) or a joystick.</p><p>This game includes the full source for Multimedia Fusion 2 (now Clickteam Fusion 2.5). All extensions used are under the extensions folder in the appropriate Data/Runtime and Extensions directories, so you should be able to open my MFA.
