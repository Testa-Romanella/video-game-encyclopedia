The theme was level design out of context.<br/>This game is about a squishy slime which need to jump across the level and eat slimeballs to survive. When the level starts, the slime inherit of a color (black or white). He can only jump on a platform of the opposite color but he can only eat slimeballs that are the same color as it. There are also gears all around the map. If the slime hits those gears, he dies. Thanks to a bonus, the slime can swap color, and the camera can rotate upside down.<br/>I made this game with the help of Zinatiix who made the art and the music.</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7b/d7b9c1e9969da3e0a783a615f19aa75c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PirateStorm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
