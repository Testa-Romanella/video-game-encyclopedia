All maps,\u00a0 jobs, and story is my original creation. I use mostly basic assets and many of Visustella's core plugins (https://visustellamz.itch.io/) to help bring more quality of life functions to the game.</p>\n<p>RMBL: Rumble on the Block<br/>A game where you play as new kid that just moved to the suburbs of a big city. Your school is the lowest ranked school in the district. Your purpose is to gain strength and help build your school reputation through good ol' fashion, anime-style combat.\u00a0</p>\n<p> Features:</p>\n<p>-Choose between 6 different archetypes and self-assign your attributes to help compete against the other schools!</p>\n<p>-Use various ARMs to enhance your combat capabilities!</p>\n<p>-Explore a huge city map with dangers around every corner!</p>\n\n<p>P.S.<br/></p>\n<p>As this is my first full game there will be updates to it as I complete more on my free time. I am very fond and enjoy making this game and have an overall plan for it, but as I am handling all of this on my own it will take time, but I hope you enjoy what I provide so far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c28/c2899aa015eb7a4d2b0393573a0e4488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CG_Sidd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
