Each moved card can only be placed in the empty position after all the cards have been removed or the upper card that is 1 point larger than the card at the bottom.<br/>\r\nOnly when all the cards in a group are of the same suit can the group of cards be moved. Otherwise, only the top card of the group or multiple cards of the same suit can be moved.<br/>\r\nWhen moving to form a group of consecutive cards from K to the same suit, the group of cards will be automatically removed and sorted to the lower left, and score rewards will be obtained. At the same time, it will impact the spectators in different scenes. When there are not enough cards, click on the card column below to deal the cards. <br/>\r\nBreakthrough mode gameplay: Kun is a mythical beast that can lay eggs by eating food. WASD controls Kun up, down, left, and right, space controls acceleration, and QEF and other buttons use skills (after unlocking skills). A bomb will appear at the beginning of the second level, and it will explode if you get closer. In subsequent levels, there will be bosses and unlocked skills. The more eggs Kun lays, the higher the score will be, which will have an impact on the spectators in the room. When the skill immunity is not used, Kun should not hit the eggs he laid,or the game will end. Pay attention to protect Kun's head from attacks.<br/>\r\nThis story is purely fictitious and any similarity is purely coincidental.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-22T06:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55ba10ae3e0e52b9a53e2cd6de162658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u771f\u7231\u7c89"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u771f\u7231\u7c89"], "esrb_rating": null}
