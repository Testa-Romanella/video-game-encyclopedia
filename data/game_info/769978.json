I came up with the idea of this game and I created it in 2 nights. The game seemed good, so I decided to post it here, on itch io.</p>\n<p>There is no specific plot in the game, you just build your city and watch how your actions affect it!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Create any appearance of the city that you want! Only your imagination limits you</p>\n<p>\u2022 Spend money at your discretion</p>\n<p>\u2022 Watch the consequences of your actions and only you influence them!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Will your city prosper or wither?</p>\n<p>\u2022 There are 4 indicators in total: try to raise them all and keep them on the level!</p>\n<p>\u2022 Support and develop the city</p>\n<p>\u2022 Follow the indicators and achieve the best results!</p>\n<p>What your city will be like is up to you!</p>\n<p>Genre: Constructor, economic strategy, city, buildings, sandbox</p>\n<p>The game was made in 2 nights, and by one person, that's why it's like this now. I have many more ideas on how to improve it, but I want to see your opinion. If I see activity, the game will be updated and supplemented.</p>\n<p>There are plans to add new events, indicators and objects!</p>\n<p>Feedback. Write\u00a0 to my twitter.
