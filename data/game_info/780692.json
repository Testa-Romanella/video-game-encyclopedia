Featuring Bloody fatalities, 7 playable characters each with their own special moves, and exciting gameplay that defined a generation. This was also one of the games that started the ESRB System and that sure didn't stop them. Now I wanted to do this game for the 30th anniversary of this legendary arcade game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this version it has 10 playable characters including Reptile, Goro, and Shang Tsung.</p>\n<p>Original Arcade Music</p>\n<p>New Fatalities but some are still the same.</p>\n<p>New Survival and Team Mode</p>\n<p>I grew up with Mortal Kombat in the 90's and it had magic and excitement. Even though I can't wait to do Mortal Kombat 2 because that is my favorite in the series.</p>\n<p>I hope that I can bring you the excitement and thrills of this legendary game that started the Mortal Kombat Series.</p><p>Please Note that this is a M rated game because of the violence and gore so parental discretion is advised.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:02:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daf/daf6f86952260c7c2447963c76d15481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["campotech"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
