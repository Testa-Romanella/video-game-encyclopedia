(Matheus135)", "description": "<p><em>On the Fly!</em> is a 2D arcade-style game where players take control of a little fly who is searching for a myriad of food and other goodies while trying to survive in an assortment of locations, including a family\u2019s house, the sewers, and an open field with trees.</p>\n\n<p>Players must tap the touch screen to make the fly ascend. As the world around the fly moves down the screen, the fly itself must continue to ascend in order to survive. As the fly ascends, it constantly moves from one side of the screen to the other, moving the opposite direction every time it bumps into a wall. Players must tap the screen to maintain and control the fly\u2019s ascent so that it does not fall prey to any of the traps and enemies spread amongst the walls, or fall below the screen. If the fly gets caught in a trap or falls outside of the screen, the fly dies and the game is lost. Players must prevent the fly from meeting this fate for as long as they can, while also gathering points and power-ups to complete objectives and unlock new content. </p>\n<p>Main Features</p>\n<ul><li>The game's perspective is derived off of 2D arcade-style games such as <em>Jet Pack Joyride</em> and <em>Flappy Bird</em>.</li><li>The game's art style is reminiscent of simple 2D cartoons of its type.</li><li>The rules of the game work as such: At the start of each level, players will have an objective where they must reach a score threshold in order to progress to the next level. Along the way, they will encounter different traps and enemies looking to impede their progress. If players reach a score threshold in a level, they will unlock the next level. However, if they lose, they will get a game over and will have to restart the level.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fa/7fa526418e5b0c51b4e48e57dc43646b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Matheus135"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
