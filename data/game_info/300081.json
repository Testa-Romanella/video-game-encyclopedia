This is my submission for the Retro Jam (https://itch.io/jam/retro-jam-80s)</p>\n<p>This is a souls like first person shooter\u00a0with a low poly western/science fiction aesthetic. I'm hoping to make this the first part of a short trilogy of 'episodes' spread across the three game jams I'm participating in. The goal is to have the story line run\u00a0\u00a0across all three episodes to slowly piece it all together.</p>\n<p>I hope you all have fun!
