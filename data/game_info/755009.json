Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game \u2013 simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in.<br/><br/><strong>The VR Grid:</strong> It\u2019s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey.  From the opening moments of the game, all the way to it\u2019s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. <br/><br/>Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to action-packed, fast-paced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown.<br/><br/><strong>6DOF Reviews:</strong> Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any I\u2019ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that it\u2019s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration.<br/><br/>Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime.<br/><br/><strong>VR Focus:</strong>A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T04:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/355/355adcf18572221db806cbb78a72572b.jpg", "website": "https://mare-eye.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 367, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Visiontrick Media"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Visiontrick Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
