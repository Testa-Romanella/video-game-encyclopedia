Although the \"engine\" is somewhat advanced, it is necessary to add a lot of things. The game pretends to be a sandbox with a bit of survival and a bit of retro mechanics. The graphic style will be cartoon type using a kind of mode 7 (2.5d). In this state what i most need is feedback.<br/>Thank you very much for trying it and also for your interest in the game. No downloads for the moment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e499b61d64d93ce680c1d2590a56419f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nowherek"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
