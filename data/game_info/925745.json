The theme was \"Just another copy\". In this game's lore the wind-up maids are mass manufactured copies, but there was once an original, a flesh and blood human girl. Nothing resembling lore made it into the actual jam game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Up arrow to jump. No other controls.</p><p>Walls and other wind-up dolls slow you down. The goal is to get as far as you can before you run out of energy.<br/></p>\n<p>If you run out of energy or you fall to your death, you have to reload the game. There is no respawn function.
