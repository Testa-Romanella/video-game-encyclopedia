Created by Bear Bros Conglomerate.</p>\n<p>A Pint to the Serpent Kingdom is a game about ice cream. The serpent kingdom needs ice cream so as an ice cream delivery monkey it is your job to get it to them before it melts!</p>\n<p>Bear Bros Conglomerate is comprised of bearguitar11 (philipbear93 on discord) and angrymuffin.</p>\n<p>Please focus critiques primarily on gameplay elements over art. Our resident artist had other responsibilities this weekend come up so he had to do a game jelly instead. Looking for ideas on how to clean up the game's balance and sprite management. We're pretty pleased with the result being a first foray into game development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ae/7aedf5f28d625fc27e97155ae2157f81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BearBrosConglomerate"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
