It is a spin-off from the Shin Megami Tensei series, itself part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. Since release, it has been ported to mobile devices, the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and re-released digitally through Nintendo&#39;s Virtual Console service. The story follows a student of Karukozaka High School after their school is sucked into the realm of demons by a vengeful student&#39;s demon summoning spell going wrong.<br />\nShin Megami Tensei If... was developed as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school setting was the impetus for the creation of the spin-off Persona series.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T12:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d77679fb31131a5f9757d47a5fdec8b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 7, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 30, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["iOS", "Wii U", "Wii", "PlayStation", "PC", "SNES"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": null}
