Now it's a game.</p>\n<p>Or, will be a game - I tried to fit it into a week for this half-year's \"GAMES MADE QUICK???\", because the scribbly rushed theme is rather apt. Delving headfirst into Unity for the first time is perhaps not something that fits into a week though, so it's just a prototype for now (press numbers to spawn bloons). Maybe I'll get back to it eventually.<br/></p>\n<p>*Bloons copyright to Ninja Kiwi, not me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20f/20f1dc77d2bdc13f205224269bb4effc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Topper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
