When building a Unity project on Windows, these flags aren't added as it isn't possible by default on the Windows operating system. This results in a message \"The app 'Mac' could not be opened\" when trying to open on OS\u00a0X. This issue can be resolved as follows:</p>\n<p>1. Go into System Settings &gt; Security and Privacy to enable non-Apple Store apps to run.</p>\n<p>2. In the Terminal, navigate to the download folder (wherever you put the downloaded app) using the following command:<br/>cd [PATH_TO_APP_FOLDER]<br/></p>\n<p>3. Grant executable permissions using the following command:<br/>chmod -R 777 ./Mac.app</p>\n<p>This will unlock permissions for the app to run. You'll then need to allow permission through Mac Firewall\u00a0to let it run on the computer.</p>\n<p>Right click on the app and\u00a0a dropdown window will pop up. Click \"Open\" in this list and in the subsequent popup click \"Open\" again.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:54:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57f/57fb97571a35b04e1af8f9a18bb02651.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shiba Dog Studios", "jardle1", "Hanushi"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
