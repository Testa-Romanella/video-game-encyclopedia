Only Hera Carter, a native of the town, can stop it, but to do so she'll need to travel the world to recover ancient artifacts. In the process, she makes choices that will change the world forever.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Historia of Urth - \"Devil Rebellion\", is a top down story driven RPG that features challenging combat,\u00a0 quests with multiple solutions and a wry sense of humor. Lead a party of four heroes, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Make difficult moral choices that have long lasting consequences. Work with a robust and comprehensive skill system that opens up a variety of paths and play styles.</p>\n<p>How will you fight? Should you fight? The choice is yours.</p>\n<p>This game is set in the same world and features a few returning characters from my last game Hustle Quest. You do NOT have to play Hustle Quest to understand Devil Rebellion, as it's a standalone story.</p>\n<p>Devil Rebellion is currently in early access. It's my hope that you, yes YOU, can help me refine the current build (and future builds) into the best game it can possibly be. Once the game is complete, it will no longer be free. Currently the game contains the completed prologue and one of the major quest areas. Some things that need to be done include:</p>\n<p>- Spelling and grammar checks for all non-critical writing (I.E. quests and codex entries).</p>\n<p>- General game balance.</p>\n<p>- Implementation of the remaining three major areas.<br/></p>\n<p>- Implementation of the end game.</p>\n<p>- Implementation of reactive companion dialogue, companion quests and possibly romances.</p>\n<p>- Implementation of a proper tutorial (for now everything you need to know is included in the readme)</p>\n<p>For news on the game's progress check the official Devil Rebellion discord, which is also where you can contact me regarding bugs:\u00a0https://discord.gg/jWuRxWeXzH</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this. Enjoy the game.\u00a0 :)</p><p>Content Warning: Devil Rebellion includes strong language, sexual situation as well as themes of racism, trauma, abuse and systemic discrimination.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T04:45:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3b8912cbfd14603022f8659ad00e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nazenthedark"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
