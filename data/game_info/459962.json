Every 8 seconds the square you control changes. Highlight your way in through darkness by painting obstacles and marking them. Also, each square has its own unique theme song! Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Begginers: Yes, this is our first game jam! We appreciate all criticism you can give.<br/></p>\n<p>Game Engine: Unity 2019.4f<br/></p>\n<p>Relevance to the theme: \u00a0You control two squares with the goal of reuniting them. Each square has it's own colour, effects and music, making the TWO of them very unique. By limiting the view distance and alternating the players turn, we wanted to encourage the player use the colours to paint their path to a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Assets:<br/>Simplifica Font https://www.behance.net/gallery/14209843/SIMPLIFICA-Typeface-Free<br/>SFX \u201cWet Gooey Liquid Splash https://freesfx.co.uk/sfx/splat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T04:45:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b50/b50e69752002fabcbf0a3abd4f598c58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lucas Salaverry F\u00e9lix", "maumau"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
