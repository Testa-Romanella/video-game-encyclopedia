{"id": 59595, "slug": "depths-of-boatmurdered", "name": "Depths of Boatmurdered", "name_original": "Depths of Boatmurdered", "description": "<p>Depths of Boatmurdered is a free top-down horror game inspired by the infamous Let\u2019s Play of Dwarf Fortress, Boatmurdered. The game is ~2 hours long and follows a lost dwarf who stumbles upon the terrible ruins of Boatmurdered. However, you can play through just fine without any knowledge of the Let\u2019s Play!<br/><br/>Depths of Boatmurdered only very vaguely adheres to the original layout of the fortress from the Let\u2019s Play. It also largely ignores established Dwarf Fortress lore (I haven\u2019t played any Dwarf Fortress).<br/>If you\u2019re interested, please give it a try! (Windows only)<br/><br/>Tips:<br/>\r\nKeyboard and Xbox controllers are both supported!<br/>Being able to dead-end yourself is very rare, so if you feel stuck, it\u2019s likely there\u2019s something nearby that you missed.<br/>Even with a weapon, enemies cannot be killed \u2013 try to escape instead!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/26d/26d3183ff9518754301e58901bfac2fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rad Codex"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
