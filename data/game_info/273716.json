I ran out of time to get the AI working. </p>\n<p>Bokah is a fight to the death made of pure light. Based on my Bokah, I am incredibly short sighted and the only upside is the pure beauty of lights at night. It is an explosion of colour and pattern. I tried my best to draw it and the game is made entirely of this image.</p>\n<p>Player 1 controls:\r\nArrows and \u201cm\u201d to fire</p>\n<p>Player 2 controls:\r\nwasd and \u201cr\u201d to fire</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t go too far from the Rainbow centre or you will loose life over time.</p>\n<p>Fire to engage your default stance</p>\n<p>Once you have your stance equipped, your weapon time line will start to move. Hit the beat to fire a weapon</p>\n<p>If you miss you will lose life and your stance will turn off</p>\n<p>Change stances by hitting the alternative colours</p>\n<p>Each stance has different properties</p>\n<p>Every time you fire you sacrifice 12HP</p>\n<p>The HP \u2018powers\u2019 your weapon. The HP attached to the projectile drops off at a steady rate. Be quick and you can pick it back up. You can collect your enemies HP too! Any HP still attached acts as a damage multiplier.</p>\n<p>Find your rhythm, work out your combinations and annihilate the light. Be careful not to be too trigger happy. Sacrifices will be made.</p>\n<p>I had so much I wanted to do but this is as far as I got.
