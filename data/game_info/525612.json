I've always enjoyed making games and felt it was time to get one out there for others to play. The game has been made with the help of some friends such as the music, logo, and voice acting. Hopefully, if you play this game you enjoy the time you spend in it and if you have any questions about WOTW then contact me and I'll try my best to help answer any inquiries you may have.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T02:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc1/fc16e94188600fd9f12045cfc318e1d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marc Hansen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Land Of Pixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
