That necessitated creating a meta-story about what was \"really\" going on. Execution is key with that sort of thing, and I don't think I executed very well.</li><li>Oh boy I tried to do way too much.</li><li>The build I submitted for judging is somewhat incomplete, the \"ending\" doesn't really explain anything.</li><li>It became hard to tell what parts of the \"story\" I had actually put in the game and which parts were still in my head. In the future, I'll have to find ways of keeping track of this.</li><li>I found ways to de-scope the game as the jam progressed (and I ran out of time). I like that my design was flexible enough to have 80% removed and still function (probably).</li><li>A lot of the \"narrative\" I was going for ended up \"outside\" of the game proper, in other places, but are still mentioned in the game. I wonder if players will be interested in seeking those out. If they'll even believe the website and email address are real.</li><li>Without the full story, I'm not sure I took full advantage of the theme. The game as it is probably doesn't match that theme much at all.</li><li>Thinking about it, the game turned out to basically be a 2D \"walking simulator\". There were a lot more mechanics and content planned, but I couldn't execute.</li><li>In week 2 I got really sick, very high fever, etc. I lost about 5 days to that.</li><li>With 4 days to go, a friend asked me to be a part of their wedding party, at a destination wedding on the last day of the jam. That ate a lot of time.</li><li>Life happens, you can't design for that.</li><li>Open-sourcing my code was fun, I sort of got a release rush every time I pushed even the tiniest feature to github.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96be04418ab072d1dee5bdac04762979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NuclearEagleFox"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
