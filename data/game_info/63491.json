It's akin to a roguelike except it features progression in the form of expanding your spell crafting capabilities to craft a vast array of spells and by obtaining new passive abilities that synergize with your builds.<br/><br/>I can't promise more detailed features just yet as the game is not close enough to release.<br/><br/>NOTE: THIS GAME IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.
