I hope it\u2019s not too frustrating! We\u2019ll update its soon!</p>\n<p><strong>THE SOLVANDUS</strong> is a 2D Platformer Game, Just a simple Action - Adventure game in the Unity. This demo is meant to specifically highlight <strong>TheSolvandus</strong> gameplay system and is based on an unfinished version of the game. Many assets are unfinished and the content of the demo may not be representative of the final game. Note, this was a hastily slapped together demo, so do not be surprised to find bugs, glitches, or very unfinished content! This is a game using completely home-made assets.
