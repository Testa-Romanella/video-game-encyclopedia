{"id": 195964, "slug": "pocket-smash", "name": "Pocket Smash", "name_original": "Pocket Smash", "description": "<p>This repository was created on a late April afternoon, 2017, with the purpose of creating\r\na video game, just for fun, with some friends from school using the Construct 2 game engine.\r\nHowever, things fell through, because of one thing or another; never the less, we\r\ndecided to abandon the game all together.</p>\n<p>Few months later is when GitHub announced their game jam for 2017. As soon as I heard of it\r\nI wanted to join, but lacked the drive to do so. However a couple of days into the\r\ncompetition I was reminded of it by my friend during school.</p>\n<p>Since, at the time, we weren't doing anything too important in class I\r\n started thinking\r\nof possible games I can develop for the game jam, with the \"throwback\" \r\ntheme on my mind.\r\nSoon enough, I started thinking about pokemon and how much\r\nI enjoyed the fights and collection of pokemon; but, at the same time I\r\ndetested the constant grinding and repetition that was needed to be able\r\n to enjoy those things. Which lead me to this game game where I can have\r\n everything I love without the stuff I hate.</p>\n<p>So, to make a long story short, I had this rep sitting around without use, and wanted the name\r\n\u201cPocket-Smash\u201d for my game jam submission. Which is why I recycled the rep for my game jam\r\nproject. Meaning nothing in this rep was worked on previous to the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36f/36f1de3c2a137631b59c481836595241.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ClarkThyLord"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
