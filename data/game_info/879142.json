Incoming - Cowbell is getting bigger, cannot be touched yet.<br/>2. Tractorable - Tractor Beam can be attached to the Cowbell by touching it, but you cannot collect it yet.<br/>3. Glowing - Touch the Cowbell to collect it and get a point.<br/>4. Blinking - Same as Tractorable, but it's warning you that it will be gone soon.<br/>5. Fading - Cowbell cannot be touched anymore, it's gone.\r\n</p>\n<p>To attach the Tractor Beam, touch the cowbell first.<br/>Only Glowing Cowbell can be collected for score.<br/>If you Tractor Beam a Blinking Cowbell, it will go back to Tractorable.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the main menu, the music and sound switchers have multiple levels, not just ON/OFF.\r\n</p>\n<p>In multiplayer, players can steal each other's Cowbells and try to lure missiles to the other player. After one player dies, the other one is on a death counter.\r\n</p>\n<p>In peaceful mode there is no enemy fire, but every Cowbell left to fade out will deal 1 damage to the closest player UFO.\r\n</p>\n<p>Programming: JohnyDaison, Uzasnak98\r\n</p>\n<p>Graphics: JohnyDaison\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: JohnyDaison\r\n</p>\n<p>Music: Martin Rezny - Rezonance (CZ)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T13:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3ad2eac897193fec3f0bc0b80fb076f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Johny Daison", "nartim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
