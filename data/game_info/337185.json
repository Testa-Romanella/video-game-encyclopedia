You play as an alien who has\u00a0crash landed in the middle of an ancient\u00a0Egyptian city. The Egyptian have mistaken you for a god along with another alien who is also stranded on the\u00a0planet. The other alien doesn't\u00a0take kindly to the you taking attention\u00a0away from them so they release hordes\u00a0of ancient\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0monster augmented with alien technology to destroy\u00a0you and\u00a0the city you've crashed\u00a0in. To defend your self you team up with the Egyptians to create defence tower or turrets which are built from a combination\u00a0of your own and the Egyptian\u00a0technology.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed2/ed200b140aa968a5f37fc061f0a63276.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["George Chandler"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
