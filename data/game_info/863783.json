At its core, this is a very similar game: a multiplayer narrative adventure full of colorful characters and fresh funny dialogues. But this time the goal isn't getting a date, but surviving a road trip (although you still can score a date if you play wisely). <br/><br/>You and up to 3 friends will face all kinds of wacky conflicts, choosing from options in order to manage your road trip resources. If a resource hits zero... you can kiss your trip goodbye!<br/>But fulfill the right requirements and you may reach one of the dreamy destinations that will put an epic end to this experience. <br/><br/><br/><br/>What can you expect from this monstrous road trip?<br/>- The signature style of the Monster Prom franchise: unique, charming characters and irreverent humor <br/>- A co-op narrative adventure with survival mechanics<br/>- You can play with friends both through local and online multiplayer!<br/>- YES! There's still the option of dating. This time flirting is not the core of the game, but you can still get a date with Polly, Scott, or one of the 10+ available hitchhikers by the end of the game!<br/>- TONS of beautiful art like you have never seen before in these series (seriously, there's A LOT of art packed in here)<br/>- Even if it's a co-op game, there's a social competitive aspect that will provide a thrill for the game. Choosing how much to seek your own benefit and how much to focus on the group goal!<br/>- Several brand new characters, and some beloved characters from previous games will be making a comeback! <br/>- Radio stations to choose from, with different music genres to build the perfect mood!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-27T05:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ea/5ea872a15de0474679743dd8d35fa762.jpg", "website": "http://monsterprom.pizza", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 53, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Beautiful Glitch"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Beautiful Glitch"], "esrb_rating": null}
