To prove this, she and her friends\u00a0journey to different areas around Fledge City, gathering evidence, before going to court to fight for her client&#39;s cause.</p>\n<p>Freshly qualified as a defence attorney, Nina&#39;s first few cases go well...\u00a0But when her mentor is imprisoned for a crime she didn&#39;t commit, her career becomes a casualty of a secret war... A war that, unknown to Nina, is connected to her own past.</p>\n<p>A great game is being played for the heart of the city by the ruthless and powerful,\u00a0but right now, Nina doesn&#39;t even know who is playing, much less the rules. She will need to trust her friends and forge new alliances if she is to fight for justice and\u00a0uncover the truth.</p>\n<p>Current state of the project</p>\n<p>NALE is mid-development.\u00a0The case presented in this first version of the game is a courtroom tutorial with a straightforward setup and courtroom battle, and should take approximately 1 hour to complete.<br />\nThe next step is to allow players\u00a0(hopefully you!) to try the game, and see if people want more!<br />\nThis first case is offered for free/name-your-own-price.<br />\nFunds raised will initially go towards the unique assets required to create the future cases, with a long-term goal of replacing all the visual aspects of the game with unique character and environment assets.</p>\n<p>Future Plans</p>\n<p>Future episodes will be sold in an\u00a0episodic manner, where each episode will form a case.\u00a0Future cases will include...</p>\n<p>Exploration of crime scenes<br />\nConversations with witnesses and NPCs<br />\nAn explorable version of Fledge City<br />\nMinigames and puzzles</p>\n<p>Future cases will be based around unique themes that serve as pastiche or parody of popular anime genres and geeky activities; for example, a murder at an underground club for players of a collectible card game, or a theft that will see Nina and her friends get involved in illegal mountain road t\u014dge racing!</p>\n<p>Credits &amp; Special Thanks<br />\nThis game was made by Ethan Fox, who can be found here:<br />\nhttp://by-ethan-fox.tumblr.comhttps://by-ethan-fox.com/https://twitter.com/By_Ethan_Fox<br />\nThanks go to the RPG Maker official forums &amp; subreddit, all of my followers on Twitter &amp; Tumblr, and members of my writer&#39;s Discord,\u00a0The Fiction Addiction.<br />\nAdditionally, this game has a wide range of asset &amp; plugin credits.
