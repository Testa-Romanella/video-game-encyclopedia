Not just in character, you are the character. The part to play is singularly yours. Written just for you.You are met with silence. No barking orders from the director. No call to action that you need to become this version of yourself.

That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.<br />\nDarkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity.<br />\nA deep and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act.<br />\nWhat part will you play?<br />\nGame Features:<br />\nStory-driven exploration - You must explore the world around you.
