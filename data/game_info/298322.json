Once arrived at destination it's\u00a0implicit that he/she will take exams, earn CFUs.</p>\n<p>During the rush a time bar will be shown, measuring the time taken to finish. Each level should be completed in a given time. Exceeding the time the player will face a decreasing of the rewards. Through the levels, players will deal with three different types of rewards.</p>\n<p>CFUs<br/>You earn them at the end of each level. The less time it took you to finish the level, the more credits you get.</p>\n<p>CAFFEINE<br/>Represents stamina.
