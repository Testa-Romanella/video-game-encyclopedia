Didn't manage to bug proof it in time or even finish it, but for the purpose of this jam, here it is. The blackholes and the electric fields\u00a0are harmless in this version (they shouldn't be) and the game is unbeatable. Intended goal was for the player to shoot at the targets displayed on the planet (only works on occasion) and to crash into it. Current version was only exported to windows, sorry :(</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys to move and jump. Z to interact with objects\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T02:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d22fb1009ebefd4398f452c37ddb1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninfar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
