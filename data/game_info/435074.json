As the name suggests, it's a choice-driven game where making certain choices unlocks new and unexpected endings.</p>\n<p>You find yourself in a slowly deranging town amidst a deadly pandemic. The townfolks seem fine at first, but god knows what's in their minds, or worse yet, their breaths?<br/>Watch out for yourself as you'll be engulfed in all kinds of questions. What will I do? Who will I save? Is that a Cybertruck?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't like story-telling games? We also got some minigames intertwined into the main story to best suit your taste.</p>\n<p>Please rate us and leave a comment if you like our game or give us some advices on how to further improve it.</p>\n<p>Follow Team Bacon on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/baconn00/)\u00a0<br/>P/s: Did I mention we got an ingame Cybertruck too?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/15116320f4ad2e58550d6d8919fba59f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team Bacon x Pogo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
