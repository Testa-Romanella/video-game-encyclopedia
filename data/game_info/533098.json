Both crystals are protected by a dragon, the light crystal protected by the dragon Elri, and the dark protected by Cethe. These jewels have, in turn, spawned other jewels that contain powers of their own. Humanity has, over time, learned to harness the power of the jewels, leading to a new age of magic. However, there were those who found themselves dissatisfied with the power they had been given and sought the power of Elri and Cethe\u2019s jewels. One day, an army of humans manages to encroach on Cethe\u2019s domain, and in the battle, the dark jewel is shattered, and its pieces scattered about the world, corrupting wherever they land. However, the Leader of the human army, managed to procure one of the shards before they scattered, amassing great power in the process.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T06:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/8452dc38c20eb434b1fcc0e954c1420f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sragi1914"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
