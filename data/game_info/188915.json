{"id": 188915, "slug": "slotty-church", "name": "Slotty Church", "name_original": "Slotty Church", "description": "<p>Made for Ludum Dare 41<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A combination of Gambling games and Religious Educational game, </strong>which is due to the theme<strong> \"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres\". </strong>Intended to be like the old Wisdom Tree games. The whole \"educational\" bit never came, it would have been simple bible related trivia, like in the old games. I am not religious, I don't mean any disrespect and tried to approach it as Wisdom Tree did back then,which was to basically re-skin games that weren't Christian to start with.<br/></p>\n<p>No sound, no game over screen, and not a lot of fun. It's a slot machine. The plan was to have an upgrade system and make it into an incremental clicker (the Test Of Faiths were in prevision of that) but I mismanaged my time (by thinking that LD was 48h... when did that change?)<br/></p>\n<p>Built on HaxeFlixel, art done in Inkscape and The Gimp 2.</p>\n<p>Edit: I posted a final version at 9:41, to fix a stupid but that stopped all winnings on the 2nd wheel. I left the original sources (which contain a build) posted.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37a/37a132586868db994ddb2b9c8ffd6f28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gutterpunk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
