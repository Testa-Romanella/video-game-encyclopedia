We're soliciting test pilots for the prototype Orbital Station Defense Interceptor, or \"Orbiceptor\" as they're calling it. You've been selected as a candidate and I hope you'll seriously consider the job.</p>\n<p>The Orbiceptor is fast, tough, and equipped with top-of-the-line self-repair systems, plus an experimental salvager that can immediately repurpose technology recovered on-site, at least for a short time. Her primary duty is combat patrol, protecting her space station from any incoming threats by intercepting and annihilating the targets.</p>\n<p>We've prepared three short test missions. We hope your combined performance will recommend each of you for a full commission.</p>\n<p>As a prototype, be prepared for the possibility that some systems are not fully functional. In particular, the customization options traditionally available to a pilot are not yet implemented. Further, I'll be directing your efforts personally, rather than the dulcet tones of our more professional station personnel. I'd especially appreciate a full report of any inadequacies you encounter. We'll need that data to help bring the ship to its maximum combat performance.</p>\n<p>Again, I invite you to try out the Orbiceptor, Captain - I really think you'll appreciate its finer qualities. Thank you for your consideration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f255c5d40661677716e586e3d9b3a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pyrian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
