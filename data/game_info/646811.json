Being the guy who has to <em>paint </em>said balloons while giving them out is even harder.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When your boss refuses to give you the day off despite only having white coloured balloons on the day, you found yourself having to mix colours and manually paint them.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Not only that, but you have to deal\u00a0with impatient customers who give out contradicting orders?\u00a0It's gonna be a long day.</strong></p>\n\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left mouse click to interact with UI and customers <em>(You are able to fully play the game with just the mouse)</em></strong></li><li><strong>Toggle ESC to pause/unpause game<br/></strong></li><li><strong>Keyboard hotkeys<em> (you lose some mouse hovering effects)</em>:\u00a0</strong><ul><li><strong>1,2,3,4 to give balloon to the customer. The numbers correspond to the customer queueing position from left to right.</strong></li><li><strong>Left arrow key, paint balloon red</strong></li><li><strong>Down arrow key, paint balloon blue</strong></li><li><strong>Right arrow key, paint balloon yello</strong></li><li><strong>Up arrow key, pop balloon</strong></li><li><strong>Enter to toggle the cheatsheet<br/><br/></strong></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay instructions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Words with black font -&gt; Give the balloon coloured to what the<em> word says</em></strong></li><li><strong>Coloured words -&gt; Give the balloon coloured based on the<em> colour\u00a0inside </em>the word</strong></li><li><strong>Balloon picture -&gt; Give the balloon according to the colour of the picture</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nInspiration for the game:\r\n<p><strong>I'm terrible when it comes to color mixing. I'm even worse when it comes to the Stroop color test. I thought, why not combine the two things I'm terrible at, that will be great right?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So here we are after one week, this game. Hope anyone playing it has fun!</strong></p>\n\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Programming and design of the game:</strong>\u00a0<strong><em>LapisRaider</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Some art assets, sound effects and animation were created by me.\u00a0<br/>For the assets that aren't created by me,\u00a0\u00a0the credits to the respective creators can be found\u00a0in the file 'credits.txt'.
