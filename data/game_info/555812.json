However, if the Hunter should violate any tenet of their code, they will lose that tenet, and it will weigh on them for all time.\u00a0<br/><br/>Comes with 11 powers available on level-up, with one chosen at first level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T07:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/875d33b18cc112851305129c6a47eb75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taylor Lane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
