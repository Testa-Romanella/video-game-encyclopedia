{"id": 963783, "slug": "scratch-man", "name": "Scratch Man", "name_original": "Scratch Man", "description": "In this 2.5D obstacle dodging game you play as Scratch Man. He is a cat super hero who is on a train home when he encounters his old enemy the Evil Squirrel, who has recently escaped from prison. It is up to you to foil his evil plan and save the (honestly kind of weird) passengers.<br/><br/>At one point you will be knocked off the train and must catch up to it. Scratch Man will start automatically flying towards the train and his progress will be represented by a graphic on screen. During this time you must move him up and down to avoid obstacles being thrown. These obstacles spawn either in the middle, top, or bottom of the right side of the screen. If you are hit too many times it is Game Over and you can try again.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>The passengers of the train have some bizarre things to say, it's worth talking to them.<br/></li><li>Dramatic action cutscenes featuring Scratch Man and the Evil Squirrel.<br/></li><li>Fully voice acted.<br/></li><li>Do dogs get offended if they see you using a lint roller?<br/></li><li>Created by an individual and his friends, bursting at the seams with personality.<br/></li><li>Hard mode has faster obstacles, alternate passenger dialogue, and a secret ending.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T07:03:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/020/0203cc340da58c750e9ac7955f8d1a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lane Gingras"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lane Gingras"], "esrb_rating": null}
