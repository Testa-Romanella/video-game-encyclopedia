Will he be able to truly decimate his mightiest opponent in an epic duel to the death?</p>\n\n<p>\"I Wanna Decimate the Purple Taisa 2\" is a sequel to \"I Wanna Decimate the Purple Taisa\" unlike the first game, this is a collaboration work between myself and Skulldude, he made the platforming segment in the game and I was responsible for developing the boss fight. In total the game length is not very long but it is incredibly difficult, featuring a few screens of platforming and a boss fight with 20 attacks in a randomised order.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/35838c711fc4f733bcd1da94c909c7ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mastermaxify"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
