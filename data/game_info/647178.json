{"id": 647178, "slug": "chromotris", "name": "ChromoTris", "name_original": "ChromoTris", "description": "<p>ChromoTris is similar to Tetris, but with a few modifications. First of all, the shapes that appear in the game\u00a0only contain three squares instead of four. Secondly, the squares have colors that actually affect the gameplay. The\u00a0squares can be either red or blue, and a row will only be deleted if it is both filled and\u00a0uniform in color. There are also things called spreaders that can change the color of existing squares, allowing you to deal with rows that have mixed colors. For more information, this game has a help screen in the settings menu. Note that the controls are somewhat different from the controls in many online Tetris clones, these controls are discussed in the help screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T06:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c983323b4b9d93647653359be48e1a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aleph_Z"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
