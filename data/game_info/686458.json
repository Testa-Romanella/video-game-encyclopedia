You start in a rented building and try to sell as many stickers as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To create your own stickers you can either upload your own images to the game (512 x 512) or use predefined images. You then have to print them out, cut them, package them and send them to the right buyer.</p>\n<p>Orders in your online store always arrive at the start of the day. Depending on the size of the order, you have a certain number of days to process it. The more orders you successfully deliver, the more attention your store gets and more people order more stickers from you.</p>\n<p>But make sure that you don't go bankrupt, otherwise you might have to open a new store and leave the old one behind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T11:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/9826a347de10a32372998d7a33ea9dfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLBGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
