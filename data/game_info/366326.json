Waterfall (Sassafrann\u00e1n)<br/><br/>2,000-2,500 feet long and 5 feet wide, the water falls up into the mountains to a waterfall on a small river in Sassafr\u00e9n\u00e1n, on the southern tip of the island of Sardinia (near the border with Italy). You'll arrive at this waterfall from a small boat you've built yourself on the beach.<br/><br/>3. River-Dike (Sardinian-Nova Truglia)<br/><br/>This dike is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, because it is the oldest continuous river in Sardinia and it has been named this since 1884.
