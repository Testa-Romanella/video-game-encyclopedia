Each maze is randomly generated and uses the colors of your chosen picture to create a visually stunning 3D level.  <br/><br/>To navigate the maze, swipe or tap the screen in the direction you wish to move.  Tilt the device, pinch the screen and use the zoom buttons to help guide you to your goal.  <br/><br/>The game comes included with several images, but it gets more interesting when you use your own pictures.  If your device has a camera, you can also use an image from the camera roll or take a new picture to use in the game.<br/><br/>The free version of this game will test your skills with a 10x10 grid.  If you enjoy this game, consider upgrading to the full version, which provides increasing levels of difficulty and score tracking for each level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T02:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/12296f10ad04a93eadbd471758c3afbb.jpg", "website": "http://www.drumbeatninja.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Drumbeat Ninja"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Drumbeat Ninja"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
