Due to the unexpected departure from my school in the US, I struggled a lot due to the loss of my ability to access equipment and facilities to further develop my game/art projects. I decided to use Bitsy and participate in the Bitsy game jam because not only it is very easy to make a game with Bitsy, it has also been one of personal favorite game-making tools based on my experiences of digital/time based media classes.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:38:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/deb6a0e190d8c95787d27eb2498a3e06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jinhyukl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
