Sadly, you had a ball stuck to you to keep you trapped in jail, and you couldn't get it off. Now Ball will join you as you attempt to escape the long arm of the Green Cube law! If you get to the train, you move to the next level!</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0WASD (or arrow keys)\u00a0to move around, your mouse to look around. Click to shoot (if you have any ammo), and press space to throw Ball towards wherever your mouse is! Killing enemies allows you to gain ammunition.</p>\n<p>I'm going to make a making-of video in the next few weeks, so stay tuned for that! My channel is\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd4A_w8cRj-CU4UWdds8_2A, but I've only posted memes so far :D.</p>\n<p>I was only able to implement 2 levels during the game jam,\u00a0 but had a lot of fun doing so! I could add some more if there is interest, all the ground work is done.</p>\n<p>Theme music (Tequila Starter) by\u00a0Dan Knoflicek.
