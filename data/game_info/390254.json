I abandoned it because at the time it was to complex for me as a solo-dev. I started working on other games and forgot it existed but I wanted to finally upload a game so here its is, my first somewhat playable game:</p>\n\r\nBuild your City\r\n<p>You play as a Lord who is instructed by his king to build a new town somewhere in a mysterious valley. But you are not alone so defend your realm and build a city that will last for a thousand years.</p>\n\r\nFeedback Please\r\n<p>At least that was what I had planned but it turned out as a half-baked city-builder with rarely any depth. But please try it out and give me valuable feedback it really helps to encourage me to make more and better games .</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This game will not be finished and there are a lot of bugs. Please note that I am only 13 Years old and currently working on other projects but once again feedback is always welcome. Even on an abandoned game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:47:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a7dd6fb31f740cfb5cf18468fd15653.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Demaskiert"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
