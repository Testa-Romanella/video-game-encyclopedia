Tilt back for main thrusters.<br/><br/>You must land squarely on a landing pad, green is the easiest, orange middle and red is the most difficult landing pad but will reward with the most points. Beware, if you land on the moon surface and not a pad then the lunar lander will sink and explode!<br/><br/>There are 3 levels of difficulty, on easy you have more fuel and the lander is a little more robust. On difficult, the lander is very fragile with not much fuel on board, however you'll get a stack of points if you land successfully.<br/><br/>The screen will scroll left and right to reveal upto 6 landing pads, although on the more difficult levels you may find some are out of action and you'll need to travel further to find a safe landing place.<br/><br/>Score :-<br/><br/>0 \tYou crashed.<br/><br/>+2000 Well done you landed.<br/>\tThey say any landing you can walk away from was a good landing.<br/>\tNot true here, the lander is too damaged to take off again and there's nowhere to walk to!<br/><br/>+4000 Good Job, Safe landing and will you be able to lift off again.<br/><br/>+5000 Qualified Pilot, nice job.<br/><br/>+7000 Amazing, sign up for the next Mars mission!<br/><br/>10,000+ Space Shuttle Commander, expert!<br/><br/><br/>The following will cause a crash :-<br/><br/>1.
