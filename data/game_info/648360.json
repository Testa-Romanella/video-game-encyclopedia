The player needs to get out of the dungeon with huge chickens. At his disposal only shells bouncing off the walls, a flashlight and what he found in the dungeon (first-aid kits, batteries, keys and special shells). Keys are needed to pass to a new level, first-aid kits for character healing, batteries for a flashlight and special shells to be more efficient resist chickens. These items are very fragile and break at the slightest touch while not in the inventory. The player can save progress at any time and return to it, and after a loss he returns to the beginning of the level.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T06:50:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98c/98c48f52696989d3ed6078b9a085a0c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["arthursosnin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
