An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing Dune II, being released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide the following year. Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy. It has been cited as an inspiration to the developers of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Command &amp; Conquer. It is the sequel to Herzog, which was available on the Japanese MSX and PC-8801 personal computers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f45/f45bdcff5b0e83a5666328d403e5243b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Technosoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Technosoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
