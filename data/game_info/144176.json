Can click on the parts of the circle to initiate swapping of circle pieces.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE FROM DEVELOPER: This game in it's current state is very unpolished. Looking back at it, it was a huge learning experience for me and my former team members. There are numerous bugs, and especially on Android, there are potential issues with in regards on how the game is rendered, and text elements not showing on screen properly. This is due to the high resolution displays and taller aspect ratios for phones today. With how the game is programmed, it will be hard to fix. I might come back to this one day and fix those bugs.</p>\n<p>Current Known Bugs:<br/>- Audio seems to be broken on many levels</p>\n<p>- The level select doesn't seem to update with the last completed puzzle.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd4fede8448b88a2773e0bd4450d92c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Rachel Vancleave @Sindiewen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
