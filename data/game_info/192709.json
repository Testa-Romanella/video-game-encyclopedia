We strive to balance and juggle our lives with its many elements. There are times we can hold everything up and together, and there are many times when we drop or have to let go of things. There are also times when we fall and drop everything, leaving us to pick up the pieces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to select the randomly spawned event shape and drag it onto the player character's hands to stack. Keep selecting and stacking the event shapes trying not to drop any, but like real life be prepared to drop a lot!</p>\n<p>Be patient but also be quick as each shape will react differently and some may react catastrophically and bring everything down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some things when dropped or fumbled may be recovered, but most will fall by the wayside.</p>\n\n<p>This was a tough project to publish without some sort of scoring system as to me all games must have some sort of scoring system, so this was a challenge in changing my perception of what a game entails. As this was a college project and based on a life experience it helped open up my idea of what games could also be. Lifugglar is how I tried so hard to keep things balanced, juggling, trying to keep everything afloat and then various events just came in shattering and tipping the balance, leaving me to pick up the pieces.</p>\n<p>Made with Unity Engine 5.6.1f1 and Visual Studio<br/></p>\n<p>All photos are my own.</p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0freesound.org</p>\n<p>Thank you...</p>\n<ul><li><p>Ambience Composition by\u00a0GeorgKe</p></li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0SFX from freesound.org</p>\n<p>Thank you...</p>\n<ul><li><p>Glass Smash by chewiesmissus</p></li><li><p>Car Crash by squareal</p></li><li><p>Big Block V8 Rev2 by Henaway</p></li><li><p>Baby by skyangel38</p></li><li><p>Laugh-child by Shades</p></li><li><p>I am Death by by nicktermer</p></li><li><p>sw_MoveOutOfTheWayStupid by jppi_stu</p></li><li><p>Good Job Loser by \u00a0epanody</p></li><li><p>Interior Build Work by gaby1729</p></li><li><p>Badge coin win by isteak </p></li><li><p>Congo3_130 by mkoenig</p></li><li><p>Coins_fall_into_coins by Sir Smith</p></li><li><p>Whip Cracks by ArcLegend05</p></li><li><p>Wedding bells by mattew</p></li><li><p>Horror_what_are_you_doing_here_cathedral by klankbeeld</p></li><li><p>Monolith by \u00a0_NOMINAL_</p></li><li><p>Screaming_male_pain by GabrielaUPF</p></li><li><p>Disabled by fons</p></li><li><p>Silent movie OM_24pi by Setuniman</p></li><li><p>Ambieto escritorook by Leossom</p></li><li><p>Vomit by Anko6</p></li><li><p>Happy humming by Topschool</p></li><li><p>Monster behind you by univ_lyon3</p></li><li><p>Jungle Study by jamesabdulrahman</p></li><li><p>Jungle gaming loop by zagi2</p></li><li><p>Angry phone call by vedas</p></li><li><p>Spring Door Stop by acclivity</p></li><li><p>Group of People Cheering by Sirderf</p></li><li><p>Police2 by GuitarGuy1985</p></li></ul>\n<p>Assets from Asset Store:</p>\n<ul><li><p>Flat Icoon &amp; UI -2D Puzzle Game UI by Arisan</p></li><li><p>Bubble Font (Free Version) by Jazz Create Games</p></li><li><p>Lazy Fog by Lemon Spawn</p></li><li><p>Free HDR Sky by ProAssets</p></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d2/6d286b12d17cc4f131857d4b2d5f0296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Not Just Another Gamer!"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
