{"id": 636109, "slug": "dorm-disaster-101", "name": "Dorm Disaster 1.0.1", "name_original": "Dorm Disaster 1.0.1", "description": "<p>You can rate the game for the Indie Tales Game Jam here(https://itch.io/jam/indie-tales-jam/rate/1122188) but keep in mind that this is technically not the game originally submitted. In the original I forgot to make the mesh renderer for the headphones visible and so they're invisible and it's practically impossible(but technically theoretically possible)\u00a0to win. The only difference between this version and the original is the headphones are visible. Also this version is built for downloadable because for some reason the you lose and you win transitions don't work on HTML but they do for downloadable. Idk why; the project file is the exact same, just different platform.</p><p>Remember you can adjust volume in Settings</p>\n<p>This is a 3d platform/puzzle/no genre game where you essentially have to use a grappling hook to get items into a box. It's pretty difficult, so good luck. I recommend starting on Regular with no timer before jumping into Easy, Medium, Hard or Endless. The story goes like this(this is also in the How To Play):\r\n</p>\n<p>You were packing up your college dorm to leave when somehow you were shrunk down to a little tiny ant person! And you still need to pack up your dorm! How will you do it? Thankfully you have a grappling hook. If you fire it you'll either pull your target towards you are be pulled to your target. Get items into the cardboard\u00a0box to score points. Get all 15 items before the timer runs out! In endless mode, items will respawn and your countdown will increase with each item. You can start with any item, but there will be a random suggestion in the top right. Tip: if you're pulling an object, the farther you are from the object the harder you'll pull it. Also, heavier objects are harder to pull. Super Bonus Tip: you can cancel the grappling hook when you're being pulled by jumping\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to Move, Left click to fire the grappling hook, Space to Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>If you're stuck, remember, you can hook to the ceiling to get some height and then you can grab items at an angle. Once they're in the air go to the different sides of the box so the item comes down at the right angle. If there's some you can't find... don't keep reading if you don't want to be spoiled...............last chance...........................I should tell you that you can open certain compartments.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:18:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c446df2d90012f7f532374cdb143f9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StephenSchuster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
