Two opposing forces seek to manipulate the Nerevarine to their advantage. The ruthless, newly crowned King Hlaalu Helseth seeks to firmly establish his authority, while the divine Almalexia is desperate to retain her grasp on the people. The machinations and intrigues of both sides draw the Nerevarine deep into the sewers, caves and ruins under Mournhold, and to a place lost to Tamriel itself.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2002-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-10T21:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ef7/ef74d31932dcb719a1a2d549900dda44.jpg", "website": "http://www.elderscrolls.com", "rating": 4.46, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 28, "beaten": 65, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 65, "suggestions_count": 550, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 65, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Bethesda Game Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
