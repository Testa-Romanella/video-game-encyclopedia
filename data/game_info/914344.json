A computer voice talks to you and gives you instructions. She tells you that you were found in a coma. The simulation is designed to revive you.</p>\n<p>Who are you? How did you get here? Can you survive the simulation? What is this machine that is trying to revive you? Why is it trying to revive you?</p>\n<p>All you know is that you have to place the blocks on the correct pad to get to the next simulation.</p>\n<p>Playtime ~ 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Notes: I'm the original developer of Frame of Reference.\u00a0The game was released on Steam and then\u00a0transferred to another publisher. I bought the rights back and the game is now available for free. There are no changes from the Steam version except for some visual bug fixes. I did refactor the code a little. I tested the final build but please let me know if any bugs slipped through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5a/e5a4af306e695845ebb5442d86d7dd82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omey Salvi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
