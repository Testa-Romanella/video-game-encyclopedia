It started as a means of testing out the concept of layering multiple textures onto a model. After having done that, I\u00a0thought the result had potential to\u00a0be interesting as a fully fledged character creator and perhaps even more.</p>\n<p>The \"game\" is in very early stages. This is the first stable version with all\u00a0the features i initially planned, which I thought I would finally release as a proof of concept and get some feedback. I've got a lot planned for the future and will follow through with expanding and improving it. My main goals as of now are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Overhaul to the UI and lighting system</li><li>More design element options\u00a0and\u00a0consequentially more preset suits</li><li>Optimisation for Android devices (a lot of lag present with current version)</li><li>Better animations/posing</li><li>Basic photo mode</li></ul>\n<p>I really appreciate you checking my project out and would gladly accept any feedback in the discussion board.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br/>-Scrillrock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e7/9e7821e6d35651cff10ba9d2d1c1895f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scrillrock"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
