If you defeat them all, and all the items of the list get deleted, you win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0-You get a +1 life bonus after dropping the enemy life to 0. This will help you prepare to the next one that haves more lifes.</p>\n<p>Beta 3:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0-Added a main menu theme.</p>\n<p>\u00a0-There's a chance of a Health Ball appear falling. If you touch it, you get +1 life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0-When you defeat one enemy, the enemy will hide and the next one with more lifes will appear. This gives a fell of an enemy swarm coming to destroy the Ballz Planet.</p>\n<p>-Beta 3.1: You wont get a extra life after defeating one enemy. This happens because of a bug that gives more life than expected. Your only source of life is Health Ballz.</p>\n<p>Music and SFX made by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:53:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ecc35c56a3f605a9fc43fed3ed95544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["legendfabricio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
