Level design by Liam Ralston.</p>\r\nTask\r\n<p>Your task is to design\u00a0<strong>three levels</strong>. The requirements are:</p>\n<ol><li>Each level should take 2-3 minutes to play.</li><li>The levels should be of increasing difficulty.</li><ol><li>The first level should be a simple introduction to the core mechanics of the game.</li><li>The second and third levels should be more challenging.</li></ol><li>The complete set of levels should include all the elements listed above (although each level can include only a subset). You can also include other components from the 2D Game Kit, but this is not necessary.</li><li>Each level should contain three keys which are used to open the Hub Door and transition to the next level.</li></ol>\n<p>Your design goals are:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Discovery</strong>: The player should learn the mechanics without written instruction (you can assume they already know the control keys). New mechanics should be introduced safely and individually, before the player is expected to use them under pressure and in combination.</li><li><strong>Drama</strong>:\u00a0Each level should be divided into series of encounters that require the player to use their skills to complete a task. The player should have a clear idea of their goals, even if the solution is sometimes challenging to work out.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: The game should challenge the player\u2019s reflexes and problem-solving skills. Each level should have a dramatic arc of modulated difficulty, with moments of tension and relief, and moments of power. The first level should be fairly easy. The later levels should be more demanding.</li><li><strong>Exploration</strong>: Levels should be non-linear, prompting the player to explore in different directions without them getting lost or uncertain what to do next. The player should never have to repeat large sections of the game that don\u2019t present new challenges.</li><li><strong>Sensation</strong>: Basic use of lighting, colour and different tile palettes should be used to give different areas of the game their own character.</li></ol>\r\nDeliverables\r\n<ul><li>A\u00a0<strong>plan</strong>\u00a0of each level drawn either by hand or digitally (<strong>not</strong>\u00a0screenshots from your game) showing the structure you intend to build, annotated with the game elements it contains, and showing the path the player is expected to take through the level.</li><li>A set of\u00a0<strong>storyboards</strong>\u00a0demonstrating the introduction of the game mechanics in level 1.\u00a0 In your story boards\u00a0include the before, during, and after state and demonstrate all aspects of the mechanic, including UI and feedback to the player. An example story board is available on the unit website.</li><li>The\u00a0<strong>Unity project</strong>\u00a0implementing the three levels.</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>design document</strong>\u00a0discussing how your level design achieves all the requirements above, and critiquing any flaws in your design.</li></ul>\n<p>Final result: 90%</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df30869649c7b3e734689fffb995c480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sirmaka"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
