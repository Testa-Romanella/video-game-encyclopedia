After over a year of development (twice as long as we wanted to spend on it), and many pivots (some of which completely changed the game), we decided we needed to take a break from the project. This demo is meant to showcase the part of the game that had the most hours put into it (and ended up being good), the movement mechanics. Please enjoy.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bb/7bbc82cfa0813a0c20d5cea3c1e64070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FurtiveFungi"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
