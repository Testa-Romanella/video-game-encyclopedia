The visual resources were provisional. It is full of bugs and errors and can't be finished. I don't think I got the hang of Adventure Game Studio which was crashing in my computer\u00a0every twenty minutes. I found it on a hard disk and rather than delete it I preferred to upload it here.</p><p>The \"Open\" command doesn't work, so try \"Use\" instead. Other known issues is you need to put the batteries on the flashlight and not the other way aroud and waiting for dialogue to finish or the game crashes.</p><p>I'm really bad at this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:02:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362bd16540398634d19bd75b6cba2311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kelzor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
