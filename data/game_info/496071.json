Lots of failed projects and broken dreams this one has been built atop, and, it doesn't look like much. But it does play, and I\u00a0got to flex some of my design muscles. Which was fun.</p>\n<p>The movement is kinda jank, I'll have to work on getting that to feel better in the future. Protip:\u00a0Jumping increases your acceleration\u00a0 by a lot. Not sure why. But I'll figure that out too.</p>\n<p>I might update this project at some point, with some texture work and additional models. As well as some gameplay tweaks. But the core of it will always remain what it is today:\u00a0Three simple puzzle platforming levels with a kinda fun artstyle.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p><p>Patchnote\u00a0#1<br/></p><p>Thanks to my playtester Rameranic, you can now JUMP on the bed, and also get to level 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/5615625f8249ca607670cb6303b8144a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["graygriffon"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
