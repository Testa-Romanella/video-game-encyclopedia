{"id": 688256, "slug": "striving-survivors", "name": "Striving Survivors", "name_original": "Striving Survivors", "description": "<p>This is a game about managing survivors and fighting with zombies. There are 4 levels.\u00a0One thing that makes this game different is that each survivor has not only Hp but also physical power. Physical power is a resource counted separately for each survivor, and there are two ways of using them. The first one is attacking. Each attack requires physical power, and if the physical power runs out, it takes time for the survivor to recover. And it can be used to transfer the survivors. If the survivor transfers one box on the map, it will cost him some physical power. Physical power will recover also when the survivor doesn't attack or transfer for a while. So during each level, the player can change their arrangement of survivors to win the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T08:30:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1f6a1e0d82fdef68ab35b8f7e37a63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FGSS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
