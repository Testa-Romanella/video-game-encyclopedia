{"id": 664081, "slug": "hungry-horde", "name": "Hungry Horde", "name_original": "Hungry Horde", "description": "<p><strong>Please full screen the game once started :)</strong></p><p>Hungry horde is a game where players take a control of a horde of zombies. You gain points by causing\u00a0 damage to parts of the city. Certain items can only be knocked over if your horde is big enough however. Your hunger is constantly going down and needs to be replenished by eating people around the city. But beware as the bigger your horde the faster the hunger will deplete;</p>\n<p><strong>How it fits the theme:<br/></strong>The theme was you are what you eat. In our game the civilians you \"eat\" become part of the horde you control. So you end up being made up of the people you have eaten.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Use WASD or Arrow keys to control the cursor. The zombies will follow the cursor as best they can. If they get stuck, stopping will usually bring them back to you quicker.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Move the horde around the city knocking over trees, traffic cones ,fences etc. You will get points for all of them. Certain items can only be knocked over if your horde is big enough, so if you cant knock it over get bigger and try come back. The green brain represents your hunger and the game ends when it becomes empty.\u00a0 You can replenish hunger by eating people, but your hunger depletion rate will increase as your horde grows.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>Highscore leaderboard does not work for webgl build.
