It's the loudest word search puzzle ever! With over 1,400 words in a massive 120x120 grid, you'll need to turn it up to eleven!<br/><br/>Use two fingers to scroll around the massive grid, then drag with one finger to highlight a word. Zoom out at any time to see a summary of your progress. <br/><br/>The puzzle is arranged as 16 themed sections, each containing 80-100 words.<br/><br/>To solve the entire thing, you'll cheer on your favourite bands, play the drums, choose a new guitar, run through the back catalogues of The Rolling Stones and Metallica and rock out to classics like Bohemian Rhapsody and Stairway To Heaven.<br/><br/>Earn Game Center achievements along the way and compare your progress to others on the global leaderboard. <br/><br/>Epic Rock Word Search was compiled from user submissions in Word Search Party, also by Lightwood Games. Like our record-besting game Word Search 10K, it has been hand-crafted to form one continuous puzzle with words in every direction. <br/><br/>If you have any questions or comments please send an email to support@lightwoodgames.com.
