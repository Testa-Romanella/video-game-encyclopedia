{"id": 524636, "slug": "atom-oi", "name": "Atom OI", "name_original": "Atom OI", "description": "<p><em>Atom OI</em> is an experimental series of turn-based battles in RPG Maker 2000. Its chief purpose is to explore short-term status ailments as a means of providing defensive support to vulnerable party members by preventing damage. Key features include:<br/></p>\n\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>5 tense, </strong><strong>tactical\u00a0</strong><strong>battles</strong>. A concise experience leaning toward short- and medium-term strategy, <em>Atom OI </em>lasts only long enough to introduce and explore core concepts and aims to wrap up before fatigue sets in.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>- <strong>Thoughtful defensive play</strong>. Every class has a role to play in the party's defense, but the Disruptor makes protection her specialty. What's the biggest source of danger in the fight? How can you best leverage her powers to keep the danger under control? What happens when you can't? These are some of the main questions I wanted to explore with <em>Atom OI</em>'s party.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Also, this one's tough!</strong>\u00a0The value of defensive options is more obvious when death is close at hand, so enemies in <em>Atom OI</em> hit fast and hard. But you have all the tools you need to survive, so take your time, save often, and don't be shy about the \"retry battle with full HP/MP\" option.</p><p>I'm interested in hearing about your experience with this system!
