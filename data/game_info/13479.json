In this hell of a battle you won't be able to solely rely on your weapons. You'll have to use your creativity and set up different traps to survive. <br/>No more bullets? Summon a giant dwarf from the Wizard's hat. Can't push through the walls of enemies? Fly away on a magic elevator. When you feel like there is no escape, pray and an army of crusaders will storm to you on a dope ass tram. <br/>Even if that won't better your situation, you can always choose to run away to the forest where you can chill with Gangsta bears! <br/><br/><strong>Features of the game</strong><br/><br/><ul> <li>the insane atmosphere filled with fun <br/> </li><li>the rapid pace of the game that won't let you break away <br/> </li><li>endless waves of funky enemies<br/> </li><li>the main boss is a glamorous TREX<br/> </li><li>HOT GIRLS</li></ul><br/>Last piece of advice: <strong>DON'T LET THE ALIENS CATCH YOU</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-15T10:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/119/119cf0359403b7a75f480be77780828c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 70, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 3221, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["bch waves studio", "Bogdan Bezgubenko", "Max Bormotov"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BCH waves studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
