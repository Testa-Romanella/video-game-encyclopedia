Thanks for checking it out.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea of the game was, that you have to sacrifice small minions to keep the monster alive. Sadly there is no goal or threat, just have fun with it though!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:47:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b478c08e6593768a2bdecb275ae351ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JOrbits"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
