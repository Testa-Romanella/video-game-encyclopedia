Will the rage of your suffering subjects consume you? Will your health fail you sooner? Whatever fate awaits you, cling to your throne as long as you can!</p>\n<p>Inspired by Hamurabi, <strong>Despot</strong> features revamped mechanics and a layout that resembles Sumerian clay tablets.</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>You are the king of a tiny kingdom in ancient Mesopotamia, with the goal to rule as long as you can.</p>\n<p>There are seven resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peasants</strong> give you labor capacity. The results of their work are received the following year.<ul>\n<li>A peasant can cultivate 1 acre of land.</li>\n<li>A peasant can brew 7 pots of beer from 1 bushel of grain.</li>\n<li>A peasant can be trained as a soldier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Soldiers</strong> can be assigned to military tasks, or discharged to instantly convert them to peasants.<ul>\n<li>A soldier can conquer 1 acre of land, at the cost of his life. The first acre you annex in a given turn is empty, but each additional acre comes with 3 peasants.</li>\n<li>A soldier can be assigned to guard the palace from rebels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Grain</strong> has numerous uses, but rats eat half of the grain left in storage.<ul>\n<li>Each person eats 1 bushel of grain. (Jobless peasants don't get to eat.)</li>\n<li>Brewers need an additional bushel of grain as raw material.</li>\n<li>You use grain to cover your personal expenses, which is inversely proportional to the health you lose.</li>\n<li>Upgrading your palace by 1 level costs its current level in grain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Beer</strong> can improve morale, making the rebels less determined (or drunk), giving an edge to your palace guards for that year.<ul>\n<li>The defense bonus conferred by each pot of beer given away = number of guards / number of starving peasants.</li>\n<li>You can instantly sell 10 pots of beer for 1 bushel of grain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Land</strong> can be cultivated or sold.<ul>\n<li>You can harvest 1-6 bushels of grain per acre, depending on the soil the last flood brought. This also attracts new peasants to your kingdom.</li>\n<li>You can instantly sell an acre of land for 3 bushels of grain.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>palace</strong> level is the maximum number of soldiers you can assign as palace guard. Upgrades take effect the following year.</li>\n<li><strong>Health</strong> is required to stay on the throne.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rebellion mechanics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every starving peasant rebels.</li>\n<li>The total number of rebels that the palace guards kill without taking casualty equals the defense bonus.</li>\n<li>Any remaining rebels kill 1 guard each, dying in the process.</li>\n<li>If less than 0 guards are left, you lose.</li>\n</ul>\r\nNotes\r\n<p>The game won't let you proceed if your plans were to cause your downfall. Eventually, you will have no choice but to restart the game.</p>\n<p>The Toshiba Satellite font is from VileR's font pack.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: the display is a single character matrix that you can select and copy (even though there is no visual feedback from making the selection).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39a27bb97ac19ba616d8d6e3f5ea38cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Undestroyed"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
