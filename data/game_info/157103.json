Using adaptations of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and similar game-theory exercises, the game challenges players\u2019 notions of generosity, selfishness, gratitude, and guile. Time and again, it shows us that rational individuals do not always behave rationally, even when it seems in their interest to do so.</p>\n<strong>Cooperation or Competition?</strong>\n<p>The Aid-or-Raid Challenge lets you sample a common interaction from\u00a0<strong>The Game of Humanity</strong>. This challenge arises in the game when two tribes confront each other along the path through human history. Should they\u00a0<em>cooperate or compete</em>\u00a0\u2014 that is,\u00a0<strong><em>should they aid or raid</em></strong>\u00a0each other? Just as in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, there are benefits and risks to both choices:</p>\n<ul><li>If you and the other tribe\u00a0<strong><em>both choose to aid</em></strong>, you gain 2 Peeps each.</li><li>If you\u00a0<strong><em>both choose to raid</em></strong>, you lose 2 Peeps each.</li><li>But if one aids and one raids,\u00a0<strong><em>the raider takes 3 Peeps from the aider</em></strong>.</li></ul>\n<p>Starting with 5 Peeps, the object is to be the first to 15. You can play against one, two or three other tribes, each of which uses a different strategy.
