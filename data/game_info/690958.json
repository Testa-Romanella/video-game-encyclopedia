However, every object in it sings along the music! Enemies, lasers, even score! An entirely procedurally generated song, made by both the game system and your inputs. Try your best to beat your high score, or just enjoy the music.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> It seems that some sounds don't load properly on the first launch? If the game is suspiciously silent (like not making note when you're shooting), try to reload the page.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><em>Left/Right:</em> Move</li><li><em>Up: </em>Shoot</li><li><em>Down: </em>Shoot on side</li><li><em>Enter:</em> Start game</li></ul>\r\nMentions\r\n<p>Made for the <strong>Video Games Lab Jam 2021</strong>, with theme <em>\u201cArcade</em>\u201d.
