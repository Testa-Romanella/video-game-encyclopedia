If you\u2019re a fan of word making, you should check it out. <br/><br/>The Objective of this game is simple: Try to make as many words as possible from the letters enclosed in the bubbles which are floating upwards. The bubbles are infinite and so are the letters and you can form any English word in any direction even if the letters are not adjacent to each other and so the possibilities of the total words that can be formed are limitless. Swiping across the words seems as if the words are getting sliced and hence the name. But remember to form as many words as possible before the timer runs out.<br/><br/>Features include :-<br/>1) Simple UI <br/>2) Addictive gameplay. Simple to learn but hard to play<br/>3) Cool music and sound effects <br/>4) View your current and high score anytime <br/>5) Nice animation <br/>6) No IAP, universal game and awesome gameplay!<br/><br/>Try it yourself!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de9/de99df5a745817afcd5e89a33a1777c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Aditya Mohata"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
