But in this work, the character can go both ways. So, in the opening scene, those characters are the same person. One goes to the present and future, and another character goes to the past. The character can also go to the right side but, there is only snow because we do not know what will happen in the future. Also, if you keep going right side, at some point, the character will fall down. Like there's always end in our lives. When the character goes left, the character will meet some playable moments. However, after crossing the lake, the character cannot go forward to the right side(present and future).</strong><br/><strong> -collaborated with Jimin Song</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0c3cf353c69d161abd63a9b6da812a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["figjamandnutella"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
