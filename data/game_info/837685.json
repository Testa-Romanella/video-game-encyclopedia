If completed, it would contain every possible combination of 1,312,000 characters, including lower case letters, space, comma, and period. Thus, it would contain every book that ever has been written, and every book that ever could be - including every play, every song, every scientific paper, every legal decision, every constitution, every piece of scripture, and so on. At present it contains all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 104677 books.</p>\n\n<p>You can see source code of a game in this link:<br/></p>\n<p>Github<br/></p>\n<p>I have a lot of ideas on how to improve the game, it is under active development, any of your help, donation or feedback will help me make it better.</p>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, donations through the site do not work for me, if you want to help, contact me on telegram</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Telegram: </strong>@augustfu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T16:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27e58c1e9d3bba286b830ed3d8826a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AugustFU"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
