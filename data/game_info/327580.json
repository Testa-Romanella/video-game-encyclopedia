{"id": 327580, "slug": "flatland-vikinghelmet99", "name": "Flatland (vikinghelmet99)", "name_original": "Flatland (vikinghelmet99)", "description": "<p>A game based on the classic novella by Edwin Abbot,\u00a0<em>Flatland</em>. It was published in 1884 as a work of political criticism by a math teacher in the late Victorian Era,\u00a0 and accidentally inspired a century of forward-thinking physicists. It\u00a0can be read for free here.</p>\n<p>This was built as part of a Metroidvania jam, which has gone on over the past month.\u00a0Typically I\u00a0try and do these in 2.5D to 3D; but I'm still learning the quirks of Godot, and decided that this might just be a fun way to learn 2D platformers.\u00a0 Then, I started thinking about 2D versus 3D, and what it might mean if I went all the way... and this idea was born!</p>\n<p>The game is relatively brief, as I've had a lot going on over the past month. I have it filed in with my other Stand Up\u00a0Games, and if it's reasonably popular, I may return to it and fill it out a bit. The book scripts very well, and many things (rain, Chromatistes, the nature of circles and higher-order polygons, and so forth) would make for great area themes.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You play as the square. Namely, the book's narrator,\u00a0\"A. Square\".</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move<br/><strong>Spacebar</strong> to jump<br/><strong>Drag the Mouse</strong> to use a module (known as a \"Hyperplane\u00a0Module\", denoted by anything that is definitely not 2D and thus, clearly, a hyperdimensional anomaly...)<br/><strong>Roll the Mouse Wheel</strong> to change modules</p>\n<p>As your objective, find the mysterious hyper-circle/sphere that is intersecting with Flatland.</p>\n<p><strong>'L' Down for One Full Second:\u00a0</strong> Return to the last auto-save point.\u00a0The game periodically autosaves, mainly when you reach a critical point. You can also return to this point by dying. Health, location, and hyper-plane modules should be restored.</p>\n<p>(Note: Due to time constraints, there are currently only two ways to get rid of a save file\u2014you can either pass any other save point, or you can clear your cache for this specific page. Either one will replace it.\u00a0I intend to add a save select feature in the future.)</p>\n<p>Music, art, and sound effects are also by me, chiefly with LMMS, Gimp, and Blender 2.8. The artwork might get a touch-up one of these days; maybe a shader to take care of the lack of antialiasing on some of the line art.</p>\n<p>Everybody have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:42:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56a/56ae7324d2744001eb18d18d4a113945.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["vikinghelmet99"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
