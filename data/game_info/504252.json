You don't die, you need not fight anyone, just find the crystal. If you can't, you'll just be stuck in the loop forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make sure you look everywhere for you never where the crystals are hidden. <br/>Good Luck!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>W: Jump</p>\n<p>A: Move Right</p>\n<p>S: Move Left</p>\n\n<p>Note: The sound for the Windows export is a bit glitchy. I am trying to fix the issue though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/278985ceb46140e1dd0dac92536ac0e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AymarX"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
