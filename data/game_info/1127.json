In this world, you can wrap the screen at any time, so that you emerge from the left when exiting right, and falling down a pit turns into falling from the ceiling. Discover a strange world where a man and woman journey through four seasons in a year, constantly separated by the boundaries of the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach new season in the game brings a new twist to screen wrap. Just as you think you\u2019ve mastered a screen wrap mechanic, the world will change its rules and present a new way for you to look at the confines of your screen.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFour Sided Fantasy is a concise puzzle gaming experience that respects your time; an experience that lasts around the same time as Portal.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-25T12:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c502c60e0ebc928df39ef0de13890109.jpg", "website": "http://foursidedfantasy.com/", "rating": 3.09, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 281, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 66, "ratings_count": 11, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Serenity Forge", "Ludo Land"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Serenity Forge"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
