Planets controlled by a team generate starships of that team. The player can control the starships of their team and send them to other planets. If the planet is not captured, the starships capture it. However, if the starships of other teams are present, they need to be destroyed first.</p>\n<p><strong>Github Repository:</strong> https://github.com/EnviloN/SpaceRTS-ECS</p>\r\nCharacteristics\r\n<ul><li><strong>Genre</strong>: RTS\r\n</li><li><strong>Engine</strong>: Unity\r\n</li><li><strong>Environment and Camera</strong>: Pure 2D top-down\r\n</li><li><strong>Objects</strong>: planets, starships, projectiles\r\n</li><li><strong>Actions</strong>: camera movement, unit selection, unit orders\r\n</li><li><strong>Technical mechanics</strong>: <ul><li>Captured planets generate starships over time based on their size.\r\n</li><li>Starships use a flocking algorithm to move around, avoiding planets and collisions between them.\r\n</li><li>Starships use a targeting system that allows them to lock on an  enemy starship and engage in combat. Flocking simulation is affected by  this, and the starship is trying to pursue the locked target.\r\n</li><li>Camera movement is done by controlling a camera rig entity in ECS and its transform is applied to the camera game object.\r\n</li><li>Starships can shoot projectiles that destroy enemy units. The friendly fire is off.\r\n</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nFuture Ideas\r\n<ul><li>Planets can exchange several orbiting spaceships (as a form of currency) for a mining orbiter to increase the starship generation speed. Mining orbiters could potentially be captured or destroyed during the planet's capture. </li><li>Dynamic cursor icon based on game state, selection. </li></ul>\r\nCurrent State\r\n \r\n<p>The player can currently control both teams, so it is more like a  sandbox at the moment. The functionality of planet capturing is not  implemented. Flocking behavior, targeting, and combat systems have been  fully implemented. The same goes for controls and unit selection. <br/></p>\r\nThe project uses an old version of DOTS and thus is obsolete. In the future, I plan to rewrite this project using the new ECS 1.0+. \r\nControls\r\n \r\n<ul><li><strong>Camera Movement:</strong> WASD / Arrow Keys / Drag with Middle Mouse Button \r\n</li><li><strong>Camera Zoom:</strong> Mouse Wheel \r\n</li><li><strong>Camera Movement Boost:</strong> Shift \r\n</li><li><strong>Unit selection:</strong> Left Mouse Button \r\n</li><li><strong>Move selected units:</strong> Right Mouse Button \r\n</li><li><strong>End Game:</strong> Alt + F4 ('This Is the Way')</li></ul>\r\nThe Extreme Version\r\n<p>You can download an 'extreme version' build where the spawn rate of the starships is increased significantly, so you don't need to wait as long in order to induce a massive space battle utilizing the full potential of the ECS design.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T07:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0c251dd8b3ca77f5f7e9394d2eddad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Envilon Script"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
