The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the stage in a best of 5 format. You do this by strategically using your abilities to gain the upper hand. Look out because if you take too long the stages will start to make it easier to fall off with unique stage hazards per stage. If you really want to be flashy you can collect 3 talismans that spawn on the map and cast your ultimate ability for a devastating effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3eccfa3e4df08adebbd3386c674d58f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PrimalKnockout"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
