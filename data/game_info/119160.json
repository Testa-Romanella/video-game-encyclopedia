Is that so hard? Of course if you must do it in songs' rhythm.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 30 tracks divided in sections\u00a0made by 3 different people. First section contains slow and calm tracks to learn how to play. The second one is filled with chiptune tracks that are faster and more complex. The last one is the hardest - electronic dynamic music ranged from 100 to 190 BPM.<br/></p>\n<p>I am really glad I made this thing and I want to thank HATEBIT and A Drop A Day musicians who provided free tracks to community.</p>\n<p>HATEBIT Soundcloud and\u00a0VK pages.</p>\n<p>A Drop A Day\u00a0Soundcloud and\u00a0YT pages.</p>\n<p>Also my twitter\u00a0https://twitter.com/seravlac</p>\n<p>And VK page\u00a0https://vk.com/trisqenta</p>\n<p>I love you all &lt;3</p>\n<p>P.S. Do not close the levels while you playing if you want to save your score. It will be saved automatically when the level is done. Also \"R\" - quick restart!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b8/6b8ee85ceb9779d2048a03c9868431d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calvares"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
