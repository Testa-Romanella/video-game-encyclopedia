What makes it a unique game is its mechanic: When a Black (undead) piece captures a White piece, that White piece turns into a Black one! But don\u2019t worry, all the levels are designed so that you can always win the match.<br />\nYour mission as Leonard, the White King, is to protect the White Kingdom against the marching army of undeads. Elona, the White Queen, is the best warrior in the kingdom, you won\u2019t be able to succeed without her help. During your quest, you will face a sinister reflection that you forgot a long time ago.<br />\nWe currently have a random level generator, which provides you procedural challenges. It creates levels that are challenging enough, but it guarantees you that there is always at least one solution.
