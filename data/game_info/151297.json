When enemies are destroyed by them, they release a small fraction of the Corona's power as an energy shockwave, the same same type your engine runs on. These Coronas can give you a crucial burst of speed to zip around the sector, defending these ancient entities from invaders \u2013 or doom you to a fiery death if you absorb energy than your skills as a pilot can manage.<br/></p><p>This game is intended to be engaging through fostering mastery \u2013 It's not easy to clear a sector while remaining unexploded, let alone to complete it in record time by managing your energy, balancing speed with control. Inspired by the incredible feats of speed runners of classic games, this game is both a tribute to them and a challenge to their skill and determination \u2013 This video is the first in what I hope to be a series of record attempts from me and others, working on clearing sectors faster and faster as our mastery grows.</p><p>First conceived for at the GGJ 2017 \u2013 Corona Defender \u2013 By Luke Thompson, Music by Chime<br/></p><p>Have fun!</p><p>Play Corona Defender here: lukenofurther.games/coro<br/>Or download and launch the Windows .exe file for a less laggy version here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b40/b40dde7b6ffd8c4e4e362b342c440a7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lukenofurther"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
