(You can tell if a point is on the line by whether its color is inverted). <br/></p>\n<p><em>Tip: Stopping the divider directly on top of one or more points will make splitting more forgiving, but mistiming it could be deadly!</em><br/></p>\n<p>When a bad split occurs, one life is lost per pair of unbalanced points. When all lives are lost, the game is over. Otherwise, it continues indefinitely.
