Then you can drag and place anywhere you'd like.</p>\n<p>There's only 10 waves, but you want enough defenders to get passed\u00a0 wave 9 and 10.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun!</p><p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/ToiletWe</p>\n<p>Youtube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/jpet1991</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509ea0c3d15b09341a29a32dc43fb349.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeAreChemicalToilet"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
