Most of the project time could be appropriated to watching coding tutorials on Youtube. I just wanted to give a mention to Brackeys and Code Monkey whose videos really helped me incorporate code and make my game more fun. <br/>Note - I did not copy their code one to one. I used their videos as tutorials but modified the game code myself as most of their code needed modifications to be compatible with the already existing scripts provided for the project.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T01:27:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21e/21efe6986c8abdc736b7a8d23b76bf0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["SuperKrusher"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
