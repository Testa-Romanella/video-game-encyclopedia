Think of a number and answer a series of yes or no questions to reveal you're correct number in just a short time.\u00a0This game is exciting and it will blow your mind.</p>\n<p>This is made in C programming and maybe I can make this as a project in the future.</p>\n<p>You can see my C code in Github Gist:</p>\n<p>https://gist.github.com/Dalmanski/d2691558f9ff4f5fdfd07ad4c6e76aa9</p>\r\nIf the EXE and APK don't work, the First is to download the C Compiler, DevC++ for PC, and CxxDroid for Android. After that, you can copy my code on Github Gist on this Link and paste it on your C Compiler. Maybe it doesn't work on Online C Compiler because of a lack of header and code.\r\n<p>Released on January,28,2023 on GitHub.</p>\r\nUpdate:\r\n01/28/23:\r\n<p>&gt; New interaction that automatically chooses a number from 1 to 31 if your input is 0 or a letter.</p>\n<p>&gt; If you do not press enter after the introduction, it will say \"I told you to press Enter.\"</p>\n<p>&gt; If your answer is not 'yes' or 'no,' it will automatically be interpreted as 'no'.</p>\n<p>&gt; You can try again by inputting 't' while answering yes or no.</p>\r\n01/29/23:\r\n<p>&gt; Reformatted, correcting grammatical errors and adjusting tabs.</p>\n<p>&gt; Added a function to determine the number of digits.</p>\n<p>&gt; Replaced the use of \\t with a for loop for adding spacing based on the number of digits in the last number.</p>\n<p>&gt; Changed the introduction set-up from repeating yes or no to choosing a number from 1 to...?</p>\r\n01/30/23:\r\n<p>&gt; Reformatted, Like changing \"rep2 = geoseq + rep2\" to \"rep2 += geoseq.\"</p>\n<p>&gt; Adjusted the column of the number generation based on the number of digits in the last number.</p>\n<p>&gt; Added a header #include<cstdio> for fflush(stdin), which only works on C compilers like DevC++ and CxxDroid. Other C compilers, especially online C compilers, may not work.</cstdio></p>\r\n01/31/23:\r\n<p>&gt; Added a system to ask if you would like to extend the range or change it. For example, if you input 28, it will ask if you want to extend it to 1 to 31 or keep it 1 to 28 or change it.</p>\n<p>&gt; Added an end text if your answer to 'yes' or 'no' is not found on the number, then the number detected is above the current number.</p>\n<p>&gt; Adjusted the 4 columns again for numbers 31 and below.</p>\r\nSome updates have not been announced yet.
