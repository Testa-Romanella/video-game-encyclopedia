Player still can't leave solar system... working on that today..being able to open a warpgate and leave..\u00a0 uploaded a new version, runs much better</p>\n\n\n<p>Aug 11.. made a small video.. leaving Luna, then through the solar system a bit.. i'm not happy with the solar system bit.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Aug 10</p>\n<p>updating my \"long term project\" trying to do something smaller and more focused. Not much to do now.. Player can \"leave area near Luna\" and fly around a basic \"Solar System\".. not really worth downloading at the moment.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Aug 9.. got some basic bits working.. pretty much kinda rebuilding it from the ground up, but it's much better this way.. some of the scripts i'm updating I wrote a year and a half ago when I was first learning c# and they are very very bad. \u2026 ooh, 400 megs download, that's a lot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aug 08\u00a0</p>\n<p>Journey to Terra.. OK, I got a week.. i'm taking my \"long term project\" and trying to add in some gameplay, story, etc... (again).. I take you back to the year 30,021, just 7 years after the Emperor has asceneded the Golden Throne.. and I give you a ship (just a junky pre-Imperial frigate.. for now.. I mean, It doesn't even work since I took out all the code and I'm starting over, sorta.. (keeping everything that's good, but moving on)</p>\n<p>and here is where I was 1 year ago..\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2d/e2da55825230b797bba7df8bca406780.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DerrickMoore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
