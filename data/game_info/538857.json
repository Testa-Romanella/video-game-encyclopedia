Namely, The mouse cursor does not store its position upon drag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Untitled RPG sets out to mimic the feel and controls of World of Warcraft. There are plans to turn this project into a fully fledge game. Think in terms of a single player World of Warcraft raid encounters.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The idea is to provide a game with the sturdiness and robustness in control, feel, and mechanics as that similar to World of Warcraft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently the character controller is nearly identical to that found in World Of Warcraft 9.0. There are still minor adjustments to be made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The systems built in this project are built with flexibility and versatility. Which means, adding new features will not overlap with others, rather they will extend the current features allowing for quick development time and robustness in game mechanics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy testing the project and following me on this journey to create something big out of it! Any and all feedback is much appreciated. :)</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Jacob Homanics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:23:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/1657b3e01344f570241416a176a7da32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JacobHomanics"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
