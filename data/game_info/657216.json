You accidentally transported to another dimension that you have started calling \"The Chaos Realm\" and now you are trying to escape. Good news, you found a rift to take you back to your own home dimension, The Bureau of Geometric Order. Bad news, three days ago a strange sentient cloud started following you. It doesn't look friendly!</p>\n<p>Play through the five mini story missions to get Deborah home, or play in a typical endless runner fashion and, well run for as long as you can!<br/></p>\n<p>This is my debut into the world of game development and I am happy to present it as my first ever game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credit:</p>\n<p><strong>Backgrounds and Cover Image:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\"https://www.freepik.com/vectors/light\" Light vector created by upklyak - www.freepik.com</p>\n<p>\"https://www.freepik.com/vectors/tree\" Tree vector created by upklyak - www.freepik.com</p>\n<p><strong>Rest of the Art:</strong></p>\n<p>Moon Tribe</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/tiles/2d-tile-pack-f...</p>\n<p><strong>Music: </strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Chase by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Brazilian Street Fight by Punch Deck | https://soundcloud.com/punch-deck\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License\r\n</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0The Sound Of Rain by Sappheiros | https://soundcloud.com/sappheirosmusic\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Music promoted on https://www.chosic.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:34:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fe6c8882cc5d68f61fa7503f1e2516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BirdieMakes"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
