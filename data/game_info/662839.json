This Game, or more like this prototype, was made in 4 days, so it isn't really the best tower defense game. The game is simply said, a bloons td clone. Currently you only have 1 type of tower, the soldier, which you place by dragging him from the right menu onto the field. You can then upgrade these soldiers in the info menu, which you can open by clicking on one. At the bottom of the info menu, there is a card which you can swipe around to get other choises of upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0(The small red number on the enemies represents the damage they have taken)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong> <br/> <em>I used a bunch of kennys free assets, a helicopter sound from freesound.org, a vehicle pack from the asset store and a UI pack from Free Game Assets (GUI, Sprite, Tilesets) on itch io</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b1406314ad3b5d4b23580057196de8df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucky44"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
