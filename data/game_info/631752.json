{"id": 631752, "slug": "abbys-diary", "name": "Abby's Diary", "name_original": "Abby's Diary", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong><br/> </p>\n<p>A story-based, first-person hidden object game. Abby comes home from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt and can't remember anything. Her family doesn't seem to be there anymore. To find out where they are and what happened, she reads her diary. The concept of the game is similar to the search pictures in magazines. Only three-dimensional. The game is divided into four chapters (rooms). Each chapter has two instances: the present and the memory. The connecting link between these\u00a0instances is the diary (trigger: pictures at the end of each chapter). With it you are taken back to the memory. There you take a good look around and try to remember everything. You have only limited time, then you come back to the present. Here you have to search and select what has changed compared to the memory. Once you have found the right combination, the door to the next room opens and the next diary entry is available. The project is a four-person team effort. <br/></p>\n<p>the game is still in development but it is already fully playable. Since the book was written entirely in analog and then scanned, there was no quick way to make a translation. The current version is in German, but this does not prevent you from solving the puzzles.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: contains mentions of suicide, self-harm and violence.<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Instructions:\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>1. the first room contains some background information about the story.

You can turn the page in the book by dragging and dropping on the bottom corners of the page.at the top right there are even bookmarks to jump between chapters<br/></p>\n<p>4. on the last page of the chapter is always a drawing, click on it with the mouse to be transported back in time for a few seconds. look around well in this room too.</p>\n<p>5. after a short time you come back to the present. Now select the objects that have changed. Objects can have disappeared completely, be in different places, exist only in the present or have changed in appearance.<br/></p>\n<p>6. 2-4 objects must be selected at the same time. If you select the wrong object, the door to the next room will not open!</p>\n<p>7. if the correct objects are selected, not only the door opens into the next room, but also the next pages in the diary are unlocked. At the end of these new pages there is again a drawing that takes you back in time.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>System:\u00a0Windows / Mac OS\r\n  </li><li>CPU:\u00a0Intel i3-2100 / AMD FX-6300 @3.1GHz or higher</li><li>RAM:\u00a04 GB   </li><li>GPU:\u00a0GTX 460 / Radeon 6870 / Intel HD Graphics 630  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e4e6c69ac291e6cb2fab9d238e753dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Lenny219"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
