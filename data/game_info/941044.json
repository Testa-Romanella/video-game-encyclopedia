When Jonah runs across a Ninevite they have heard God's saving message and points are scored. Share God's saving message with as many Ninevites as possible.</p>\n<p>Some (major) extra points can also be scored if you help Jonah obtain the King's Proclamation. This can only be gathered once, but once obtained, scores for Ninevites hearing God's saving message double. Hint: Look and listen for an insect, but be careful, it's a fast bug!</p>\n<p>Collect all seven scrolls of Jonah. Upon collection of each scroll a part of Jonah's biblical narrative is displayed.\u00a0Once the 7th scroll is collected, congratulations, Jonah's mission has been completed. Look for an \"Easter egg\" at the completed mission summary. Once a mission has been completed, try again and see if you can beat your score.</p>\n<p><strong>DANGERS &amp; HEALTH</strong></p>\n<p>Avoid the dangers of the various animals or insects. Jump on them to send them to the sands below so they'll leave Jonah alone for a short time and he can continue on his mission. They'll recover and be back though. Look out for the water, Jonah can't swim. ;)</p>\n<p>Each time Jonah touches a danger he loses a heart (his health drops). He can restore hearts or add extra hearts by eating food (bread or fish). Once Jonah's health drops below 1 heart he falls to the sands below and will have to restart his mission. If Jonah goes over the edge of land, he falls of the the sand below and will have to restart his mission.</p>\n<p>The mission ends and is incomplete when Jonah falls to the sands below. If this happens try again and see if you can help him complete his mission.</p>\n<p><strong>AGES</strong></p>\n<p>Kids as young as 6 have been able to play and enjoy the game in my testing, although it's a bit more challenging for those younger kiddos. It can even present a challenge for teens, and, ahem, the adult author depending on how tired he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DEVLOG</strong></p>\n<p>Click here for my Devlog for this game which gives a little background on why I wrote it.</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong></p>\n<p>I did my best to find and eliminate the bugs I could find, well, except for the big flying bug you'll find in the game of course. But I'm sure I've missed some. So, if you find any please report them in the comments below and when I'm able I'll try to track the source down and fix it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/35194b27bcdf344a7ce2c22f6143e6d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["StreetmanGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
