I was hoping to implement an online leaderboard for the game, but didn't have enough time (48 hours goes by too quickly). If I have time in the future I may revisit the game and add that in at a later date.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately I probably won't do another rhythm based game again since I don't feel like it gave me much freedom in the way of game mechanics, but it was still a fun project.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In the game, goats and people are randomly spawned to the beat of the music, and you have to either bless or sacrifice them based on the orientation of the cross (upright = bless humans/sacrifice goats, upside down = bless goats/sacrifice humans).</p>\n<p>Hope you all like it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>F - Bless</p>\n<p>J - Sacrifice</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE(s):</strong></p>\n<p>If the game doesn't seem synced up properly in the browser, try downloading and playing one of the available executables.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d0c4c274eedf5ea415ca26a09ca31c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ben Busby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
