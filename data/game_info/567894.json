I think it's a fun little game though, particularly compared with the others that were around at the time. The game is available to play in the browser as well as a .prg download for playing on real hardware, TheC64 or an emulator.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Fire/Z \u00a0= release a juggling ball into the play area</li><li>Direction/Arrow keys\u00a0= move the juggler</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Bounce eggs (yes, circular eggs...)\u00a0on his arms to keep them in the air</li><li>The closer to his shoulder an egg\u00a0hits, the shallower the bounce angle</li><li>Eggs can bounce on his head, this will give a lower, straight\u00a0bounce but award no points</li><li>Start with 1 or\u00a02 eggs until you get used to the controls</li><li>The more eggs in play when an egg\u00a0is bounced, the more points are scored</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T11:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95ae14553e28e39ee1388f982905b36f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
