You have 4 minutes to scout and rob a house you've never been inside of before. If you're caught, AI will call the police on you.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Every round, the house takes on a new configuration, with different entrances, hallways, and loot.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The Neighbors is currently in Public Alpha, with one playable area and one basic tutorial.<br/><br/>So what's on the horizon?<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>For now, the Alpha is free for the first group of players.
