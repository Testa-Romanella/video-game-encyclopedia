I only had 72 hours to put it together (from scratch), I\u00a0lost the first day looking after my 3YO until 10pm. The theme was \"Trick or Treat\", I've aimed for trick, using size, scale and proportion to trick the player, there may also be the odd Jump Scare lol</p>\n<p>This is only my second ever game jam and second ever game I\u00a0have released.\u00a0 I\u00a0would have liked to have a zombie and skeleton swarm, I\u00a0would have also liked to have given the player the ability to cast magic spells with the wands you are carrying (sorry Checkov...). I ran out of time so wasn't able to do much with lighting or fixing animations etc. Who knows maybe on iteration 2 :)</p>\n\n<p>Overall very happy with how this turned out, definitely my best game so far. I\u00a0need to optimise performance for the Quest build, it runs very smooth via Link cable, FPS drops a bit low without linking Quest to a PC but it's still playable. I have included both Quest and Rift/Quest Link build files. The GitHub repo is publicly available via hyperlink above.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy, I\u00a0appreciate all feedback, I'm a complete novice so everything (good and not so)\u00a0helps!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:38:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00ebe26c01e0190e40c6a736fdb7b080.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kr4yZ33"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
