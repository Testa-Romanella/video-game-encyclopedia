With an interesting cast of characters and creatures, this portion of the story will leave you wanting more! Hopefully.. I think..<br/><br/>Follow the lost knight, Nevaro, as he struggles to regain his power over the troubled land of Yremval, in order to free his enslaved nation from the captivity of the machines.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the early access \"Demo\".<br/>I call it a Demo in quotes because it's basically the first completed quarter of the game. If I wanted to release the game in chapters, I could very well release this demo as its own \"first chapter of four\" within the whole series, as I believe it does well to stand alone as its own fulfilling adventure.</p>\n<p>You should play this game if you like:<br/>-Colorful worlds to explore<br/>-Interesting characters<br/>-Rich story-telling<br/>-Independence left to the player<br/>-Classical top-down exploration RPGs<br/>-\"Steam-Fantasy\"? I think I'll call it that. It's not quite steam-punk.<br/>-Robots<br/>-Knights<br/>-Lore<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89d8c46ae40350d61049e839db14fe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nevaro"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
