Your goal is to write code which will take him to that exit.</p><p>Each level has a set of available low level instructions and a memory limit, each instruction takes 1 B in memory. Instructions are added by drag&amp;dropping them into the code, or by simple clicking on them. You can use right mouse button to delete instructions from code.<br/></p>\n<p>Rate on Ludum Dare</p>\n\n\n<p>Turns out that designing levels for such a simple mechanic can be quite a fun challenge! Over the course of three days we managed to create 16 playable levels. With a help of simple text based level editor we can make twice as much in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, we invite you to try making levels yourself!</p>\r\nAdding custom levels\r\n<p><em>Custom levels are supported only in the desktop version of the game.</em></p>\n<p>To get started, copy-paste the example below to a separate .txt file in CustomLevels directory. The level will be available from main menu. Your level will be reloaded from file each time you open it.</p>\n<p>The format is pretty self-explanatory, but you have to follow it strictly.</p>\n<p>- Use 'O' for empty tiles, '#' for wall tiles, 'E' for exit tile<br/>- PlayerPos and StarPos are specified like this: (row number starting from 0) (column number starting from 0)<br/>- Full list of instructions: `MoveForward MoveBackward MoveLeft MoveRight PlaceWall TurnLeft TurnRight Turn180 Flip`</p>\n\n<p>YourName-01.txt</p>\r\n\r\nName YourName-01\r\nMaxInstructions 8\r\nAllowedInstructions MoveForward MoveBackward MoveLeft MoveRight PlaceWall\r\nScoreConditionInstructions 6\r\nScoreConditionInstructions 5\r\nScoreConditionStar 1\r\nPlayerPos 7 0\r\nStarPos 6 6\r\nDefaultCodeComment // This crystal is so lonely\r\nOOOOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#OOOOOO\r\nO#EOOOOO \r\n\r\n<p>If you will publish your level anywhere - please include your nickname in the title of a file.</p>\n<p>We hope you'll enjoy our game!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music is by Anonymous420, in public domain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T09:08:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc56c8d3d6d3816920e9ba904c459dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Abvadabra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
