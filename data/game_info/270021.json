Play as a man who's superpower is turning invisible... only when he's not being looked at. Try to navigate your player around obstacles and guards while not being able to see yourself. If a guard looks at you though, you become visible and will be caught. Pretty difficult to play to be honest. Features one player and two player modes.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys for movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a32464c133ad46a3ef972316e00e6398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James Longo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
