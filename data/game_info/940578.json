And yes, this also means pieces can go between squares on the board. But pieces are also able to go through other pieces no matter what the piece is AND pieces from can stack up in the same area if the pieces are on the same team. En passent and castling are not allowed and you can suicide by moving your king into the radius of an opponents piece. Also to capture an opponents piece, you have to move one your pieces in a radius the size of a 12th of the width/height of the screen of the piece, you can also capture multiple pieces in one move. To move a piece when it is your turn, click on one your pieces using your mouse and a red circle indicating what places the piece can go should appear, afterwards you move your mouse in the radius created by the red circle and click any key on your keyboard to move the piece there. If you try to move your piece outside the of its\u00a0radius or outside the screen, the piece will not move and nothing will happen. Also, a game ends by one of the players king being captured, whatever team that still has their king wins the game.</p>\n<p>disclaimer: you might get jump scared by the music that plays when the game ends because it can be unexpected.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T10:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/114e3717c4f26dea772fcb59e50d0ba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Samtube007"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
