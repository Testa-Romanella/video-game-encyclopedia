Raise your score by hitting the score raising objects on your way. Watch over your pinballs so you don't run out of them. At the start of the level, you get in the control of a single pinball with which you play and collect points. You can hit point objects with it or lock into special deal positions. You just need to be careful not to lose it by letting it pass by your controllers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPrepare for hazards and clear all the stages!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c66/c6664a73802eb66886581c0722a4f529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zonitron Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zonitron Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
