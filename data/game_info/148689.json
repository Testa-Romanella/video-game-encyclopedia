Pilot the \r\nMK4s nano-ship inside a petri dish against 14 waves of infectious \r\nbacteria as they attempt to destroy the Nucleus, a bio-engineered \r\norganism growing at the center of the dish. Use mines and weapon power \r\nups to defeat increasingly tough bacteria, and collect energy dropped by\r\n vanquished enemies to keep the Nucleus healthy. Or walk a finer line \r\nand use the energy stored in the Nucleus to charge up your weapons, turn\r\n your whole ship into a bullet, or unleash a devastating shockwave to \r\nwipe out all bacteria. The choice is yours, but the Nucleus must \r\nsurvive.</p><p>\r\n\tP-3 Biotic is on greenlight, a\u00a0vote goes a long way, if you vote yes for this game you instantly become the best version of person you can be :D you will also get a steam key for this game if we get greenlit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e4620be6bba6808fdb119573394919.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BatCat Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
