Contains little refernces to SpaceX, Rick&amp;Morty, and one of my favorite games, Outer Wilds.</p>\n<p>\u00b7The game lacks of many things like game saving, bad optimization and\u00a0translation (sorry for that, the text is in Basque, if you want to translate it),\u00a0and the difficulty is a bit unfair. I did what I could at the time :P</p>\n<p>\u00b7The story basically consists of that Steel\u00a0Toad (bad Toad)\u00a0stealed the Grand Star at\u00a0Toad city, and you are the chosen one to recover the Grand Star.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecd/ecd84976244183b2ca7d00e6398609b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mikel Rom\u00e1n"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
