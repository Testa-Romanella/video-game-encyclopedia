The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game uses a more cartoonish art style as opposed to the more realistic style seen in the main Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-13T11:53:49", "background_image": null, "website": "http://www.capcom.co.jp/monsterhunter/pokapoka_airu/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["FromSoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
