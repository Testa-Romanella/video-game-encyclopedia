On the way there, you find yourself facing against more alien bugs.</p>\n<p>Will you reach the base in time?</p>\n\n<p><strong>***PROJECT DETAILS***</strong></p>\n<p>The game/project is supposed to be an entry for GMTK 2021 game jam but I did't finish the prototype in time because of time constraints and other reasons. But here it is!</p>\n\n<p><strong>***GAME DETAILS***</strong></p>\n<p>How is it played? It is best played with a friend/child/brother/sister/partner, one controls the mouse, and keyboard for the other\u00a0(WASD controls).\u00a0But you can also play it alone, if you're also a solo player<strong><em>\u00a0(\u00a0or just alone *tears*)</em></strong></p>\n<p>No audio? yes, because I still haven't learned how to make music yet, or should I say, I couldn't think of music that would fit the theme. It will come, maybe.\u00a0LOL</p>\n<p>Yes it is free, but you can donate. I plan on making 5 levels for this game (maybe 10, if people would be interested in the game.) My pc couldn't handle the development and I couldn't keep on working on this game for long time if nobody would play it, could I?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:30:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9a263360df0402f0c5158b23269e185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blackcatdesigns"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
