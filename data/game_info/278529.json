The game-loop is plant, sell, survive, repeat. </p>\n<p>This is my currently working build. It was a 10 week project for my Associate's Capstone. I\u00a0produced most\u00a0of the art assets (time constraints), designed and programmed all UI elements, and programmed dozens of flexible scripts, including a versatile inventory system, as well as\u00a0planting and harvesting by passing references.<br/></p>\n<p>This is still early, and the current working build.\u00a0<br/>Just completed an overhaul of the Home Base, which is now static, and the player will have his/her own home to customize (This'll be in the next working build).<br/><br/>The updates I'm currently in progress on is rewriting several scripts to optimize and clean up compositions. I'll also begin to implement A* path-finding once I audit all of the code and am ready to move on.</p>\n<p>At the encouragement of my professor, I intend to submit it for the 2019 Boston Indie Festival at MIT\u00a0(BFIG).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82d25b5081574ffcbc6a7539d6fd15ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Sierejko"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
