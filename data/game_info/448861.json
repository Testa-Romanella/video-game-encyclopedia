Look no further! In Casa Acacia you simply create a character, choose the perfect tree for you and start decorating it! On your adventures you can gather building materials and blueprints that unlock new building options!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Arrow keys to move and jump<br/>At home: Hold 1 for menu, hold 2 to build<br/>In the wild: Press 1 to chop wood, press 2 to collect materials<br/><br/>Features I'm hoping to implement in the future:<br/>Gamepad support<br/>Xbox Controller support<br/>Different enemies<br/>More \"events\" to encounter (puzzle/platforming levels)<br/>Stats visible in character selection menu<br/>Mobile version (Android first)<br/>Local multiplayer<br/>Open for more suggestions<br/><br/>Donations would of course help towards implementing these features, but no pressure! This is supposed to be a zen experience after all!<br/><br/>My other game projects can be found here: http://www.wvv-games.com/<br/>You can also support me by buying some merch: https://buy-a-bunny.com/</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Wouter van Vugt<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:19:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/023d307dcdf3ad6bc7cba8a4191ce4c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["woutervanvugt"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
