They would not give the cats names but Chickenpaw\u2019s brother would. He\u2019d call them \u201cpurr-derers\" and even just hearing the name made Chickenpaw shiver.</em></p>\n<p><em>Chickenpaw, however, is not smart. As soon as the small apprentice had gained enough courage, he decided to seek out the so-called \u201cpurr-derers\u201d and figure out why they were so feared amongst the apprentices.</em></p>\n<p><em>The only problem here was that the only cats living on the other side of the border were boring but hostile enemy warriors. Surely they couldn\u2019t be the \"purr-derers\", right?</em><br/></p>\n<p>Take part in Chickenpaw\u2019s adventure as he tries to uncover the secrets of the forest. There are plenty of things to discover - the origins of the horror stories told about the \u201cpurr-derers\u201d, the secrets that Chickenpaw\u2019s clan is hiding from everyone.<br/></p>\r\nYou could...\r\n<ul><li>Get to to know Meadowdance, the shy but wise healer of Chickenpaw's clan, who is getting tired of the constant fighting and problems the warriors cause on their silly little adventures.</li><li>Introduce yourself to the enemy warriors, who are are harder to befriend than a pack of wolves.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Multiple characters that you'll get to know on your adventure.</li><li>A simple battle mechanic.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>[ NOTE: A game created for the game mockup jam.
