{"id": 452739, "slug": "feldspar", "name": "Feldspar", "name_original": "Feldspar", "description": "<p>FELDSPAR is a turn-based board game of strategy, cunning, and guts!</p>\n<p>You and the AI opponent take turns moving pieces and placing blocks on the board<br/>to trap your opponent.</p>\n<p>If your opponent can't move, you win! (and vice-versa)</p>\n<p>Nine different piece types, each with different movement and special abilities:</p>\n<p>- Throw blocks forward or backward<br/>- Teleport other players<br/>- Jump over pieces<br/>- Destroy blocks in your path<br/>- Pick up stars to destroy blocks</p>\n<p>With over 100 levels, FELDSPAR offers hours of replayable fun!</p>\n<p>RULES\r\n</p>\n<p>You're the blue team. You and the red team take turns moving pieces.</p>\n<p>The first player that has no valid moves loses.</p>\n<p>If a player has a King, and the King has no valid moves, that player loses.</p>\n<p>BLOCKS</p>\n<p>Most piece types leave behind a block on the board after moving.</p>\n<p>Pieces cannot move into a block (unless they have a star).</p>\n<p>STARS</p>\n<p>Players can collect a star by capturing it with a piece. Each star captured allows the player to destroy one block.</p>\n<p>Pieces can only destroy blocks that are 4-adjacent to a piece (up, down, left, right). The piece then moves into that square.<br/></p>\n<p>Pieces that fire blocks capture a star if the block lands on it.</p>\n<p>PIECES</p>\n<p><strong>Protinus</strong>:\u00a0Slides like a chess rook, in four directions until it hits a block or another piece. After moving, fires a block in the direction of travel until it hits a block, player, or end of field. If there are no empty squares in front of it, it drops a block in its previous square.</p>\n<p><strong>Recessim</strong>: Same as Protinus but fires a block in the direction opposite travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Regina</strong>:\u00a0Slides like a chess queen, in eight directions. Drops a block in its previous square.</p>\n<p><strong>Claudos</strong>: Moves one square in eight directions, then if not blocked can move an additional square in four directions. Drops a block in its previous square.</p>\n<p><strong>Dissolvo</strong>:\u00a0Moves one square in eight directions. Can teleport an opponent's piece by capturing it. The opponent's piece is moved to a random empty square. The capturing piece takes the square previously held. If no piece was captured, it drops a block in its previous square. Note: If a teleported piece lands on a star, it captures the star.</p>\n<p><strong>Exilio</strong>: Moves one square in four directions. If there is a block in the direction of travel, that block is removed. If not, then a block is either fired in the direction of travel (if there is an empty square) or dropped in the previous square.</p>\n<p><strong>Volito</strong>: Moves exactly two squares in the four directions, and optionally one square to either side. The landing square must be empty, but obstacles in between are ignored.</p>\n<p><strong>Salaco</strong>: Slides like a chess queen, in eight directions. After moving, fires a block in the direction of travel until it hits a block, player, or end of field. Can also teleport any piece in its movement path. If no piece was captured, it drops a block in its previous square.</p>\n<p><strong>King</strong>: Moves one square in eight directions. If a player has a King, and the King has no valid moves, that player loses.</p>\n<p>SCORING</p>\n<p>The winner's score is equal to the number of turns taken (less = better).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/549f60471ff0f851be94bc7fde08e568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sehugg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
