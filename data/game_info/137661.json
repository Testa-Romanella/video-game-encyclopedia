Also zooms and rotates, as would be expected.</p><p>- Pretty decent animations done entirely in code</p><p>- There are lots of interesting and cool ways to combine jump techniques and other mechanics to reach high places. Scaling \"Old Ironcore\" requires very solid knowledge of tools in the ninja's arsenal</p><p>-Place checkpoints anywhere, and never repeat the same section twice! (Unless you forget!)</p><p>- Fast-paced and unique-feeling platforming style including wall running</p><p>-More!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/566/56606c745f451f80e1c51128b0a15975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skelly1324"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
