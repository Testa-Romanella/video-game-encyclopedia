Each captured state grants the player 1 point, and the first to 41 points wins the game! You capture states by moving to them and pressing the Siege key ('S' on the keybord for Player 1 and the 'Y' on the controller for Player 2)</p>\n<p>You move your army by selecting it (left click for player 1 and the 'X' button for Player 2), and then right clicking where you want the soldier to move ('A' button for Player 2). Player 2 can also slow down the speed of his cursor by holding the RT button, and deselect his army by pressing the 'B' button.</p>\n<p>When two armies collide, they will fight each other, and the losing army will suffer casualties. When an army runs out of soldiers, the army dies, and that player won't be able to do anything until it respawns 60 in-game days later.</p>\n<p>Good luck! Your country is counting on you!</p><p>(This game is multiplayer-only.)</p>\n<p>Soldiers Marching sfx by Mike Koenig.</p>\n<p>Also, thanks to Stein Codes. His RTS tutorial series helped me figure out how to make units selectable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T04:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3b/d3b2a825fdc286140d03995af6ab5c0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dan Wolfgang"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
