The theme for the game jam was \"Running Out of Power\", so we came up with this reactor meltdown/button mashing game. This game was made in 72 hours with Matt creating the 3D models and textures, and myself doing all of the programming and creation of the sound effects. Use the mouse and keyboard to move around and interact.</p>\n<p>(Note - The music is from the asset store.)</p>\n<p>We are aware of the elevator bug when you get in and then leave the elevator before the doors close, we are planning an update for release soon.<br/></p>\n<p>04/08/2017 - Untested Mac Build Released.</p><p>04/08/2017 - Version 1.1 released for Windows.</p><p>[V-1.1]<br/>1.
