Even though the game starts off simple, the more levels you complete, the more complex the game gets. <br/><br/>Suddenly you need to conquer levels where you have to create the blocks yourself in the right order, or transport them on conveyor belts, or stack the blocks on top of each other in extra deep craters. It\u2019s a real brain challenge! <br/><br/>The more successful you get, the more money you earn, and this cash can be spent to unlock new skins in the game! Can you complete enough levels to collect them all? <br/><br/>Become the block push master in this oddly satisfying and symmetrical game today \u2014 just push to press that download button!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T15:57:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a490a4e71e051fcc91cd553c9442e8_YduW7dE.jpg", "website": "http://popcore.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Popcore"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Popcore"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
