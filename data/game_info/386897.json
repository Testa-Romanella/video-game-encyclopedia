Start with an empire of dirt and build a legendary tap empire! Each tap will earn you gold to improve your world. Can you build an empire large enough to claim the world?</p>\n<p>Expect improvements over time and new features and better graphics. This is a very basic Idle-like game. I started out experimenting with the progress system and ended up with this. Will add computer support soon. Any feedback or comments are welcome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:28:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4f/f4fa8ba169dd4edf42b02c8cc8b33d0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AVeganPacifist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
