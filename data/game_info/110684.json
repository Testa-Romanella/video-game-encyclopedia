We wanted something that had the difficulty, challenge, and fun of those classic games. We spent a lot of time designing a game that was truly cross platform, and could be played on a mobile device as well as a console.</p><p>What we ended up with is something unique and extremely challenging. NosFURatu currently has a complete World 1 with 21 levels, a mid-boss, and a final boss. Our goal is to finish the game with a total of 5 worlds packed with 105 levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc2ba4002c601c25204d1d6d53958b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sgowen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
