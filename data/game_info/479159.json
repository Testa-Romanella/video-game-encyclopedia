The theme for this Game Jam was: \"Rewind\".<br/></p>\n<p>You can also find our other projects here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\r\nIntro\r\n<p>A Game Jam is a good oppurtunity to learn new mechanics. This time I tried to learn more about Unity's new Input System, URP Forward Renderer and get my hands on something I have abandoned a long time: Human models and animations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it was my first time I creating a game for this genre.</p>\n\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Agent Tempus is a fast paced twin-stick action co-op shooter with a time theme. You can play it locally with as many players as you have input devices. So multiple agents at the same time. This is possible, because the suit allows to switch room-time dimensions. But beware, a bullet can not differ between friend and enemy. Choose your side and keep the back free of the other agents.<br/></p>\n<p>The special element in this game is, if any player gets hit by a bullet, the time rewinds five seconds. This means every shooted bullet, every died enemy or player in this five seconds will come back.</p>\n\r\nMission\r\n<p>The mission is simple: Find and infiltrate the Stem Corp. HQ.</p>\n<p>During your mission you will encounter different enemies with different weapons. Every bullet is lethal. One hit kills you, your friends and your enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So use your dash move to avoid the bullets. If you get hit anyway, the time will rewind and you have another chance. Nevertheless, if you get hit after the rewind a second time before five seconds are over, you will die and the mission failed.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\n<p>Move - WASD/Left Stick<br/>Look - Mouse/Right Stick<br/>Dash - Space/South Button<br/>Shoot - LMB/R2/RT<br/>Reload - auto/R/West Button</p><p>Restart - ESC</p>\n\n\r\nFuture Improvements\r\n<ul><li>advanced AI; you can't call it AI at the moment</li><li>collect and switch weapons</li><li>secondary weapons like grenades</li><li>endless mode</li><li>more story elements</li><li>better performance; due to time restrictions I couldn't really optimize</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Icon and Title is done by Cloud-Jumper05</li><li>Music from Zapsplat</li><li>Programming by Clever AI</li></ul>\n\r\nOther Ideas\r\n<p>I brainstormed a lot and have came up to some interesting ideas, but I could only do one project. So here is a list of other ideas I had for this Game Jam.</p>\n<ul><li>A Meme Is Born</li><li>a game which plays completly backwards</li><li>some game where the level is changing everytime you rewind or die</li><li>build up IKEA furniture, with a time limit; if times up and you're not finished, the game will rewind everything to the start -&gt; psychological horror</li><li>a game with gears</li><li>direct a film as a director; if actor does something wrong, you have to cut/rewind, if not, the film will look awful at the end</li></ul>\n\r\nEpilog\r\n<p>If you have any ideas, criticism or feedback, let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, have fun and go back to the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a78/a788d3b5d92f4c41f1dd57c22a94f59f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CleverAI"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
