Don't look at the Optical Enemy for too long, or you'll start being attacked. Keep an eye on the Freeze\u00a0Enemy to keep them still.\u00a0If the Freeze\u00a0Enemy moves into you, you'll take damage.</p>\n<p>Collecting coins doesn't do anything but make you happy.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>W - Forward</li><li>S - Backward</li><li>A - Left</li><li>D -\u00a0Right</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>Shift - Close Eyes</li><li>Pause - Esc</li></ul>\n<p>If you don't like the controls, you can rebind them in the pause menu.</p>\n<p>(I have no clue if the Linux or Mac builds work properly,\u00a0I apologize if they don't.
