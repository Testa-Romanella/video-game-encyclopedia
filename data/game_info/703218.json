The Naga demands we fly up into heaven and bring Amrita back so he could turn immortal. In the end Garuda meets Vishnu who tells him he can just trick the Naga into trading the Amrita\u00a0for his mom but then make the Amrita\u00a0disappear back to heaven.\u00a0<br/>The Naga then gets mad and chases Garuda. I made it into a 2d platformer.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b860f4010875ca809f11cc09a303ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Broockle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
