{"id": 538435, "slug": "isometric-park-actuallyalys-3", "name": "Isometric Park (actuallyalys <3)", "name_original": "Isometric Park (actuallyalys <3)", "description": "<p>As the director of a small state park, your job is to balance conservation, leisure, and fiscal sustainability. At the moment, you can only move around the map and watch trees grow and die.</p>\n<p>This is inspired by Maxis' Sim series of games, particularly SimSafari, and Chris Sawyer's Tycoon games. Premise-wise, it more closely resembles SimPark, but I never played it except for a demo. (Alternatively, watch 1990's Sim Games. SO GOOD!) </p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the arrow keys or move the mouse to the edges to scroll around on the map. The plus and minus keys zoom in and out. 0 toggles pause.<br/></p>\r\nOverlap with past work\r\n\r\n<p>This game is a total rewrite of the original version in C#. I honestly like the original language and library more (Clojure and Quil), but Quil was starting to struggle with the amount of drawing, and I was hitting the limit of my optimization abilities and available information online. (Another drawback: I also am giving up the browser version, unless people get XNA in the browser working.)<br/></p>\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n<p>Art: Isometric 64x64 Outside Tileset by Yar<br/>Libraries: FNA, SpriteFontPlus, and ImGui.NET<br/>Fonts: Droid Sans, Iosevka<br/></p>\n<p>Watching Thin Matrix's\u00a0 video devlogs for Equilinox inspired me to press on. :)\u00a0Despite some similarities, the design of this game wasn't really inspired by Equilinox. (I've also enjoyed\u00a0 and Thoughtquake's video devlogs for Cargo Defense and Cliff Harris's Democracy 4 video devlogs)<br/></p>\n<p>The original versions used art from the Low Poly Forest Pack by Devil's Work.Shop. (I converted the models into isometric 2D images, using this process.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T04:40:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e182ad406bf77d58d180d01c8572be74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["actuallyalys <3"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
