I'm not a programmer nor do I pretend to be one. I wasn't satisfied at all with brain breaking balls because it only works fine on a MSX TurboR. So I tried to write a similar game playable on an MSX1. \r\n  </p>\n<p>The game works on an MSX1. Please be patient until the game is completely loaded.

Avoid infection by using cell defenses so that the viruses don't get into the cells. Use space &amp; cursor keys to move defenses.
