Their paths intertwine as they struggle against their own regrets and ways, and they must decide which to follow: their hearts, or the status quo.</em></p>\n<p><em>Of Sense and Soul </em>is a story lost to time, centred on two men navigating the smog-covered streets of Victorian London:\u00a0<strong>Hugo Brooks</strong>, a reserved\u00a0editorialist who never adventures far outside the written word, or\u00a0<strong>Seamus Charkham</strong>, a\u00a0confirmed bachelor who would sooner move forward blindfolded than look to the past.</p>\n<p>Both are set in their ways, and both are in desperate need of a change, though loath to admit it. Despite wanting to believe they\u2019re satisfied with continuing on as they have been, they find that sometimes, things can change for the better \u2014 and that the marks we leave on the lives of those around us are so much greater than we realise.</p>\n\n<p><em>Of Sense and Soul</em> is a late-Victorian character-driven slice of life romance visual novel and the first game by Forsythia Productions.\u00a0 It will be available for PC, Windows, and Linux.</p>\n<p>The full release date is to be announced.<br/></p>\n<p>Discord |\u00a0Website\u00a0|\u00a0Twitter\u00a0|\u00a0Tumblr\u00a0|\u00a0Instagram\u00a0|\u00a0Facebook\u00a0|\u00a0Patreon\u00a0|\u00a0Steam</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimers and Content Warnings</strong></p>\n<p><em>Of Sense and Soul</em>\u00a0will be rated 15+, with mentions of alcohol consumption and smoking.\u00a0No graphic themes or imagery will\u00a0be included.</p>\n<p>This is a work of fiction.

Although the setting is intended to be believably historic, <em>our narrative does not display or provide a platform for discrimination</em> of marginalised peoples, moralistic perspectives, or other prejudices of the time.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Will the game be crowdfunded?</strong><p>We have a\u00a0Patreon you can join to support development of OSAS, and a Kickstarter is planned for later in 2023 to fund the full game! Subscribe to our newsletter to be notified when we make the announcement!</p>\n<strong>Will there be voice acting?</strong><p>Partial voice acting is planned for OSAS, consisting of vocalisations for regular gameplay and some fully voiced scenes.
