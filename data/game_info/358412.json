Any crops you run by will be harvested. The more crops you collect in a single run, the higher their values will be multiplied.</p>\n<p>Watch the store in the upper left for new crops and spells to purchase. Newly purchased items will appear as yellow boxes, which you tap to move to and activate. Earn the highest score you can before the time runs out.</p>\n<p>Made by Patrick Kemp.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T08:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d1863e684d52324fc8dcd5f1c109280a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Patrick Kemp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
