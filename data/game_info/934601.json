In Light of Alariya, you traverse the ancient alien temples and ruins to restore the power of the stars and awaken your sleeping civilization.<br/><br/>Alariya was once a quiet and peaceful desert town. Soothsayers foresaw a terrible storm that would last for centuries, so all the townspeople decided to fall asleep until it passed. However, as the world decayed over time, the ancient temples that focused the power of the stars began to crumble leaving the world\u2019s goddess, Ari, with only enough power to wake up one young hero, Rumi. <br/><br/>With Ari\u2019s help, Rumi must realign the Constellation Crystals in each of Alariya\u2019s three Star Temples to give Ari enough power to wake everyone up.  In her exploration, Rumi discovers a series of notes, memories, and murals that help her uncover the mysteries of Alariya.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Single-player, open-world exploration game<br/></li><li>Playtime (main story): 1-2 hours<br/></li><li>Playtime (full exploration): 3-4 hours<br/></li><li>Made in Unreal Engine 5<br/></li><li>Original music score</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-05T09:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b2e6dae9c09c6343a43e680c47586df.jpg", "website": "http://www.lightofalariya.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["SMU Guildhall"], "esrb_rating": null}
