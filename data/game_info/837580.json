The greatest challenges of this project were the AI and ground breaking systems.<br/><br/>The AI enemies had to find the right angle and force when a given wind to land a shot in a enemie mobile. I tried using the Angle of Reach equation to solve this problem, but I realized that firing multiple \"ghost\" shots to find the target was a better approach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Please, try playing this game vs INSTANITY level AI! It's SO FUN!!</p>\n<p>I did all of the programming and art of this game in 2 weeks of my vacation period.</p>\n<p>Please, contact me if you are interested in having a look at the source code of this project.\r\n</p>\n<p>pedroc.sousa@hotmail.com\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4eb/4ebb224cb4c4f122cc7a35365a096416.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pedro Cavalcanti de Sousa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
