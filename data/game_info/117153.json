Robots that were once dormant, awaken and attempt to purge the station of the zombies. you are a lone wolf whos tasked to end the threat for good.</p><p><strong>GamePlay</strong>: The gameplay is similar to traditional FPS games. the zombies differ depending on the type. You have your smaller, fast zombie. your traditional zombie that will speed up when alerted, ala Left 4 Dead, and the heavy zombie that can potentially kill you with one hit. There are also robots that will attack from long range. the combination of the 3 enemies makes this game difficult, but can be defeated with enough strategy... and enough bullets.</p>Updated! Now with more weapons, Less Defects, and More Death. Removed Web Game due to plugin losing support. will be adding Linux build, hopefully adding Mac build as well.<p>Check out the post mortem on Sidefect:</p><p>https://madewith.unity.com/en/stories/one-year-pro...</p><p>Future updates! new level and VR mode for Samsung Gear VR. Development started recently and more will be announced soon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac22f3cb8f900db2fd6ff37dd0ce1130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chillback Digital"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
