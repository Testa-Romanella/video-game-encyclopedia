Flapjack was traveling with his octobuds when one day a cargo ship sailed through the group and separated everyone.</p><p>Now you must help Flapjack traverse the ocean. While before there use to be safety in numbers, now Flapjack must change the colour of his skin to camouflage himself from hungry predators and not upset the oceans many residents.</p><p>Octomix is a proof of concept game I made for my 3rd year university project.</p><p>In theory this game would be playable on a tablet with optional micro-transactions.</p><p>For now I am putting the game here and on my Portfolio Blog for people to download and play it at their leisure. If enough interest is shown I might pursue this idea further.</p><p>Any feedback or donations would be appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/677/67763b6d5c2cf88ada91667e192988ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PoppyMoon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
