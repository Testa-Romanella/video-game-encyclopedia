As Earth\u2019s last defence, players must end the invasion and save Earth by defeating the three major bosses that control the rest of the Remmutors and their reality shifting powers. To achieve this, players must weave and shoot through waves of enemies in space with the arsenal of weapons at their disposal and the powerups they pick up along the way. As the player, you have also gained the means to shift reality as well,\u00a0 however, it is malfunctioning, resulting in it activating at random intervals and causing the weapons you have, the enemies you face, and the game world to change completely against your will.\r\n  With a vivid, retro and neon aesthetic, with frantic and thrilling gameplay to match, Neoblast: Reality Shift will be exciting and action-packed. Master reality and save Earth from its doom!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T18:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/046/0463932ffc9a1301e2da60ec89a19232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mark Auman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
