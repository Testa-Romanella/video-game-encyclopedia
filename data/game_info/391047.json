If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Feature: Weapons</strong><br/>By default, an Axe, a Pistol, a Rifle and a Crossbow come with uSurvival. More melee, ranged, or projectile weapons can be added easily by reusing the example scripts.<br/><br/><strong>Feature: Crafting &amp; Furnace</strong><br/>uSurvival comes with a powerful crafting system. Crafting recipes convert a given set of items to a resulting item with a specified probability of success. Crafting can be used to combine items in all kinds of ways, for example:<br/>\u00a0\u00a0* Banana\u00a0<strong>+</strong>\u00a0Drink\u00a0<strong>=</strong>\u00a0Banana Drink<br/>\u00a0\u00a0* Sword\u00a0<strong>+</strong>\u00a0Handle\u00a0<strong>+</strong>\u00a0Sword Recipe\u00a0<strong>=</strong>\u00a0Sword.<br/><br/>uSurvival also comes with a Furnace system. Place ingredients and fuel into the furnace, then wait for it to cook!<br/><br/><strong>Feature: Energies</strong><br/>Health, Nutrition, Hydration, Temperature and Endurance energies are all implemented by default. uSurvival's energy component can be used for more energies easily.<br/><br/><strong>Feature: Harvesting</strong><br/>Every survival game needs harvesting. uSurvival's built in trees can be chopped down, will drop wood and respawn again. Harvesting can also be used for other resource types like ores, berry bushes and more.<br/><br/><strong>Feature: Interaction</strong><br/>uSurvival comes with an easy to use Interaction component that can be added to prefabs in order to interact with them. For example, the built in doors can be interacted with in order to open and close them.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/989/9893a4cbf60c1b3070da2aef28297f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["T.Y.Brains"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
