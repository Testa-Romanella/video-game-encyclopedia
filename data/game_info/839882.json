You are a WITCH, and you find your perspective compacted to the size of a small handheld!</p>\n<p>This is Atop the Witch's Tower GB, a port of the short, lovely ZZT game by John Thyer to the GBC (with debatable support for the original GB). It also serves as a proof of concept for running ZZT games on the GBC more broadly.</p>\n<p>This project wouldn't have been possible without over two decades of research and toolchain development from the GB homebrew community. Special thanks to the gbdk-2020 team, ISSOtm, Calindro, PinoBatch, and many others who supported me on this journey.<br/></p>\n<p>In addition, I'd like to personally thank the ZZT community  for being awesome, as well as AntonioND for inspiring this <em>tour de force</em> porting project in the first place.</p>\n<p>This is only the beginning of what can be done with ZZT on the GB - stay tuned... or try building something yourself!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef7683366c916bccee7146ce4dee33f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["asie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
