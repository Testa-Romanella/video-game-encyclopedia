There is no end, although there is eventually a cap on planets. <br/>Plants will grow better on planets that closely match their temperature and moisture preference. It costs awe to place a plant onto a planet, but planets produce awe when an individual plants become fully grown. The growth rate (lower number being faster)\u00a0and awe produced per plant are shown on the plant info panel.\u00a0 <br/>Newly spawned worlds may have spawned off screen, you can look for them by moving the camera with wasd. <br/>Created for Kenney Game Jam 2022 - Growth<br/><br/>All art assets and sound effects by Kenney.
