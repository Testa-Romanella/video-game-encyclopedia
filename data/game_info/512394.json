The merchants here would pay a fine price for treasures from the Old World. You know your trusty old ship can take you there, if only you could arrange a few upgrades.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>In Seven Skies, you fill the boots of an adventurous sky pirate captain. At the Tavern, trade your gold for treasure maps. X marks the spot, but most of the sky is uncharted, and you know there will be flying debris and rocks on your way. As you progress, you will meet pirates from all Seven Skies and lay your hands on more lucrative (and dangerous) maps.</p>\n<p>With a map ready, take your ship along your chosen path. You may reveal a tower on your way to the next tile\u2026 or crush into space junk. Manage your fuel and ship durability carefully and head for the mark.</p>\n<p>If you make it back to the Tavern, you may fix up your ship and trade any Old World junk for ship upgrades. You\u2019ll need them for those bigger maps.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s waiting for you at the end of the world?</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Music \u2013 \"'Black Vortex' by Kevin MacLeod (CC BY 3.0)<br/>Leander font by Tension Type<br/>Fire sound by silencyo\"</p>\n<p>Background info:<br/>https://mgackowski.wordpress.com/2020/10/18/rapid-ideation-sprint-part-1/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:21:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b57/b57ea4f3a690e731d46a5d0d6bca86fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nickadance"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
