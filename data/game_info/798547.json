The player is tasked with defeating enemies, navigating dangerous dungeons, and dodging treacherous traps in order to obtain a wide variety of loot, and find the entrance to the next dungeon level, hopefully being one step closer to making their escape.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soulitude\u2019s gameplay follows a rogue-like structure, with the player having to navigate procedurally generated levels to collect treasure whilst fighting through ceaseless hordes of enemies. This is in order to acquire more powerful weapons and armour, and therefore take on bigger threats that the dungeon\u2019s many levels may present to them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the player descends deeper into the dungeon, the power of enemies will exponentially increase, escalating difficulty over time, but also upping the assortment of rare and more powerful loot that can be found along the way. Players venturing into the dungeon\u2019s depths may stumble across various bosses that will stop players in their tracks by burning them to a crisp or smashing them to smithereens, forcing them to start again. Mysteriously back at the dungeon\u2019s entrance. With nowhere to go. Except back down, into the dungeon.\u00a0</p>\r\nThe team\r\nTech\r\n<ul><li>Flinn Fraher</li><li>Thomas Worrell\u00a0</li><li>Harry Reader\u00a0</li><li>Shivam Parab\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nArt\r\n<ul><li>Cheyenne Burdue</li><li>Ben Smith</li><li>Freyja Weller</li><li>Lauren Taylor</li><li>Sam Anderton</li><li>Mateus Lorenc</li><li>Sophie Lambrou</li></ul>\r\nAnimation\r\n<ul><li>Ciaran Procter</li></ul>\r\nDesign\r\n<ul><li>Tyler Timlin</li><li>Callum Brownsmith<br/>\n</li><li>Olivia Cross</li><li>Lindo Nzama<br/>\n</li><li>James Paulson</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T11:47:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd0eee35a4c355f86340acd153fad6c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Worrell", "Reed Developments", "Flinn Fraher", "Tyler Timlin"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
