Fortunately for him, a cat-eared girl named Fuuko appears to save his life. She says she\u2019s a god and that, in order to save him, she put three of the seven fragments of her divine powers into him, and now they\u2019re trapped inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that all wasn\u2019t bad enough, Erika seems to have lost her memories of the accident that nearly took Reiji\u2019s life\u2026 and mysteriously enough, she\u2019s sprouted cat ears of her own! Reiji decides to set that problem to the side for the moment, though, because, as it turns out, not only do gods need all their powers, ordinary people don\u2019t do so well with shards of divinity stuck inside their skulls! Unless Reiji and Fuuko can get the fragments out of Reiji and back where they belong, both of them are doomed to die. Thus, the two join forces to extract the fragments!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, step one of most of Fuuko\u2019s brilliant schemes for getting her powers back is: kill Reiji. She can only think of one one way to safely remove them\u2014shocking Reiji\u2019s heart to its very core. The one silver lining to all this is, their school, Mahiro Academy, is soon to go on summer vacation, so they\u2019ve got a lot of free time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s a life-or-death race against the clock for Reiji and Fuuko!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0982f0006b7554b9a3ab8c7da0652d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 440, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tea", "Sweet"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sekai Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
