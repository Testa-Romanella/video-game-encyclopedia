The main way to tell a member of the society is growing and progressing is the transformation of their members in a ritual called \"Laterappono\" carried periodically by the most ancient members. Since its beginnings the most powerful and respected members of \"Socielatera\" were always the citizens with the most sides shaping their physical body. \"Laterappono\" consists in the transformation of the body to apply one extra side to the body.
