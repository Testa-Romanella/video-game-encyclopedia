OR IS IT JUST A MYTH? You are a highly experienced deep sea explorer. But you search for the lost continent of Atlantis is the trip of a lifetime. It will be the most challenging and dangerous mission of your career. Many unknowns will test your courage, abilities, strengths, and judgment. And you will be using newly designed equipment that's never been tested. The cable attaching the Seeker to the ship Maray is extended to its limit. You have come to rest on a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that ancient myth says leads to the lost city of Atlantis. You have an experimental diving suit designed to protect you from the intense pressure of the deep. You can also cut the Seeker loose and travel further. As agreed, you signal the Maray: \"All systems GO; it's awesome down here.\"\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99f7a6f010a376088e1893f4f95b18f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["codeack"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
