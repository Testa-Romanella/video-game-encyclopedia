By following a strict regimen and reporting your results, you can rise through the ranks, hunt the biggest bounties, and become the Bounty Star\u00a0Black Hole Pilot! Don\u2019t get ahead of yourself though, the key to getting fit is consistency! Work hard, but don\u2019t overdo it. We still need you to hunt these bounties after all! That\u2019s not all though, pilot. Any successful hunts will earn you Pips which you can use to customize your firepower. It\u2019s hard work, but these results are worth it! Get yourself up and moving, pilot, and seize the day! Rep for the Stars!</p>\n<p><em>Bounty Star Fitness </em>is an Arcade style Shoot-em-up with a straightforward fitness workout tie-in. While it's not implemented in this prototype, the idea is to come back every couple of days, choose and complete one of the available workouts, and earn Energy in-game. Energy allows you to take on bounties which reward you with Pips, and Pips allow you to purchase new ship parts from the shop.</p>\n<p><strong>This prototype is only a vertical slice of what the full game could be.</strong> It has the 3 default Workouts and Bounties, a\u00a0few ship parts, and one basic enemy and boss. The star point and ranking systems are implemented, but they have no impact on the gameplay.\u00a0The UI is incomplete and unpolished, but the art style is likely close to final. The gameplay loop is complete and each bounty provides a different level of challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun, and maybe work out a bit along the way.</p>\n\n<p>I made this prototype in Unity for my \"Serious Game Design\" course, where we were tasked with creating games that weren't necessarily for the sole purpose of entertainment. We covered edutainment games, business/economic simulations, and finally, fitness. This is the fitness prototype, so I've incorporated some simple, straightforward fitness routines that mesh into the Energy system in-game. While it may not be a perfect integration, I hope that there's enough here to motivate you to try out keeping a routine going for a little while.</p>\n<p><strong>This game was put together in under two weeks, so it may be buggy and definitely lacks polish! There are also no sound effects or music, so I'd recommend picking out some of your own favorite tunes to play in the background :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T02:30:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20c199319c5fa7bd6b7de9e532d2dae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GogglesKitty"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
