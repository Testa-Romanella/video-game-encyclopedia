This was developed by one\u00a0 person in the span of a month</p>\n<p>Possessed by a evil imp you must collect the soul of your babysitter but first you gotta learn to walk.\u00a0 First you must escape your crib and find a way to murder her before your parents arrive. Maybe even trash the house a bit while Karen is pre -occupied with her damn phone.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to be the most terrible baby you can be. Armed with bodily fluids you gain more points by destroying the house and figuring out how to kill Karen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is currently only one way to kill Karen with plans to add more and no clear way. I plan on adding hints to help the player. So far poison is the only method of killing Karen and you can find the rat poison in between the stove and the kitchen cabinet.</p><p>ROAD MAP UPDATE\u00a0</p><ul><li>First Stability build Feb 8th\u00a0</li><li>Android Build along with minor updates Feb -14th\u00a0</li><li>Feb 29 First Content Update</li></ul>\n<p>Controls\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>W -Move foward</p>\n<p>A&amp;D Left - right</p>\n<p>S-Move back</p>\n<p>Hold E -Certain objects your able to move\u00a0</p><p>Left Mouse Click - To urinate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T02:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82dea3560b87c853e7de856e5eba57d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Paranormal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
