Or, well, a single important block that can attach itself to other, less important, blocks.

Then that game was completely scrapped and this was created in the same project file. The name just stuck around.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5ef562ef2d5b3e84ac80002d8f50922d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Scepheo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
