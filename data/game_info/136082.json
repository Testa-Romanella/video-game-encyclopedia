This is my fourth LudumDare entry as a solo jammer.<br/>Unlike the other three, this one is submitted for the jam due to setbacks and other things that came up during the Jam.<br/>I wanted to do sometime different from my other submissions in terms of style (Medieval and Space) so I tackled the 80s retro style, sort of. The art and most of the code (other than an extension for Unity) is all made by me.<br/>#### Have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>**Description**</strong><br/>Jump on your hoverbike and win all of the stages of the Digital Abyss tournament in this retro-themed Tron inspired game!</p>\n<p><strong>**Controls**</strong><br/>- Arrow Keys | Movement &amp; Menu<br/>- Enter | Dialogue Skip &amp; Menu Option Selection<br/>- ESC | Skip all of the dialogue<br/>- Numeric keys to go to specific levels (for when the game bugs or when youre stuck)</p>\n<p><strong>**Features**</strong><br/>- Tron-like mechanics<br/>- Dialogues (which are completely nonsense :D)<br/>- Two different types of objectives (Eliminate or Collect)<br/>- AI Opponents (AI is a bit fucked though, time constraint :/ )<br/>- A retro feel<br/>- Obstacle courses because why not</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bff835aa735203653f29481619cbf23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TwinGhosts"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
