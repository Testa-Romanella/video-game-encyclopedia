I hope all enjoy the search through this merchant's basement for a life. It is really fun and satisfying with the generation system fully functionally after a bug fix (it stop working 2 hours till publish). Your goal is simply to collect items to improve stats. You can use a sword to stab or throw with your shadow. This is my second Ludum Dare but the other developers first. It was a great learning experience for them.\u00a0 Anyways enjoy Shadow Seekers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/303b57ac8f7c515a3bdbbf4c2222da81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Caveman54"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
