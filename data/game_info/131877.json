Every action at the player's disposal serves at least two purposes.</p>\n<p>The character has a limited number of dash charges that also act as her health. She\u00a0can deflect bullets back at enemies to hurt them and regain a dash charge. By dashing through enemies she also regains a use of her charge. We also demonstrate how dashing can be used to avoid hazards, and how well placed enemies assist in traversal.\u00a0Getting hit looses a dash charge, and getting hit without any charges causes game over.</p>\n<p>This game was built with Unity.
