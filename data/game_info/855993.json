Full credits are in game.\r\n </p>\n<p>This is a single level action roguelike with 23 items, 3 monsters and 3 bosses, and scaling difficulty.\r\n </p>\n<p>You are stranded on an alien planet. The teleporter back home is ready, but activating it will attract unwanted attention.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Jam limitation - Multiuse: </strong>You have no arrow keys. Instead, you shoot to move. The knockback actually applies as long as the mouse is held down, so tap the mouse to move more slowly.</p>\n<p><strong>Jam theme - Turn Up The Heat: </strong>In this game, difficulty scales with time. To win, stay near the teleporter to charge it. You will need to balance the need to explore away from the teleporter for items or vantage points with the fact that difficulty continues to increase whether you\u2019re near the teleporter or not. As the difficulty scales, stronger and more numerous monsters and bosses spawn. Level up and pick up items to increase your stats and out-scale the enemies.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:59:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4aff1eec010459c6171a20ae6cff23a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Trev3lyan", "Althasor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
