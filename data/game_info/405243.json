Pressing shift will allow you to move faster to escape, but will also make the game move faster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My goal was to create a fun game with a risk reward mechanic. I'd tooled around with the idea a bit after a workout with some friends in November, I wrote it down and left it for a while. Over the winter break, I had a few days, so I figured I'd try and bang it out. I'm trying to update it with UI, bug fixes and adding different assets (for materials, mostly). I'm also going to try and compose a small theme and music score.</p>\n<p>Over time, I plan to add screenshots and possibly a short game play video. If anyone finds any bugs, or has anything they'd like to see added, feel free to comment.</p>\n\n<p>This is the beta (I think, I'm not really sure about the naming conventions).</p>\n<p>Update 1/13/20: Bug Fix (Time not resetting)</p>\n<p>Uploaded on 1/12/20</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T05:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185fc1326cceeb89ee5c06670c35e4e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["colstr22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
