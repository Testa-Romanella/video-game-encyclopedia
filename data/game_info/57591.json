This game tests skill in martial arts, and it is not really considered part of Konami's Bemani series, even though it contains music from the series. This game was shipped in a modified Dance Dance Revolution cabinet, with the sensors and the game's art on it. Even though there is the presence of two sets of selection buttons (as Dance Dance Revolution supported two players), this game is one player only. To play the game, one needs to follow the on-screen instructor, and when a red light turns on located on top of the screen, the player must perform the move by repeating the instructor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
