You suspect she's run off into the woods across the street, a bad  habit she does whenever she manages to get a paw out the door behind  your back. The forest wasn't known to be dangerous, quite peaceful in  fact, but her being an indoor pet has you worried regardless. <br/></p>\n<p>Though being an indoor person yourself, you wound up wandering far deeper than you intended. Lucky for you a kind (but odd-looking) stranger stumbled upon you before anything bad happened. <br/></p>\n<p>...Let's hope he only has good intentions in bringing you home.<br/></p>\n<p><em>*The game is intended to be more romance than horror, with a focus on a slow burn relationship with the love interest.<br/></em></p>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Current Demo Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Original Artwork and BGs</li><li>1 Character :)\r\n</li><li>1 Bad \u00a0Ending (sorry)</li><li>Playtime: 20\u00b1 minutes</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Full Game: </strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>More art!!
