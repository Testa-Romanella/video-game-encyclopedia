{"id": 888280, "slug": "fortunato", "name": "Fortunato", "name_original": "Fortunato", "description": "<p>The game can only be played with a VR headset and a pair of controllers.</p>\n<p>Left Thumbstick - Move</p>\n<p>Right Thumbstick - Turn</p>\n<p>Grip - Grab the items, activate switches</p>\n<p>Trigger - Use the cane (Once you get it)</p>\n\n<p>Your main method of perceiving the environment is two small lights attached to the palms of your hands. They are meant to represent the sense of touch. While the majority of the game is dark, you can \"feel\" your way around to navigate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some artificial lights are placed to help you orient yourself in bigger rooms, to make the experience bearable.</p>\n<p>The experience was designed to last about 15 minutes when played normally, up to 30 when explored\u00a0thoroughly.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You've been trapped, and locked away in a dark cellar. With little light, and only your hands to feel around the walls, you will have to find another way out.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Navigate through rooms with puzzles that would be very simple, if only you could see the whole picture... When our vision is limited, we let the imagination finish what is unseen. When facing the unknown, we can only do so much to understand it.\u00a0 We fear the unknown, yet it is not limited to cosmic beings beyond our comprehension. When depraved of senses, things that would normally be easy to understand, will become a mystery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do not consider this game to be a horror, as it lacks some critical aspects of what makes a modern example of the genre. You won't be subjected to tasteless jump scares, or a bogey man chasing you around just to evoke a thrill that is far from a conventional sense of fear.</p>\n<p>This game was made mainly as my first experiment in working with VR. I find the immersion it offers to be perfect for atmospheric experiences, and personally find the end result quite relaxing.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T10:04:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18d/18dc5fe6e6aed3f80ee67f77f7d80696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revenarine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
