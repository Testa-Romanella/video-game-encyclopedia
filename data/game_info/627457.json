You've managed to find a spell that will reanimate skeletons, the only problem is that you forgot to actually check the specifics of the spell, and it turns out it can\u00a0only summon one skeleton that\u00a0isn't under your control, but you still have an idea to make this work. You get better at casting the reanimation spell every time you use it, so you just have to keep trying until you're satisfied with how strong it is,\u00a0and then figure out how to\u00a0get it under your control. but just how strong is strong enough?</p>\n<p>Art and Code: GlerG\u00a0https://glerg.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Sound and Music: Curruff\u00a0https://curruff.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cda/cdaa1b68b9a79a273d012149c8828700.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GlerG", "Curruff"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
