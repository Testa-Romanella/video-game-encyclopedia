Over time the past unusable technologies have been forgotten or scrapped to be used however they could be adapted and humanity has returned to a more simple life. Villages have taken over the areas outside the concrete monstrosities left of the old cities. Books are the only usable reminders of where digitised technology was.\u00a0 Over time some historical researchers have tried to recreate some of the technologies of the past while others have delved into the power within and discovered a connection to \u2018the light\u2019. Combining knowledge of the researchers with the light has led to a new form of transportation. The people that have been successful, the Pilots, can power a form of monorail through the Light rails. </p>\n<p>You play as Ada a trainee in the light who is discovering the story of her world as she escapes the confines of her training academy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T04:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de40d5419ad2fd82609c5592b6537925.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KyojinStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
