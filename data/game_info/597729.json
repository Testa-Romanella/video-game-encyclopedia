But Rory isn't big enough to be queen yet. With the help of Baron Blackbird, Rory must find 9 Magic Treats throughout 3 levels to grow big enough to become Queen... but Dark Magic has created evil enemies that will try to stop you.<br/></p>\n\n<p>I made the game in 48 hours using Construct 3, with hand-painted art made in Photoshop. The music was made by me for a different game. Most of the sound effects are from royalty-free sources. The dog sounds are by Rory herself, recorded on my phone!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1a13f84106b703ec0dccd4b86d722f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheoClarke"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
