The game features 2 private game modes for you and your STEAM friends to play: Team Deathmatch and Castle Defense. In Team Deathmatch, battle in teams of up to 6 players with 60 max players. Fight with sword and shield, bow and arrow, magic books and cannons! Fight friends and enemies alike, as teams are formed in-game. Pick the same team or a different team than your friends, and battle away to see who truly is the last man standing! In Castle Defense mode, play a solo match or in teams. All players fight together to defend the castle and town from waves of AI enemies. Stop the legions from destroying the crystal conductors that channel magic for the town. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nExplore the castle, loot randomly generated weapons, and see if you have what it takes to claim victory for you and your team!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*All game modes are \"private\", hosted locally by you or a friend.
