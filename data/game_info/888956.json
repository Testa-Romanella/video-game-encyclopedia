However, will he still be human by the end of it? Only one person can tell, and that is the handsome narrator who will lead him through this epic!</p>\n<p>No player can get in between the story of this magnificent weaver of tales and certainly not by clicking blue words in a green void!</p>\n<p>A straightforward story with absolutely one ending and no one getting in between this outcome! Transformation? In MY story? I don't know what you're talking about!</p>\n<p><strong><em>...</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Is he gone? Can I finally get a say in here?</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I think he is, good. Thank you for your interest in the Stanley transformable! This is a text adventure all about coming out differently from a situation while battling the narrative of an omniscient narrator! At the moment there are eight endings, but more are underway!</strong></em><strong><em><br/>The game should work on both computers and smart devices, so don't feel afraid to explore! This is my first time publicly posting a text adventure, so I would love to hear your feedback!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah one last thing! You can check out more of my writing over on my furaffinity account!<br/></p>\n<p>Wait, I think a bipedal wolf just walked in here and addressed the reader! I can't have that, that's a fourth wall break! It would ruin the immersion of the reader! Shoo you meddling canine! This is my story, and no one will get in between!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7afedf67590bf0270d5b7770911b3a4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["randomwolfguy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
