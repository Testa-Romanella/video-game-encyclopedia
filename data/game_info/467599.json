The theme of the game jam was \"Out of Control\".\u00a0I've worked on this project alone, with several assets I have from the Unity asset store. The game is made in Unity.</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by other strategy/board games such as GO, Chess, Connect 4, but with a twist. Every time you move, your unit's stats get randomized. I've tried to give the player just enough possibility to plan ahead, but also added some good old RNG to spice things up and get things out of control.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Buttons</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Restart</strong>: Restarts the game</li><li><strong>Rules:</strong> Displays this screen</li></ul>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>UI Elements</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Turn counter:</strong> Shows how many turns have passed since the start of the game</li><li><strong>Turn tracker:</strong> Shows who's turn it is.</li><li><strong>Unit tracker:</strong> Shows what units you have and their current movement pattern.</li><li><strong>Strength table:</strong> Shows which weapon beats which other weapon.</li></ul>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Gameplay</p>\n<ul><li>You and your opponent start the game with 1-3 units</li><li>You each take turns to play (1 move = 1 turn)</li><li>After every move, there's a chance to change the type of weapon <strong>(66% chance to change)</strong></li><li>After every move, there's a chance to change the type of movement the weapon has <strong>(50% chance to change)</strong></li><li>A unit dies, if a unit of stronger type <strong>(see Strength table)</strong>\u00a0steps on the same tile.</li></ul>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>End</p>\n<ul><li>The game ends when someone loses all units.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f72582eacf577bde217f2cb909538660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ganadriel"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
