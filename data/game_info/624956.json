This was a school project that was made over the span of one year that involved students from different disciplines such as programming, game design and 3D modelers and artists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game each player selects a specific elemental character to play as. The basic movement and combat mechanics that all characters share is being able to jump, melee attack and shoot a ranged projectile. However, based on your element your character will have unique skills and traits that if utilized and mastered correctly can assist you in defeating your opponents. At the same time, don't forget that each level has its own characteristics to them, combining your characters traits and abilities with the terrain of the level is essential in outplaying your opponents, so\u00a0 good luck and\u00a0fight and survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>*This game is still in it's beta stage as there are a few bugs that still need to be addressed and also a lot of polish that is still needed.
