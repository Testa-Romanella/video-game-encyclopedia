Every time you collide with an obstacle or fall off the stage, the level is automatically restarted, and when you reach the last level (only two levels at the moment) there is a final screen that allows you to exit the game or try again. <strong>Control is very simple, using only two touch buttons to scroll left or right.</strong> There are no brakes here! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T11:35:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b19ddb2773e2fbe408302a3946e588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["rustyroboz"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
