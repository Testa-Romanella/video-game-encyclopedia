And I don't mean in the puzzle game way - I mean in the self-reflective/philosophical way. My original idea was to have this be like a conversation with an AI, but I figured that I'd make the theme of the monologue about a personal struggle instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c67fffb941f31820d6b149ff2b3b09b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Santtu \"MFG38\" Pesonen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
