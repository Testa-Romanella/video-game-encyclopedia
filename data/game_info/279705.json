No more looking for notches that match... you get to focus on an interesting image and see how the circle puzzle pieces overlap. It's an entirely new puzzle system that you have to try!<br/><br/>We've reinvented the jigsaw in a way that makes the image jump off the page. You assemble the pieces by overlapping circles, just like in a Venn diagram.<br/><br/>You'll be puzzling for hours! Venn has a fully curated selection of puzzles to play, each one in 5 different difficulties!<br/><br/>Venn Turtles contains 36 high quality photos we've picked out ourselves, and we're sure you're going to love them!
