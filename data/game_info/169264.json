I got the idea to make a Chess Game that was not turn based. Since it\u00b4s pretty much Christmas again and the game is just sitting on my computer I decided to release it. <br/></p>\n<p>Fantastic Game pitch:<br/>So: After the 200000000 years this game as existed it can finally be played in its true form. With the help of computer power I was able to remove the element of taking turns and waiting for your opponent to make his move. The computer keeps track of EVERYTHING. Just brute force your way in an kill all the other players pieces and win! <br/><br/>Controls: </p>\n<p>Top Player: <br/>Move: WASD<br/>Next Piece: Q</p>\n<p>Botton Player:<br/>Move: Arrow Keys<br/>Next Piece: Space</p>\n<p>Have fun forever! (or like 5 minutes at least)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01a33fad5eb519d36fe3d065fefaad7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["salkinitzor"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
