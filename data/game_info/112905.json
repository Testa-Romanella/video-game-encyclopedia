{"id": 112905, "slug": "time-heist", "name": "Time Heist", "name_original": "Time Heist", "description": "<p><em>In the year 2004, two engineers by the names of Aaron and Abe accidentally invented a time machine in their garage. Their discovery would eventually lead to a global ban on any and all forms of time travel.</em></p>\n<p><em>That was 20 years ago. You have discovered the remnants of the two's work, and have managed to piece together your very own time-traveling box. So, like any sensible person, you're going to use it to rob a bank.</em></p>\n<p><em>Time Heist </em>is a game created for the 2018 <em>Mashup Jam</em>, inspired/based on the indie movie <em>Primer (2004)</em>, featuring\u00a0a mashup of time travel and stealth mechanics. Navigate 15 levels on your own, with a little help from yourself. And don't worry about any silly paradoxes or anything, those work themselves out. Just get through quickly, efficiently, and leave no loose ends.</p>\n<p><em>Music by\u00a0Ewan Bayne (@plexidotorg)</em></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>Right Click - Interact</li><li>Left Click - Shoot</li><li>Escape - Pause</li><li>R - Restart</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/44038aa25a5d7296a18b4078677fc086.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sciman101"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
