The game requires a good reaction and accuracy.<br/><br/>You control a fast spacecraft among streams of negative energy. Speed is too high and space is beginning to bend and here and there appearing warp zones. Theory of physics in such places is not working as it should. You have to break through these distortions to complete all levels. Prepare to overload!<br/><br/>Pro hint: Touch the walls to increase your multiplier. More multiplier \u2014 more percents \u2014 faster level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T04:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac8a46dc886a993d1739afba16c1473_ERuu6Hv.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/Flytofiji", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Igor Stepanov"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Igor Stepanov"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
