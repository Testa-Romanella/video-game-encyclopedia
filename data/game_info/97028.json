You can play the game on original hardware or on a pc/mac by using an emulator.\u00a0 <br/><br/><strong>AIM OF THE GAME:</strong><br/>The game depicts a hang-glider, Flying Jack, gliding in the sky. While gliding over land and sea, Jack must avoid obstacles on land and in the sky. The only way to defend yourself when enemies are getting to close is to start kicking, and hopefully you can kick down the stunt pilots flying around you.\u00a0As he glides along he must pick up letters in correct order (B first, O second etc.). In the end of the level he must land on a platform.<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/>Control the hanglider with a joystick in port two. Press firebutton to start kicking.<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>Programming by Eric Hilaire<br/>Graphics by Roy Widding<br/>Developed by Megastyle during the period\u00a02016-2018<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br/>Flyboy '64 is based on the arcade game Flyboy aka Fast Freddie from 1982.\u00a0 The commodore 64 version you have here is only a preview, and you are not playing a finished game. Most graphic and code is WIP, and music/sound is not existing. The loading picture (also WIP) displayed on this itch page is not enclosed in the file you can download. As this is a preview, we can not guarantee that the game is free for bugs.<br/><br/>Developing\u00a0 this game was decided to be\u00a0stopped 07.04.2018 due to lack of motivation. The project is cancelled and will not be continued in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want more information about this game, visit\u00a0GTW 64\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873dff1ed1097286a3055407859b25bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
