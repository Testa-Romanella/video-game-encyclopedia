When you run around does the speed feel good ass opposed to the walk? Do you think we need a walk speed at all or maybe just an intermediate jogging speed by default? How does the jump feel?</p>\n<p>2) When moving around the map does it feel to cluttered? Not cluttered enough? (Only 1/4th of the map has foliage currently) Does the overall map size feel good or to large? How do the models look? (both bears and environment)</p>\n<p>3)\u00a0Does the throw trajectory track properly for you?\u00a0Is there anything hard about controlling the aim mechanism?</p>\n<p>4)\u00a0What would you like to see on the HUD?\u00a0We were thinking a campfire level meter as well as a night counter. For menus we are planning on implementing a start menu, pause menu, and game over menu. Are there any additional accessibility features we can include?</p>\n<p>5)\u00a0When playing the game is there anything that stands out? Anything that you think would improve the game overall?\u00a0Any opinion you have helps us fine tune our game!</p>\n<p>Thanks Guys! Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T05:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/05517b9d0373ef96272b3e46a1245e78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IanTHarrison"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
