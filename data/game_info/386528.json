Swap and pop the cute monsters rising from the dungeons below to protect your town!<h3>Not your usual match-3 game!</h3>In Puzzle Patrol, moving your avatar will swap the adjacent monster.<br/>And unlike match-3 games, matched blocks in Puzzle Patrol do not pop automatically. This allows you to setup insane combos! Then pop the matched blocks by simply bumping into them!<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Local multiplayer versus mode, up to 4 players<br/></li><li> Local co-op mode<br/></li><li> Versus AI mode<br/></li><li> Time Attack mode<br/></li><li> Endless mode<br/></li><li> Zen mode<br/></li><li> Steam leaderboards<br/></li><li> Full controller support<br/></li><li> Simple controls (Only 4 arrow keys are needed per player, so you could probably fit 4 players on a single keyboard!)<br/></li><li> 4 different avatar skins to choose from!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/98866471d18aec3880512721379bb5a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iterative Interactive"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iterative Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
