The King of Balandor, wishing to put an end to the war, invites the duke of Faria to his castle to celebrate his daughter&#39;s coming of age. But this celebration is sabotaged by the Magi, a rogue sect seeking to steal the White Knight, an ancient weapon of war sealed beneath Balandor castle, in order to take over the world. During the ensuing chaos, a young man named Leonard accidentally unlocks the power of the White Knight as he attempts to save the princess. With this power, Leonard manages to fend off the Magi attack, but not before they escape with the princess. With the kingdoms in chaos, Leonard is entrusted with the mission to find the Magi and rescue the princess. With the help of his trusted companions, they travel throughout Balandor and beyond on a quest to save the princess before the Magi unlock the other knights. The journey is fraught with danger, with Magi warriors at every turn, mythical beasts and monsters to battle, and forbidden powers revealed. As Leonard learns more about the power of the Knight, he realizes that unsealing all of them could trigger a calamity that could end the world.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2010-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-01T05:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7ba/7ba120e023e432ec315b86ad7b6fb94a.jpg", "website": "http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/shirokishi/", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 10, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 601, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Level 5"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["SCEA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
