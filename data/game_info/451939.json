The goal of the game is to destroy five rows of eleven aliens that move horizontally, as well as vertically, towards the bottom of the screen. The player has an infinite number of rounds. Getting into an alien, the player destroys it, for which he gets points. When destroying aliens, the speed of movement of the remaining ones increases, as well as the rate of sound effects increases. When all the aliens are destroyed, a new, even stronger wave appears, and the player gets one extra life point. The number of new waves of aliens is unlimited, which makes the game endless.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The aliens try to destroy the cannon by shooting at it. When you hit the gun, it is destroyed, and the number of lives is reduced by one unit. If the number of lives becomes zero, the game ends. When at least one of the opponents reaches the bottom of the screen, an alien capture occurs, and the game also ends. Periodically in the upper part of the screen flies \"mystery ship\" (English. mystery ship), for the destruction of which give bonus points. The laser gun is partially protected by several protective bunkers, the number of which differs depending on the version of the game. These bunkers can be destroyed by the player and alien invaders.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T03:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba9/ba9ed144691dac61f9836975fc6ea59a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anonim161"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
