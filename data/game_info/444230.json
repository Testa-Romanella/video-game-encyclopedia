You have 20 $ to bet to a random guy and your objective is not to lose your 20 $ and win the game by getting the 20 $ of the guy. The game also provides a dialogue to make it a bit less boring. The music is proudly made by me (the music sucks). I hope you enjoy this game prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:25:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c0b409d71e9329817c7613fc7b3cf02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KirusoWorks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
