I eventually chose a mathematical game that emphasizes preserving our\u00a0environment, hence cleaning the river. The duck, also the icon of the game, plays an equally important role in shaping the game. I wanted to pass to children the message\u00a0that failure is welcomed -- in fact, they are encouraged to fail!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope that whoever stumbles upon this game enjoys it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click here for the\u00a0Github Repository</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e07d083bbc0c2f6b3f061d4ce287c0c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zineanteoh"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
