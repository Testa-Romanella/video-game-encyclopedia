Blessed with dual magical affinities (fire and air), he has been fawned over, and waited on hand and foot by people all his life.</p>\n<p>He is a rather prideful individual - almost coming off as conceited or standoffish at times. He is also not above flaunting or using his status or wealth against anyone he sees as lower than him (which is pretty much everyone else).\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, deep down, he is just a lonely child wanting to be free. He does not like the fact that his whole life has been decided for him, since he was born. His acts of almost abusing his powers and privileges is his own form of rebellion, against the fate that has been laid out for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite his spoiled prince exterior, he is actually quite the hard worker, and fiercely loyal to his friends and those he trusts. He\u2019s willing to go to any lengths to keep them safe. He can be somewhat gullible/naive at times, due to his sheltered upbringing and lack of understanding of the world beyond the walls of the palace and the academy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gains an interest in Yuuna from her stubborn refusal to bend under the influence of his position as crown prince.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><em>(Place holder picture, will be updated on the second demo)</em></p>\r\nHiroaki Raiji\r\n<p><strong>-The\u00a0\u00a0crown Prince\u2019s older brother-</strong></p>\n<p> The King first born\u00a0from one of the concubines.

Living with an abusive and power hunger mother, all Raiji wanted is to be loved and he will do everything that he can to please her. \u00a0He studied hard and do everything she asked him to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite the harsh treatment he often gets from his mother, Raiji is a sunny boy, he always\u00a0hides his true feelings with his silly smiles and jokes. He never hated his younger brother instead he loved him dearly and spoiled him.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Until one day he met with Yuuna, at first, he didn\u2019t like on how she defies Jun. But soon he started to get attracted on how open she is in expressing her feelings.
