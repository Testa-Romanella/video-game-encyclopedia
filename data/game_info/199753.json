Kostya.</p>\n\n\n<p>Kostya?\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Kostya Korobkin</strong>, very nice, get acquainted!\u00a0<br/><br/>And also\u00a0<strong>Crazy Dave\u00a0</strong>!!!\u00a0<br/><br/>How ? You do not know Crazy Dave ??? !!!\u00a0<br/><br/>Well, it could well be. And it's okay.\u00a0<br/><br/>And yet\u00a0<strong>Kostya Korobkin\u00a0</strong>invited him to his place On a visit.\u00a0<br/>So,\u00a0<strong>Crazy Dave\u00a0</strong>visiting Kostya.\u00a0<br/><br/>And everything would be good if it were not for the ill-fated history.\u00a0<br/><br/>First, Dave ran out of seeds.\u00a0<br/><br/>Secondly, the last\u00a0<strong>Peashooter\u00a0</strong>, which began\u00a0<br/>Shoot some strange seeds after from it\u00a0<br/>Accidentally flew some more strange pea.\u00a0<br/><br/>That's the story!\u00a0<br/><br/>Still, after that he began to shoot such seeds that Kostya\u00a0<br/>Had to dodge them, so as not to turn ... yes, yes,\u00a0<br/>In the ZOMBI!\u00a0<br/><br/>And the blame for everything\u00a0<strong>Green\u00a0</strong>.\u00a0<br/><br/>The messenger of other worlds. Or simply\u00a0<strong>Green ball\u00a0</strong>.\u00a0<br/><br/>With good intentions, he came to our planet and how it turned out,\u00a0<br/>That he flew out of Dave's Peashooter, the story is silent.\u00a0<br/>And very sensible.\u00a0<br/><br/>But the fact that two more came to the Earth after him -\u00a0<br/><br/>In the image of Pencil and Paper is no longer in doubt.\u00a0<br/><br/>As the beginning began (yes, that's exactly what I wanted to say!), Chaos of the universal scale.\u00a0<br/><br/>And do you know why?\u00a0<br/><br/>Because this \"sweet couple\" is able to materialize everything that Will see.\u00a0<br/><br/>For this, Pencil simply paints it on Paper and ...\u00a0<br/><br/>It arises in reality.\u00a0<br/><br/>So they materialized the first Petka and Chapay they got.\u00a0<br/><br/>And then - more ...\u00a0<br/><br/>What will happen after I do not know.\u00a0<br/><br/>But most likely nothing good.\u00a0<br/><br/>That's why you need to urgently take this matter in your hands,\u00a0<br/>Armed with a mouse.\u00a0<br/><br/>You will be helped or ... will interfere with universal scales of extraterrestrial intelligence -\u00a0<br/>PLANET OF THE BOL.\u00a0<br/><br/>And Pencil and Paper accidentally in the hands of a magazine of erotic content<br/>And they certainly materialize the sexy beauty of Bridge.\u00a0<br/><br/>They carry them to a sultry island in the ocean, where Green happened to be the case.\u00a0<br/><br/>In general, imagine. So, the Island, Bridget, the sea, and the hot sun.
