As you could tell from the design of the game, I tried to make simple rooms that would lead the player to the next story beat without taking too much time going between each room. The player should be able to quickly see what items they need to collect, without getting lost or confused about where to go. While we can\u2019t quite translate a stellar chase scene into Bitsy, I tried my best to use the passage of time to show how the player progresses throughout the story. While their lines are limited, I wanted to take into account McCloud\u2019s words on combining pictures and words (pg.152) by giving more personality to the characters through their dialogue, and providing a history to the world through the notes left in the colosseum. Overall, Understanding Comics gave me better understanding of how to incorporate dialogue in comics, though I feel as if I couldn\u2019t quite incorporate McCloud\u2019s teachings on how the story is affected by the art.\r\n  </p>\n<p>One of the most noteworthy topics of the lessons on theme parks was the focus on ambience and the emotions evoked in the guests from the entrance, throughout the park, and right up to their exit from the park. What resonated with me the most was their insistence on immersion, the way they incorporated everything from the crew to the park\u2019s facilities for the sake of their immersion showed a serious commitment and dedication to their craft as well as to their narrative. For my game, instead of committing to the setting I wanted to convey a laid back comedic approach. From the guards to the items, I chose to aim for laughs rather than the serious tone of the subject matter, being stuck in the past and forced into a battle to the death. The majority of the guards behave and look the same way in order to further the story, they needed to be simple enough not to draw any attention or demand any backstory. Even though the guards were simple enough I at least wanted to provide a background for one of the gladiators, so I chose to include notes left behind as the last words of other dead gladiators, who all lost to the scared, meek seeming gladiator.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:13:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/2698f21cfb7339f32b9edc597348f49e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eldritch T"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
