You are stranded on a planet full of killer plants. The plants used to grow by starlight, but one day the stars fell out of the sky. Without the stars' light, the plants began emitting toxic spores and turned evil. Only you can help find the stars and return them to the Plant God to restore peace on their planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Grunge Bot\" by Eric Matyas</p>\n<p>\"The Creeping Blob\" by Eric Matyas</p>\n<p>\"Urban Jungle\" by Eric Matyas</p>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>\n<p>Skybox add-on - Eclypso</p>\n<p>Cartoon FX free - Jean Moreno (JMO)</p>\n<p>CastlePack_3D environment - Kinitia Studios</p>\n<p>Street Bench - Pixel Studios</p>\n<p>TinyFire VFX 1.0 - Twelve</p>\n<p>Low Poly Tree Pack - BrokenVector</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f87fe973127bf0956f297822f72aa26e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anikae2"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
