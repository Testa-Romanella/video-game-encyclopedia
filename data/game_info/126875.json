It should suffice to understand... the quality.</p><p>No, kidding. I started this visual novel for Nanoreno 2017. It's a story I'd planned in my heart since I was in my teens, although it underwent a lot of changes since those times. Now it deals with heavy themes and a lot of seriousness. But it's lighthearted. It's difficult to explain but basically, it's the story of a pro gamer, her troubles and how she ended up becoming homeless. It's the story of a frustrated sales clerk at Gamepot aswell, who meets the weird girl aforementioned and these two end up becoming friends.</p><p>It's really difficult to explain.</p><p> Although it's still in early development stages (3 chapters out of 10, not to mention the bad endings etc.) I do expect to finish it and since it's all planned, hopefully I'll see y'all enjoying it ~ &lt;3  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f1ed4aae38ff0180e58adf3aeff31ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lychee Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
