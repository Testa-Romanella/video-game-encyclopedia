We had a lot of fun making it and will likely try to polish it up. We tried to make a game where the gun transforms based on how you play. The gun changes shape, color, damage, fire rate, and even boosts your health, speed, and jumping capability. There are fire tiers of upgrades for long, medium, and close range shots. The ESC key quits the game. We created all of the assets ourselves.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to share any thoughts about the game.\u00a0Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37fb3deb0db750a4b98ce83757d275f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnclePhilldo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
