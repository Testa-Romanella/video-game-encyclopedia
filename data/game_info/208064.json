All you get at the beggining is a blueprint, find materials and build a new rocket (from the bottom of a \"recipe\"). You can have only 3 items with you! Leave other materials near the workbench and use them when you need it.</p><ul><li><strong>Tech</strong>:</li></ul><p>This game is playable only on Windows.\u00a0</p><p>Keyboard Controls:</p><p>Arrow Keys / WASD - Move</p><p>Space - Look at the blueprint, leave/use materials, launch the rocket!<br/></p><p>Esc/'P' - Close the blueprint window</p><ul><li><strong>From the creators</strong>:</li></ul><p>Creating this game gave us tonns of fun.
