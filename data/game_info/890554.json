What is your name?\"</p>\n<p><strong>\"Pong.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jane Pong.\"</strong></p>\n<p>==============================</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is simply to escape the place, which means you'll have to bounce your way out of there!</p>\n<p>Create walls around you to move, collect keys and defeat two bosses to complete your mission!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- Arrows: create walls on the side you pressed to bounce on them (Left arrow = create a wall on your left)<br/>- Backspace: suicide and return to the latest safe area.</p>\n<p>==============================</p>\n<p>Phew! Well, I didn't have a lot of time to work on this game this week, as I was a bit sick and out of motivation, but I did put some work this Saturday to somehow wrap it up, with a lot of planned content removed.<br/>Hope you'll enjoy this silly take on \"Pong\"! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T08:30:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a6790650bd230106d3301d08ac9a500b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linky439"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
