Sasha is determined to cross the River Styx without paying the fare. They have the money but who knows what cool arcades they have in the afterlife? Not Sasha!</p>\n<p>You play as Sasha Eyelegs, a recently deceased spirit attempting to cross the River Styx without paying the fare.</p>\n<p>Use 'A' and 'D' to move forwards and backwards and 'S' and 'W' to move left and right (this is not used much. There are a few collectables towards the end that require you to move around the platform). Press the spacebar to jump and spam the spacebar to fly. Press 'E' to interact with objects (currently only needed for the lift system).</p>\n<p>What would be the end of the game is currently just a box blocking you from going further. This game is in very early aplha so feeback on the level design, gameplay, etc is beyond appreciated! Let me know how I can make the game better!!</p>\n<p>Music by Jacob Keating</p>\n<p>Wood textures:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/wood/stylized-wood-t...</p>\n<p>Stone texture: https://www.sharecg.com/v/477/texture/ground-mossy-rock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c10193ea85579b35e800fcf1cf50bd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D3molitionlover"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
