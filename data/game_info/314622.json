In the multiplayer game can simultaneously participate up to 4 people.<br/><br/><strong>Mechanics</strong><br/>The game has a detailed model of damage to the enemy. For example, hit the legs of a zombie and he will crawl for you, hit into the hand and the monster will lose his hand. This distinguishes the game from other games and shooting becomes quite interesting. The game implements a simple inventory system - you can find and pick up weapons or ammunition and throw it away by sharing your weapon with a friend.<br/><br/>\u0421onsidered gameplay and relatively small spaces of the game will not let you get bored!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T03:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b7025739730767c7c3d2647b6e02477a.jpg", "website": "http://xfairx.h1n.ru", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xFAIRx"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["xFAIRx"], "esrb_rating": null}
