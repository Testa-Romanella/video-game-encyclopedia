So do I, that's the reason my dog Otis and I made this game.  Star Saga One is a fast-paced space style shoot-em-up that takes place at an orbital mine station in the middle of nowhere.  It features 3 different weapon types and a personal shield when things get real hairy. This game has you pitted against hordes of deep space drones, each wave more challenging than the last. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour weapons include your standard Blaster Pistol, the Wolf-PPK, with included rapid fire mode.  The Ram-PPK Polarizer, which temporarily inverts your enemies target.  The last is the Hart-PPK EMP grenade when you're surrounded and you need to take out more than you have time to. Your digital defense is a personal crystalline shield made from liquid diamond, but even it won't protect you if a strategy isn't on your side.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T14:25:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d27/d276484c998778b83cd7b9271d0383ce.jpg", "website": "http://www.GrumpyOtisGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrumpyOtisGames", "Grumpy Otis Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Grumpy Otis Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
