We decided to take a different approach with this game, going for a boss rush type instead. Although short, this game is packed with experimental stuff we wanted to implement in our games. It was a wonderful opportunity to push our pixel art skills and program more complex attack patterns for each boss (Skapare, the final boss, was particularly fun to work on). Desinging the character sprites was definitely a highlight. We took the original concept of fighting squids and expanded on the idea of what a \"squid monster\" could look like: the first boss is a homage to the first Blast, the second is a Magnapinna squid and the third is based on H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:53:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c323ab38b9c9378a2e41148f26f35fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K4lamari"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
