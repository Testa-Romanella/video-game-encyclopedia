But they can fuse, and in fusing, remember more of their past lives, and become stronger against the witch's dark forces.</em></p>\n<p><em>May Samedi smile upon us.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>ABOBO!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to move your spirits.\r\n</p>\n<p>Click on the memory cards on the left to activate available emotions, whenever your spirits are in the appropriate pattern.\r\n</p>\n<p>If a spirit would move into the same spot as another of the same level, they will fuse and level up.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>fae.exe </strong>- Game Designer</li><li>Eliuranel- Game Designer</li><li>Erwan \"Malan'Tai\" Castioni- Developer</li><li>maevb- Game Artist</li><li>Vorpaline- Game Artist</li><li>Akarius Zaler- Sound Designer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:18:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a9c32ad5a3e89157d5c78bd1d46c0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["eliuranel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
