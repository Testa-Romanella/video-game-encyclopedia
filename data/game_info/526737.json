We had many grand plans for the game that we inevitably had to pair back just make the submission deadline!! :-)</p>\n<p>So this isn't the game we intended ...but we had a good time building it and we're quite pleased with how it came together! We've learned a lot from the experience, and have a pile of Indigo engine improvement tickets to work on as a result.</p>\r\n\r\nAssets &amp; Credits\r\n<p>All of the source code and graphics were produced by @hobnob and @davesmith00000.</p>\n<p>The sound effects are sourced from FreeSound:<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/qubodup/sounds/146770/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/320995/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/josepharaoh99/sounds/361636/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/sounds/508833/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/FoolBoyMedia/sounds/320232/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/9377ba0f74d8063ad6cb29cd1e821c22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hobnob"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
