{"id": 308690, "slug": "the-perfect-jury", "name": "The Perfect Jury", "name_original": "The Perfect Jury", "description": "<p><strong>The Perfect Jury</strong> is a visual novel in which you take facts from sources and use them to build narratives. Sources, from print media and scientific journals to social media and leaked documents, are divided into pieces of information, called facts, which can be highlighted, ignored, and reorganized according to your personal beliefs. In The Perfect Jury, narratives don't just convey opinions, they convey truth - as well as lies.</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li> <strong>You control the narrative.</strong> In The Perfect Jury, narrative-building isn't a simple matter of taking sides, it's about identifying the points that matter, bringing nuance and understanding to chaotic, divisive situations.\r\n</li><li> <strong>You control the conversation. </strong>Games which stress the importance of player choice often reduce meaningful decisions down to simple and infrequent multiple-choice questions, while other actions are ultimately more or less irrelevant. By letting you speak at any time by default, The Perfect Jury lets you decide what decisions are or are not important.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Defend your views. </strong>This is a game which doesn't value opinions for their own sake. Good opinions reflect a general understanding of a given subject matter. You, along with the other characters, will challenge each other to demonstrate the quality of your opinions.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Deep sources. </strong>To develop your opinions, you'll work through a variety of multi-faceted source materials, which can analyzed to complete your understanding of the subject, or picked apart to spin a narrative.\r\n</li><li> <strong>Real characters. </strong>Entertainment media which focuses on politics has a tendency to invent characters to personify viewpoints and ideologies. The Perfect Jury isn't just about politics, it's about the people who have those politics.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Please support this game on Kickstarter!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>While never graphic, this game contains some disturbing themes.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is still in development.
