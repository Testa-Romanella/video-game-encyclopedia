They are planning to use primary cubes in their wicked experiments to make an army of Greenies! Blui and Reddi, with the help of their magical connection, must find the engine room and put an end to Dr. BBG's experiments!</p>\r\nDevelopers' note:\r\n<p>While this project will not blow any socks off, it makes me a little proud of myself. Not only was GWJ#21 the first jam I entered, and not only was this the first time I ever used Godot, but this is the first ever game project of mine that I've ever finished! My experience with developing games is messing around with Unity in Jan - Feb of 2020 and the total of ~5 days this took to make, but the dream of developing games has been with me for 15+ years now. Therefore this is a big personal milestone. Now onward to the next project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T03:20:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99f/99fe81355ccb1973c9c8146e840e48e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FennekHeart"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
