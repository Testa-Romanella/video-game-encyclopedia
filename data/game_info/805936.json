Switch lanes to make space for your car, but be careful, other cars might switch back to a different lane! Can you make it to the 1st place\u00a0before your car reaches the finish line? Made\u00a0by ColaniYT and PaulPlay</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: In Firefox, fonts don't seem to load properly and the game sometimes has weird lag spikes. Please use a chromium based browser for the best results! :) Have fun (hopefully)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T19:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f7521781fec06373df832634394d99a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PaulPlay"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
