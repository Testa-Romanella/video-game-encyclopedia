There's:</p>\n<ul><li>A drill, which is the main goal</li><li>Weapons to defend from attackers on the ground</li><li>Shields to defend from air strikes</li><li>Support systems that will very slowly give you more energy.</li></ul>\n<p>If the attackers or air strikes get through, you lose energy.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This project was going really smoothly up until the last day, where I found a major bug in the code that synchronizes the sliders. After fiddling with the section of code for several hours, I decided that I was too tired to be able to fix it. As a result, the enemy damage and spawn curves were left somewhat unpolished and on the easy side. The connection to the theme suffers as a result. If I can manage to shrink the bloated code down and find the bug, I might finish the enemy numbers and release an updated version that's better balanced. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f84/f84434369b43d0832fb09f66abf6088a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["llamaq"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
