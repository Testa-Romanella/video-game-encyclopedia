Each player takes a role aboard a space ship on its way to Mars from Earth. They must work together to solve issues that arise and complete objectives on their journey.</p>\n<p>To win the game the team must keep issues under control during their flight, in order to reach Mars safely. If you can't keep the issues under control (finish a full player rotation with five active issues), your ship will explode - and your mission is a failure!</p>\n<p>In order to play start the GameServer executable and run the game by opening the launcher located in GameClient. This is networked, so four players can play remotely or locally by specifying the host's IP address in the launcher.</p>\n<p><strong>This project was put together by:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Matt Filer\u00a0(UI, networking, systems programmer)</li><li>Jack King\u00a0(card programmer, networking)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T06:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a51fc7c5fead30b4375c2a5ce0a89bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Filer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
