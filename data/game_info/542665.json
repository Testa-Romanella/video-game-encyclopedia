You will have to save your country from this global pandemic, while trying to keep the public and government officials happy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBased on realistic models to calculate the evolution of a virus and the opinions and actions of the public, Quarantine simulates a real-life experience in the political/pandemic games. With the ability to fine tune each and every detail, you can make your policies as specific as you would like.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe all think that we could have handled this pandemic better, but is this really true?
