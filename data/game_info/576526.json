Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br/>Sit back, relax, and solve intriguing puzzles in Mine My Mind, a brand new puzzle game where the only objective is to sweep away at tiles, flag mines, and reveal a hidden image hiding underneath. <br/><br/>Like the classic game about mines and sweeping, the numbers on the tile indicate how many neighboring tiles contain a mine. Use your wit to find these mines and flag them just to be safe, and sweep away at the empty tiles around them to reveal an image hidden in the design! <br/><br/>When the image is revealed, a winner is you! Accidentally hit a mine? That\u2019s okay too! There are no such things as mistakes, just happy little accidents! Keeping going at your own pace or restart if you\u2019d prefer. <br/><br/>Engage in a wide variety of levels, ranging from as small as 7x5 to as large as 30x20. Each puzzle offers a unique challenge for the player to experience. The zen nature of each level is perfect for relaxing after a long day or when you need a break between busier games. Just pick up and play at your own convenience.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Ten 7x5 levels!<br/>- Ten 12x8 levels!<br/>- Fifteen 15x12 levels!<br/>- Five 18x15 levels!<br/>- Ten 30x20 levels!<br/>- And fun and zen gameplay throughout!<br/><br/>Do we have a plot?
