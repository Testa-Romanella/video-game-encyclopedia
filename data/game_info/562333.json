Every day, Honey Command presents you\u00a0with two sets of three events that you MUST attempt.</p>\n<p>Use the sliders on event cards to assign bees to that event. Next to each event you can see the chance of success based on your currently committed bees.</p>\n<p>Mouse over an event card to see information on that event.</p>\n<p>When ready, click on \"DEPLOY BEES!\" to resolve the events</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one life is more important than The Hive.\u00a0You will ALWAYS lose some of the bees that you commit to an event in ADDITION to whatever the outcome of that event may be. Failed events lose more bees than successful ones.</p>\n<p>The Hive consumes 10 honey and 20 bees are born every day. If you end a day without either honey or bees then you will suffer the wrath of The Queen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>At the end of 7 days, The Queen will assess your progress. Perhaps you can impress her with a high prestige score?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming - Russell / Worldshatter<br/>Art - Pippa / IHaveAnInkling<br/></p>\n<p>Made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1</p>\r\nPadanaya Blokov by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4190-padanaya-blokov<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T10:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b3af9983f887f2728298efd5e6fcaa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Worldshatter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
