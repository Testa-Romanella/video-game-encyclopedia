The protagonist of the game is a person who, for unknown reasons, finds himself in the isolation of other people and scans the radio in search of a signal. The appearance of a seemingly incomprehensible message makes you want to find the sender. So you set off on a journey through the unique world of Magnus Failure! Solve puzzles using the right combination of items, find them in the surrounding world and solve mini-logic games. The world is full of mechanisms that open up new locations for the player.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMagnus Failure is an atmospheric journey through the mysterious world of signs, symbols and clues that make up the plot of the game. What surrounds the player is ambiguous. He can freely interpret what happened to the world and why the hero was left alone. The unique graphic aesthetics of the game deepens the overwhelming impression of being in a different reality. The protagonist himself is quite an unusual character because he wears a huge helmet with an attached mask straight from the Japanese kabuki theatre. The game is no shortage of other similar references and symbols that give it its character.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMagnus Failure has ambitions to deepen the player's willingness to ask himself philosophical questions about who he is and what his place in the world is. Will you try to find answers to these questions and plunge into the mysterious world of Magnus Failure? Will you open up to the unknown and find the sender of the signal?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMagnus Failure is an introduction to the world of Magnus. The developers are planning to release more parts!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T03:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd40b46137fb7271566de437c355a9a.jpg", "website": "https://goldeneggsstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sons of welder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Golden Eggs Studio", "Glob Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
