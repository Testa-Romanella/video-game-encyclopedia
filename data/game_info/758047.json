{"id": 758047, "slug": "jetduck", "name": "JETDUCK!", "name_original": "JETDUCK!", "description": "<p>JETDUCK! Is a puzzle game based on old water ring games, where the player plays as a duck tasked to put colored rings back to their respective poles underwater. Like water ring games, the main way to move the duck and the rings are through water thrusters in the environment that blow them away. The duck itself is attached to a rope and could grab rings as well as reel itself back to its spawn point. Should the player want to, they may use a limited built-in booster to detach themselves, but allowing a short burst of movement for the duck. <br/></p>\n<ul><li>X \t-\tActivate blue thrusters\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Z \t-\tActivate red thrusters\r\n</li><li>Mouse 1 \t-\tActivate Duck Boost\r\n</li><li>Mouse 2\t-\tReel in Duck\u00a0</li><li>G\t-\tDuck Grab</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Retorikal - Programmer 1</li><li>Aikacchi - Programmer 2</li><li>Ore - Sound Designer &amp; Game Designer</li><li>Pillowbyte\u00a0- Pixel Artist &amp; Game Designer</li></ul>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a9521a64f2508d767cf2e7106f720d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Retorikal", "Aikacchii", "pillowrd", "OreTheCoconut"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
