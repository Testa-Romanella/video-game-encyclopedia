You may interact with differently-colored objects by walking into them. You can progress through dialogue and descriptions a bit faster by tapping the directional key if you like. Some objects/characters have more than one thing to say, so feel free to interact with them a few times.</p><p>Sojourn is also playable on mobile devices. Swipe to move the character in the same way as described above. Please note that audio is not supported on mobile at this time.</p>\n<p>Sojourn was made by Albertine Watson for the Ghost #bitsyjam\u00a0in the Bitsy game engine. It uses Borksy by Andrew Yolland, including Exit From Dialogue by @mildmojo and Bitsymuse by David Mowatt. All music by the incredible Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo.
