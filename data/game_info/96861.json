Failing that, mankind must be enslaved. Those are the only two options, and if Kyuu has her way, the former will soon become a reality.</p>\n<p>Before she can do so, however, her creator makes a proposition: Kyuu will spend one day among regular, everyday human beings, judging for herself whether they are capable of meaningful change or not.</p>\n<p>Kyuu accepts this proposition, and thus sets out into the world for the first time, coming face to face with a variety of odd individuals as she decides the fate of mankind.</p>\n<p>Will Kyuu's colorful encounters show her the good in human society? Or will the bizarre antics of those who she meets reaffirm her belief that mankind must be destroyed?</p>\n<p>Whatever her decision may be, the impressions Kyuu leaves on those she meets won't soon be forgotten. She is a harsh critic, and for a race as flawed as mankind, her observations and misunderstandings will be boundless. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc54eaba9a92c4c87ab714e9eebb7aec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Zetsubou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
