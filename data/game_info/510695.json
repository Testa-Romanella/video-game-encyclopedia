The player who turn it is should write down on paper, which they consider the lesser of the two evils. They will not reveal this to the other players.</p>\n<p>- The remaining players will then discuss which option they think the first player has chosen and select this from the two cards by clicking on it.</p>\n<p>- The player then reveals what their choice was and clicks on the card they selected.</p>\n<p>- If this group guessed correctly, they move foward 1 space.
