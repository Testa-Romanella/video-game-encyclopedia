Choose\u00a0your collisions carefully, and you shall rise to the top.</p><p>Use WASD to move around and spacebar to boost. You are faster when you have more energy, and to have a visual clue of\u00a0your energy level, look at your breathing speed: faster means more energetic.</p><p>The Guardians of the surface take a lot of\u00a0energy out of you. \u00a0When collisioning with the\u00a0guardians of the surface, they take almost all the energy you have, and you are left moving slowly. If the Guardians corner you, there is nothing to be done other than refreshing the page and start again. If you are stuck in the middle of a pack, you will get out eventually, but it might take some time. I wanted the player to feel the unfair advantage!\u00a0Collisioning with\u00a0small and medium-sized creatures that spawn at the bottom will give you more energy, unless you hit the same one repeatedly, in which case your energy level decreases. Avoid the Guardians,\u00a0go find the moshpit at the bottom, dance with the creatures of the depths, and rise above the surface!</p>\n<p>Works much better in Chrome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:47:11", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eliotbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
