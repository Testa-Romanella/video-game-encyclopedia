Its name is the adventure of the lost way. Later, the game was banned for some reason and the forest was abandoned. Time passed slowly and the forest grew more and more and became a big forest. A few days ago, a plane fell into this forest and the pilot was able to survive. You need to help the pilot to survive and go out of the forest. This is not easy because most of the old traps designed for that game are still available.</p>\n<p><strong>Game team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kavindu Himashana</li><li>Kithmini Rathnayake</li><li>Sheran Maleesha</li><li>Gayaru Hansaka</li></ul>\n<p>CHN Software Developers,\u00a0<br/>https://chnsoftwaredevelopers.com</p>\n<p><strong>== Change log ==</strong></p>\n<p>== v1.1.0 ==</p>\n<ul><li>Christmas update</li><li>New snow falling effects.</li><li>New feature to help the new players.</li><li>Added an update User Interface (UI).</li></ul>\n<p>== v1.0.1 ==</p>\n<ul><li>Game information update.</li></ul>\n<p>== v1.0.0 ==</p>\n<ul><li>Initial release.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T08:50:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71c05a4cfe6d4dcb8244c74a47698b16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Himashana"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
