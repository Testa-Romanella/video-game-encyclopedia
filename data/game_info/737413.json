Only, it took a month or two to fully\u00a0realize in a self-contained, playable state. It's got at most, three blob types, some audio/background variation, and bare bones gameplay. But it's something I made for myself, that may become a longer term project.<br/></p>\n<p>Odds are, I'd give this prototype a rest, while doing another dream prototype here, further assess if it's worth continued development as a spiritual successor to a beloved/iconic flash game there, business wise. Until then, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to move. Left Click to Slash, Right Click to dodge roll.</li><li>Keys; M to Mute Music, N to switch to next track.<ul><li>And click the 'audio' mic at the top/left corner to disable all audio</li></ul></li><li>Probably nothing else to note, bar you can reset high score at the end of the game, if you want to easily delete the only stored data; being your high score!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Slay any blob you come across in the name of spring cleaning, with your trusted \"beatstick\".</li><li>Killing more than one blob in one swing will escalate the total score gained.</li><li>Aim to gain a high a score possible, by killing a lot of blobs in one go...<ul><li>... Whilst avoiding being killed by the mutated, dangerous blobs.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS (&amp; Reference/s)</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Though most of the assets where proto-crafted by me, using a simple image/photo editor.
