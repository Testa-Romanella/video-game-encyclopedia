{"id": 625639, "slug": "fleetjumpers", "name": "Fleetjumpers", "name_original": "Fleetjumpers", "description": "<p>A space simulation game made in 2 weeks by a single developer.\u00a0 I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it =]\u00a0 The web version has simplified shaders for performance reasons, screenshots are from the standalone windows version.</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>Far in the future, mankind has tested the first faster than light jump drive.\u00a0 In doing so, they've attracted a monstrous alien horde that has driven a motley crew out of our birth home of Sol into the vast unknown.\u00a0 Run.\u00a0 Survive.\u00a0 Build a Fleet.\u00a0 Then return to reclaim your home.</p>\n<p>================</p>\n<p>Hopefully the game is self explanatory, but there is a basic intro story / tutorial as well as a manual in-game if you need help.\u00a0 The purpose of this jam was to try and give me more time to focus on practicing my game design.\u00a0 The game is still poorly balanced, very short, and has lots of flaws, (and exploits) but I\u00a0definitely feel like I leveled up and learned a lot.</p>\n<p>My goal was to try and capture the feeling of triumph.\u00a0 Conceptually I was inspired by the movie Alien, where you spend the whole movie running from a big bad scary invincible monster.\u00a0 Then there is the moment where Ripley steps out of the shadows in a power suit and you think \"Hell yeah!\u00a0 Now we get to be the big bad\".\u00a0 I fell short of that in this game, of course, but that was the motivation.</p>\n<p>Gameplay wise I was heavily influenced by X-Com (the original simulation-y one) and was watching a lot of Winters SEO playing Warhammer 40k BatReps in the background while working.</p>\n<p>Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.</p>\n<p>All art, code, etc I made while making this game\u00a0is released under MIT creative commons.
