{"id": 668637, "slug": "campaign-season", "name": "Campaign Season", "name_original": "Campaign Season", "description": "<p>Vote for your friends in this simple party game. As a campaigner, try to convince your other friends as voters to vote for you and your randomly selected prompt, going head-to-head against another one your friends! As a voter, stake your country's future on whoever can speak better from your two friends! This game was made using Unity and the Photon Engine . The beta version of the game was submitted as a school project.\u00a0 NOTE: If your game doesn't work, try restarting it or refreshing if playing on itch.io</p>\n<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>\n<p>Have you or your friend host the game and join the lobby. Once the game has started, two campaigners will be selected amongst all the players, while the rest will become the voters. Campaigners will be given a random prompt they have to implement to a proposal, and will be given\u00a0the time to convince voters that their proposal is not the worst thing to vote for\u00a0(you and your friends will be in a call separate from the game, like discord) and convince the voters\u00a0to vote for them. The game ends when one of the campaigner gets 5 points and wins Campaign Season!</p><p>[ CLARIFICATION: Campaigners are given terrible prompts(i.e. illegalize gay marriage), and they have the time to frame it in a good light or to hide it behind something grander. They MUST include the prompt in their pitch. Players will vote for the lesser of 2 evils, and whichever campaigner gets 5 prompts voted in first wins.]<br/></p><p>Reminder: there is only 1 set of 2 campaigners each game, it does not change per round. If you wish to be a campaigner, host a new game and ask people to join your room. the 2nd person to join will be your opponent.</p><p>THIS GAME ONLY WORKS WITH 3 PLAYERS OR ABOVE. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PLAY WITH 6 PLAYERS OR MORE.</p>\n<strong>CREDITS</strong>\n<p>Rafael Ignacio - Game Idea, Coding, Game Art</p>\n<p>Aidan Abat - Cover Art, Background Art, Beta Testing</p>\n<p>Jude Russel Jawod - Game Idea, Beta Testing<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T07:16:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf7a1b12fb4832db10b6b45372273e07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Rafael Ignacio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
