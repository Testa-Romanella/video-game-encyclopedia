How will basic RPG battle mechanics\u00a0turn out if you can't get hit even once?</p>\n<p>Note: unfinished, sorry. At least you can win and lose the game, and explore the maze. Just escape the random encounters, they give no rewards.</p>\n<p>WARNING: Fatal bug caused by missing assets detected, to fix please create a new folder called \"img/pictures\" and copy all images from \"img/faces\" folder there.<br/></p><p>Also the audio is loud so maybe lower your volume first.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD/Arrows to move.<br/>Q/E to strafe.<br/>Z/Enter to confirm.<br/>X/Esc to cancel.</p>\n<p>Made in RPGMaker MZ.\u00a0Third party plugins and assets:<br/>-VisuStella MZ<br/>-MZ3D<br/>-Torioh\u00a0https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/76306699</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af98c4619bf2eb5962c851e406f19b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teamgehu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
