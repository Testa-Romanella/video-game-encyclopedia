More than 800 letters survived, which are a look straight into Van Gogh's heart and mind, or better yet, <strong>his letters are a gate into his soul</strong>.</p>\n<p>I've read all of his letters and I always felt \"connected\" to him. When I read about the theme \"Unstable\" in a game jam (Ludum Dare), I had a burst of excitement: <strong>\"THE PERFECT THEME TO MAKE A GAME ABOUT VAN GOGH\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>So I chose one of his periods - Arles, France - in which his mood fluctuated on a daily basis, and <strong>in a matter of 3 months went from being extremely excited to have a mental breakdown (ear cut)</strong>. The reasons? This is what you can see in the game.</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul><li>The chronological order of some of the letters was changed, to accommodate the structure of the game, but the content has been unchanged.</li><li>Music from https://www.zapsplat.com/.
