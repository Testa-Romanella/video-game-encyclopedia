(itch) (ChillociRaptor)", "description": "<p><em>Watch Out!\u00a0</em>Is a momentum focused action game set in a 2.5D dystopian environment. As the player, your objective is simple. Retrieve the files hidden throughout the levels. In order to do this you will need tools. A gun. A grapple hook. And the ability to slow down time. But you cannot dilly dally. You have a time limit. As much as you control time, it is against you. Retrieve the files and find an escape route before the voids of time consume you.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:57:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6afd5fad7ca2230cdcfafb668a66c5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChillociRaptor"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
