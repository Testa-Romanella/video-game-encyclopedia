Each location\r\nwill give you the opportunity to talk to the locals, or unlock rare bonuses, with every\r\ninteraction influenced by YOUR knowledge of the Hobo Code.\r\n</p>\n<p>To move to the next state, you need to find the train station location, the train time, and\r\nthe number for the safe carriage...
