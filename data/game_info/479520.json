But here is the twist (given the Jam theme <strong>\"Rewind\"</strong>)\u00a0:</p><p><strong>You can only go back when switching forms, if you switch from the chick to the egg, you won't be able to use the past forms anymore for the duration of the level.</strong></p><p><strong>Abilities:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Chicken:\u00a0</strong>Can jump and push crates around</li><li><strong>Chick</strong>:\u00a0Can glide through the air when holding the <em><strong>Jump button</strong></em></li><li><strong>Egg:</strong>\u00a0Can roll faster when holding the <strong><em>Run button</em></strong></li></ul><p>There are five levels currently, so the game is pretty short at the moment. I'm trying to come up with some new level to add. I used this jam to get back again into Game\u00a0Dev, so the play time of the game did not matter that much to me. It was more important to finish a project for once (looking at you folder of unfinished projects... \u00ac\u00ac)</p><p><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></p><ul><li>Movement: WASD (or arrows)</li><li>Jump:\u00a0W or Up arrow</li><li>Rewind form:\u00a0Space</li><li>Run:\u00a0Left\u00a0Shift</li></ul><p><strong><em>Development:</em></strong></p><p>The game was created in four days (I could not use all the available days due to work time constraints). This is my first jam ever and I'm pretty satisfied with the results although the process was not easy. I had not touch unity since some years ago and I always wanted to come back, so this was a great opportunity.\u00a0</p><p>The programming part was not difficult, but looking at it now, I still have a lot to learn about Rigidbodies, Physics and how it al interacts with movement.</p><p>For the art I just threw myself into Aseprite knowing absolutely nothing. It was hard at the start, and many hours were wasted redoing multiple sprites, but I'm happy with the result knowing that I've never been an 'art' person.</p><p>I added sounds for some of the actions, but I'm a zero in soun design. The music is from the game:</p><ul><li>\u00a0<strong>\"In search of the fallen star\"</strong>- By <strong>Dkiller</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T11:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f12/f12321bb11d481478f1afe2936773229.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fabia Figueras"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
