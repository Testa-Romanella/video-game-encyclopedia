The theme of the jam was \"Money,\" so I made a game that challenges the player's ability to memorize items in a specific order. In the game, you control a coin and use your self to acquire an item.</p>\n<p>During this jam, the participants are also encouraged to use a new web monetization feature from coil. Of course, I implemented it! The idea that I came up with was to unlocked a specific feature as a means of appreciation. Then, for every minute that the game got monetized, I also give the player a token, which is a second currency to buy items in the shop.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/>Remember the items in your inventory, then you (the coin/ player) will have to get them base on a specific order. The more items you need to collect, the higher the coins you earn. However, if you feel despair and hopelessness, consider restarting the level.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>Movement:\u00a0 A/Left Arrow Key or D/Right Arrow Key<br/>Jump: Space Bar<br/>Dash: Press a movement key twice</p>\n<p><strong>TOOLS</strong><br/>Audacity<br/>Bfxr<br/>Gimp<br/>Inkscape Studio<br/>Kdenlive<br/>LMMS<br/>OBS<br/>Unity3D Visual Studio Community<br/>VLC</p>\n<p><strong>BGM BY TEKNOAXE<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Royalty Free Music #245 (The Cotton Candy March) Orchestra/Comedy/Drama</p>\n<p>Royalty Free Background Music #23 (Playful Banter and Tricks) Orchestra/Comedy/Drama<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77abe324508ce23d2a9752dabefecbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Croben Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
