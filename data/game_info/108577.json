You're\u00a0the only one who can <strong><em>smith weapons</em></strong> and help those brave warriors! Some will want <strong><em>Iron</em></strong> weapons but the other ones want <strong><em>Gold</em></strong> and <strong><em>Bronze</em></strong>! You must be <strong><em>very fast</em></strong> because the more weapons you make, more warriors there will be!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you become the worlds greatest blacksmith and help those brave warriors?!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>- WASD - Walking</p>\n<p>- Hold F to pickup things</p>\n<p>- Look at metal and press LMB to hit it with your hammer</p>\n<p>- Hold E to open your smith menu</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- This game is really simple to play and you should pickup it very easily. So the point is to smith as many weapons as you can! First NPC will come and make an order (To see that order just look at him), Then if he wants for example an Iron sword you will pickup an Iron(Hold F) and put that Iron inside a forge. Wait a couple seconds and then put that iron on a anvil and hit it with your hammer a few times until it becomes a sword blade. You will need to cool that sword blade, you can do that easily by putting it in oil/water that's in a barrel. After all this, just place one stick and this blade on a crafting table and you created your very first weapon! Give NPC your weapon and you're ready to go! The last thing you need to know is that you can change what are you going to make.\u00a0So for example if NPC doesn't order a sword and orders a spear you can hold \"E\" and there select a SPEAR.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>That's it! you are ready to become the worlds greatest blacksmith!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Game created in 3 days.</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Engine: Unity5</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/220/2202b343fb9266cd318e44ac7e522b75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LukaXD"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
