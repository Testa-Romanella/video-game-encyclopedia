This one's brutal, fast-paced and competitive.</p>\n<p>What makes CultPong different is the bash move and accompanying camera effects, which turns every exchange into a violent slug-fest, with fine control over ball direction\u00a0due to the shape of the paddle.</p>\n<p>Currently only has local play, with one player on WASD and the other on arrows.</p>\n<p>This is a game that I made last year. I\u00a0never released it because I had this super innovative networking algorithm planned which would completely hide all lag regardless of connection quality.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had some friends over yesterday and we had fun just playing it offline, so I decided to\u00a0 release it so others can have that fun, too. I\u00a0will revisit it some day to turn it into the live service competitive mobile MMO it deserves to be :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-01T03:57:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f9/8f9ecbd8a2965f0ef995a8a8b4ec316a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameCult"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
