You play as a 'statue' and must listen to an unknown Voice, dictating you to find the two mysterious exit points in each level to advance. Unknowingly to the player, the 5 stages take the player through the five stages of grief with the voice of the player character representing them.</p>\n\n<p>It is expected for the player to feel fear and trepidation as they progress through the levels due to the scary music, intimidating scenery, and through the psychological effect of not knowing what is to come. The music is the howling of the wind as it hits the buildings, and the sound of screams coming from some statues.\u00a0The scenery is an abandoned town that is fenced off from the rest of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by the aspiring Game Developer Danice Rodriguez.</p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em></p>\n<ul><li>Danice Rodriguez - designing and producer for the game</li><li>Assets used for the game:\u00a0Flooded Grounds - Free Asset Package from the Unity Asset Store\u00a0link:https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/flooded-grounds-48529</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T03:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cff088e40c0051532014f1c5db1cf0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Danice Rodriguez"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
