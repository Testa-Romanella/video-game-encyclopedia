Created in 48 hours, I set out with a goal to make a game and publish it to Itch;\u00a0no matter how good or bad the end product is. This is to prepare me for some game jam's I plan on entering this year.<br/>Overall I am happy with the outcome. However, I do feel that the game is a little short and for 48 Hours I could of made the levels and danger's within them a little more complex.<br/><br/>As always, thank you for checking the game out and please tell me what you think of the game below!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T09:11:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50f26f821fecbd07b65b332e2c8b4221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tariq Carter"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
