Therefore, if it seems to you that it is time to change something in life, then this is one of the options. You can try in safe mode - in the form of passing our game - and then think again about whether you need this in real life<br/><br/><br/><h3>GAMEPLAY FEATURES</h3>The game alternates between two types of gameplay. One is designed for arcade adventure missions, with elements of simple puzzles and a small amount of battles. The second is intended for fierce battles against entire armies of traitors and their heretical bosses. As a result, we adjusted everything so that the player does not get used to one type of gameplay and constantly faces new challenges.<br/><br/><br/><h3>TUNE THE MUSIC OF THE HIGHER SPHERES</h3>Taking up a sword in order to make the world a better place, you should concentrate on thinking about something good, light and sophisticated.
