The artwork is all hand-drawn pen sketches that I scanned and\u00a0colored in on the computer.</p>\n<p>To move around, just click on the ground wherever you want to go. White icons appear over some objects; when you're standing close enough, you can click the icon to interact with it.</p>\n<p>The game engine is inspired by\u00a0bitsy. My goal was to make an engine with similar capabilities for quickly creating simple games and interactive stories, but using hand-drawn sketches instead of pixel art.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this game might not work in older browsers, and does not seem to work in Safari.
