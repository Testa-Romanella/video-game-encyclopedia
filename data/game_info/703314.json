It is an artistic simulation that attempts to showcase how difficult it is for many people to get motivated. Unbeknownst to most people, there is actually a tiny, microscopic person living inside our brain called the \"Motivational Conductor\". This hard worker maintains and controls the \"Motivation Machine\", the part of the brain responsible for generating the motivation that drives us through daily life. Unfortunately, despite the conductor's best efforts, generating enough motivation can oftentimes be a challenging task. Chemical imbalances within the brain can mess up the machine, making the delivery of motivation much harder. Furthermore, motivational black holes, created by distracting outside stimuli, are an immense nuisance for the conductor. However, the conductor remains undeterred by these obstacles and strives to do the best they can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/367/3672f5b359e8fd536800653abfbc9abf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kwesticles.2199"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
