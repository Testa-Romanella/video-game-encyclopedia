VR seems to be one of the best ways to combine those passions. It feels like something happens when you put on the headset and step into a VR rhythm game. For me it's a place I can dance like no one is watching and I love to really get into the beat or melody of a song. I wanted to create an experience where you could express yourself dancing however you want to a song and then replay it in a way that feels like you're in the middle of an intense VR action game. And so \"Defeat the Beat\" was born.<br/><br/><strong>Overview</strong><br/>Defeat the Beat has 2 main components. Recording and Playing, both done in game in VR. You can search for a song and record your movements to the song. After recording or downloading beat maps you can try for a highscore against the boss as it sends attacks at you in the exact way the song was recorded.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Recording</strong><br/><ul><li> Creating beatmaps are done entirely in VR<br/></li><li> Search for any video on YouTube to record to<br/></li><li> Use 4 different weapons (Shield, Sword, Blaster, and Bow) to create a beatmap to however the song makes you feel<br/></li><li> Currently songs are saved locally and the files do not contain any copyrighted information so they can be shared outside the game legally</li></ul><br/><strong>Playing</strong><br/><ul><li> Face off against the beat - and try to match the moves of the beatmap's creator<br/></li><li> Record your highscore locally<br/></li><li> Weapons automatically switch to whatever is needed at the time so you can focus on hitting the beats.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d63627a3c86c9e57ee21c25540bd3c.jpg", "website": "https://flyingfire.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flying Fire"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flying Fire"], "esrb_rating": null}
