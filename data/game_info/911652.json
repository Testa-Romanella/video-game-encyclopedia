You must navigate the bird through a series of pipes by timing the flaps to keep the bird from crashing. The longer you can keep the bird flying, the higher you're score will be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game ends if the bird crashes into a pipe or leaves the screen.<br/><br/>Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T06:36:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09b/09b0ce7fadc9650109f93eac4d24a938.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonas Wahle"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
