The theme was \"Cabane\" (\"Shack\" in french.)<br/>This game was developped with the Bitsy application by Adam Le Doux.<br/><br/>Video games have a direct link to my perception of the shack. The shack is for me a space calling to childhood and the game where we project our imagination, imagination built with cultural references. We build in the shack a game space, with a different set of rules from those in the social contract.<br/>Bitsy app, which allow to create simple and minimalist video games, is for me an extension of the shack, allowing me to project my own cultural references in a space dictated by game ruleset. Beyond a creative tool, Bitsy is for me a playful tool where I can play with my own referebces and manipulate them as I want.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T07:39:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4b42cb182c6bc5ed37a720b19b1a6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Monplaisir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
