Avoid the saws and collect blue coins to finish a cycle. While any coins remain on screen, you cant finish the cycle.</p><p>Audio:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/frankum/sounds/378665/ changed the pitch and speed of it a bit.</p><p>I think I had a good idea for the jam - its all about cycles and parts of it repeating, part of it changeing - but had too little time to finish the game. There is no juice in the gameplay. Had huge time constraints and was not feeling very motivated. But finished something!</p><p>Sometimes it feels good to do a janky game and still \"release\" it. I hope it helps with my anxiety to show my games to others.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:22:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d18e08ecbae9900225d82fa53de5c77e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Antomaat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
