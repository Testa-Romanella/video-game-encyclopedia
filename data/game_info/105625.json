In Italy it's also referred as \"the tears of Saint Lawrence\". On the day of that saint's martyrdom it's a tradition for people to stay up at night and watch the sky, looking for shooting stars. Because it's said that if you see a shooting star, and make a wish, that wish will be granted.</p><p>So we went uphill, we found a quiet place, we put a blanket on the ground and watched the stars. It was a pleasant summer night. And we were together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62a/62af50a52faca7dc2d75ab82adb3656b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sofia Abatangelo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
