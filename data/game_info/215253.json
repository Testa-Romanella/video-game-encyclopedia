{"id": 215253, "slug": "sky-jogger", "name": "Sky Jogger", "name_original": "Sky Jogger", "description": "<p><strong>Description:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Sky Jogger is a platform, endless runner-like game, in which you have ZERO control over your avatar. Instead, you can control the gravity of the environment in order to avoid the falling meteorites or pick up the power-ups. Made for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2018, it follows the theme <em>genre without core mechanics</em>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The character's position in the game is fixed, so the only thing your can control is... well, basically everything else. Strengthen the gravity will make the falling objects falls faster and preferably before you, while lowering it make them glide, wishfully above you. <br/></p>\n<p>Switch regularly between the two states to create a trajectory which ideally avoids meteorites and desirably (ah, synonyms...) try to pick the hearts which give you additional health. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made with mobile platforms in sight (but released for Windows to make everyone's life easier: mine, yours, the jam raters', mine...), this game can be played with a single finger. Left click to weaken the gravity when it's strong, or to strengthen it when it's low. <br/></p>\n<p>If you've got a second hand (and/or additionnal fingers), you can also use the space bar, or even the A button of your Xbox controller (not included). You're even free to change the controls so it's your call, really.</p>\n<p><strong>Goals:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Sky Jogger is an endless game, so there is no real goal to it. In the end, that guy's always gonna get crushed by some stupid rock. Way to go man, I told you not to go for a jog during a meteor shower ! <br/></p>\n<p>But hey, it's an arcade style game so you can still try to beat the record time. That is, if you can...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Any asset (be it visuals, music, sound effects or whatever) used in this game and not made during this jam is listed in a text file included with the game.
