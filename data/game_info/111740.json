Use the side grip buttons on the Vive controllers to grab onto rocks, trees and other wooden objects. Throw yourself off ledges to get to the next obstacle. <strong>Climb the mountain! Collect the star! </strong><p>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Note! </strong>If you get motion sick from climbing or falling experiences, this might not be for you. Also a caution if you are afraid of heights. \r\n</p><p>The Mountain Climb launches in early access on itch.io at 75% completion. There are still a few bugs involving falling through the terrain, but It can be played from start to finish.  The game is currently about 20 minutes long, depending on skill level.<br/></p><p>*Update 1 - Music added!
