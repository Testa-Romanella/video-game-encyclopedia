That&#39;s a job for the Mad Digger!<br />\nOnce Grandpa Pecos decided to share a secret with his grandson \u2014 there&#39;s a hidden treasure buried somewhere on the former mine. But there&#39;s one problem. The treasure lies very deep underground at a depth of more than 100 yards! Then the grandson thought about his friend, the Mad Digger. He&#39;s the only one to get things done.<br />\nYour task is to dig deeper and deeper until you find the treasure. It&#39;s not as simple as it seems. The oxygen runs out with every descent, you need to extract minerals to improve your equipment and tools as well as to buy grenades and dynamite to make the descent faster.Equipment description:<br />\nPickaxe \u2014 your main tool. Upgrade it to dig faster and more efficiently.<br />\nOxygen Tank \u2014 allows you to stay underground for a long time. Upgrade it to increase the time limit.<br />\nDrill \u2014 a big drill which allows you to pass the first layers much faster and collect more resources.<br />\nGrenade \u2014 has a small radius of action, but all the blocks blown up by a grenade never go waste, and if they contain something useful (resource or oxygen), you will take it.<br />\nDynamite \u2014 has a large radius of action, it is very convenient when you need to quickly cover a considerable distance. Dynamite has a drawback when compared to a grenade: it destroys everything in its path, and if you blew a block with a resource, you won&#39;t get it.<br />\nRadWater \u2014 water with moderate radiation dose. It makes the Digger 10 times stronger and faster while active.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-26T14:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b4/3b42acebfb3af705fc9565a44f2ac5ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 92, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Berezka"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Berezka"], "esrb_rating": null}
