There is a main villain \"Almaz\" and you should try to survive and do whatever ever game asks you to do. If you like weird indie games\u00a0for one-time play, this may be the thing you should try. The game style more feels like \"Grany\". <strong>PLEASE PLAY NORMAL MODE FOR THE FIRST TIME</strong>. It is the most bugless mode.</p>\n<p>INFO FOR MORE INTERESTED USERS:</p>\n<p>Ok so this game is my first game and I created it alone, for your understanding I had skills just to create 2D platformer games, so the fact that I finished(kinda) a 3D game which has ultimate hard mechanics(for me I mean) is an incredible feeling.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration: </strong>The main villain in this game is my friend Almaz. He is a gamer like me and we play character-based online shooters, and in most of the games, his chargers were nerfed so many times by developers. He was talking about it all day and night, so one day I told him that \"Dude, I will literally make a game where you chase a player and annoy him with your complains\". So as you can understand jokes became reality. There are tons of references to other games such as <strong>APEX LEGENDS, VALORANT, and ROCKET LEAGUE. </strong>So if you have played these games you should find it interested to play ThkGasAlmaz. I hope I will not go to jail for using references from other games mentioned before. Just in case: \"ALL COINCIDENCES ARE RANDOM AND EVERYTHING SAID IS SARCASM.\". So guys have fun playing my game, hope you will like it, expect so many bugs and problems, good luck)))</p>\n<p>You can check out the\u00a0<strong>Timelaps\u00a0</strong>video of me making this game, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN TIMELAPAS:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T12:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/084/08456afd7f6141dc580764ae750432f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Forceee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
