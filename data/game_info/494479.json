The calculation and scenario engines include more than 100,000 data, 15,000 texts and 10 hours of recorded dialogue. A detailed and animated 3D world map helps to support the players, with all the borders, regions and important and strategic locations of the world<br/>The game combines management stages of economics, commerce, wargames, construction, espionage, simulation, and political influence and manipulation.<br/>Players can opt for the management of just one country or several simultaneously and design collaborative strategies to change the world's destiny. There are game settings across multiple domains: degree of activity of terrorist organizations, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of populations, outbreak of wars. More than twenty contextual scenarios with current events from today's world are integrated.<h3>2020: A TURBULENT YEAR!</h3>As the year 2020 begins, the Covid-19 is spreading...<br/>As the head of one or several nations, take up the greatest challenge of the human race since the Second World War as you try to contain this health crisis and its economic impact.<br/>This game also offers multiple scenarios: a simulation of the world without the Covid-19 pandemic, a glimpse of a future with the emergence of an even more dangerous virus, participation in the 2020 US presidential election, the transformation of the player\u2019s political system into an absolute monarchy, and various ongoing conflicts which showcase the new wargame functions (formation of squads, missile silos, anti-aircraft batteries...).<h3>A TOTALLY UNIQUE SIMULATION ENGINE</h3>The game engine, Geopolitical Simulator 4, includes over 600 data elements for each of the 175 playable countries and calculates their changes in real time throughout the game based on players\u2019 actions. Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Power &amp; Revolution simulator for education and training.<br/>Over one thousand playable actions. At the country\u2019s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more.<br/>Propose bills to be voted on in Parliament, for example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc.<br/>The player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more.<h3>SIMULATIONS OF MAJOR GLOBAL THREATS</h3>The Geopolitical Simulator 2020 Edition simulates all the major perils that threaten the planet and produces a comprehensive assessment for each one from the results along with specific graphics. The list of threats is substantial and many of them are interconnected: global warming, the widening of social inequality, the risk of global atomic war, overpopulation, unemployment, atmospheric pollution, terrorism, cybercrime, regional conflicts, food insecurity, world hunger, deforestation, natural disasters (storms, floods, drought, extreme heat...), rising sea levels, ocean acidity, disappearance of animal species, climate refugees, epidemics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u2026<h3>PLAY AS THE OPPOSITION</h3>At the head of a legal or illegal organization, the player can take power by force, revolution, diplomacy, or democratic election. To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates\u2026<h3>AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERS</h3>All actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...).<br/>To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game).<h3>REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES</h3>The world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... <br/><br/>As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts. City battles are shown on precise maps with all the major buildings and intersections. The players, according to the side they represent, can direct police, hooligans, military personnel or armed extremists to these locations and construct barricades, send in snipers, loot the banks, or have armoured vehicles move in.<h3>SECRET SERVICES</h3>Secret services play an important role. They have an arsenal of espionage and \\\"special\\\"\" operations: reveal scandals about an opposing political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage foreign infrastructure, assassinate an opponent, send reconnaissance drones or position satellites to locate enemy units, etc.<h3>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS</h3>International organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council\u2019s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization.<h3>INCLUDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS</h3>    \u2022 Game operating as single-player with a multi-country mode allowing play with several countries simultaneously<br/>    \u2022 Game settings: terrorist activities, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of the populations, outbreak of war<br/>    \u2022 Player ranking online and in real time<br/>    \u2022 Incorporation of your own photos, logos, names to make the game even more realistic<br/>    \u2022 Interactive tutorial and game help available at all times during the game (in beginner mode)<br/>    \u2022 Learn about geopolitics by playing the QUIZZ mode, including more than 3000 questions<br/>    \u2022 Enjoy different configurations with double screen or 4K screen offering a customized interface<br/>    \u2022 Avec l'extension Modding Tool, (add-on prochainement en vente sur ce site), vous aurez la possibilit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er et de partager vos propres sc\u00e9narios et contextes g\u00e9opolitiques ou bien de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger ceux des autres utilisateurs<br/>    \u2022 With the Modding Tool extension (add-on soon available for purchase on this site), you'll be able to create and share your own geopolitical scenarios and contexts or even download those of other users<br/>    \u2022 Text and dialog 100% in English<h3>NEW CONTENT FOR 2020</h3><br/><strong>Simulation of the Covid-19 Pandemic...</strong><br/>Based on actual data, the pandemic is recreated and the player can follow its progress with various graphs, stats and maps and is kept up to date directly by their Health Director. Numerous tools and legislation are at your disposal to try and slow the spread of the virus: managing inventory and distribution policies (masks for professionals and the general public, screening tests, treatments, ICU beds), construction of temporary hospitals, an arsenal of lockdown measures (for the population, for schools, businesses, bars and restaurants), limiting gatherings and travel, regulating transportation, closing the borders, use of tracking software, transfer of patients and vaccine research.<br/>All of these measures can be customized by region and their level of contamination, the objective being to stem the pandemic as quickly as possible and to slow its progress to limit the impact on the economy.<br/><strong>...and the Economic Crisis</strong><br/>Depending on the situation, the player can impose, or lift, restrictions on businesses. In response to the decline in business, various measures can be put into place: partial unemployment, aid for the poor or support for struggling economic sectors to minimize unemployment and the decline in growth.<br/>The debt and deficit of a country can be strongly affected by this crisis and if, in the short term, the State can rely on international lenders, especially when a member of the European Union, then the player will have to return to more acceptable levels in the long term so as not to alarm financial markets.<br/><br/><strong>Other Scenarios</strong><br/>In \"The World Without Covid\", the player can lead their country in a \"normal\" context, without the pandemic.<br/>In the \"SARS-CoV-3 Mutation\" scenario, set in 2022, when, after a widespread vaccination of the world population for Covid-19, researchers discover a new patient carrying a virus that seems to resistant to the vaccine. Has the virus mutated?<br/>The pandemic crisis plunges the world into turmoil: in the \"Coronation\" scenario, the player can take advantage of the chaos to install a royalty and become an absolute monarch.<br/><br/><strong>Wargames Scenarios and Functions</strong><br/>A number of units and functions have been added: anti-missile and anti-aircraft batteries which can be deployed to concealed locations to intercept aerial attacks, intercontinental missile silos and anti-aircraft silos that are difficult to destroy and can launch missiles at a very long distance, formation of squads which allows the movement of units as a whole to be able to attack as one or to defend each other, area bombing from cruisers that targets multiple enemy units in a single run, forming groups of satellites or drones to cover a larger area, the addition of anti-missile armaments for carriers and certain cruisers, the addition of a \"Fog of War\" mode, concealing stationary missile launchers and reinforcing the defense of military bases.<br/>A special mini-guide describes the function of all military units in detail.<br/>Numerous lightning war scenarios reflecting the geopolitical context of potential conflicts in which large nations claim foreign territory. The player can choose to play as the aggressor, attempting to annex enemy territory within a certain amount of time; as the defender, fighting back while the international community mobilizes and forces the invaders to retreat (China vs. Taiwan, Russia vs. Georgia, Turkey vs. Libya...)<br/><br/><strong>2020 US Elections</strong><br/>Choose your Republican or Democratic candidate and launch your campaign to become the next president of the United States.<br/><br/><strong>Other new contents</strong><br/>    \u2022 God'n Spy: The option of playing as any additional country mid-game, acquire nuclear missiles, increase the cap on additional revenue<br/>    \u2022 Development of 5G<br/>    \u2022 Construction of nuclear fusion power plants<br/>    \u2022 Addition of the World Health Organization<br/>    \u2022 A new economic organization, the Eurasian Union<br/>    \u2022 Faster satellites<br/>    \u2022 Modding tool: The option of creating mods with 30 playable countries<br/>    \u2022 Greater reflection of political tendencies in alignments between countries, especially when there is a change in political parties<br/>    \u2022 The option to change the national anthem<br/>    \u2022 Automatic response system to submitted requests<br/>    \u2022 Options to disable televised debates in elections and for the game to run in the background<br/> <br/><strong>Data updated to 01/01/2020</strong><br/><br/>    \u2022 Budgetary, economic and social data...<br/>    \u2022 Political and geopolitical data: new governments, creation of new parliaments, diplomatic relations between countries...<br/>    \u2022 Environmental data.<br/>    \u2022 Military data and conflict map, ongoing city battles and the status of forces involved.<br/>    \u2022 Terrorist organizations: members, prospects, resources.<br/>    \u2022 A new country: Eswatini<br/>    \u2022 New algorithm for name creation based on language<br/>    \u2022 New characters with new faces: new heads of state or government (United Kingdom, Denmark, Argentina, Greece...), new ministers and heads of parties (USA, France, Germany...), a new face for the head of the environmental NGO working against global warming.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89b/89b3af6949188e5f3a26972e59249522.jpg", "website": "http://www.power-and-revolution.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 37, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eversim"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Eversim"], "esrb_rating": null}
