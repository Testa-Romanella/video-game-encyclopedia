Ascend will have very freeform gameplay that will allow for emergent gameplay, the player will have to make split second choices depending on their current state, in the air, on a wall or making a jump that will decide your path for the rest of the level.</p>\n<p>More information on the development of Ascend can be found on my website:\u00a0http://highlandscomputing.net/year2gd/oliver/<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Wall run</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the environments wall to reach new ledges and areas to explore. You can wall run on a wall, but if you jump off you will need to land or start another wall run on a different wall to climb on the previous wall.\u00a0 Wall running can be used to gain speed and access to new areas but you could end up being stuck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rappel</strong></p>\n<p>Use the rappel points to gain height and speed to reach high points. Rappel points can save you from dangerous falls or take you to new heights, when you find one be sure you plan out where you want to go before hand otherwise you might meet an untimely accident.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Ledge Climbing<br/></strong>When beneath a ledge this is not too far above you, you can scale the ledge. This is currently a teleport to the surface you are climbing onto.<strong><br/><br/>Controls<br/></strong>WASD - Directional Movement<br/>Space bar - Jump<br/>Left Click - Rappel when looking at a Rappel Point<br/>R - Will restart the level<br/>Escape - Will close the game</p>\n<p>Sensitivity - Currently cannot be changed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T09:20:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd3/bd3ac50ede34334ff12e440a54bcc39a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Oliver Jones"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
