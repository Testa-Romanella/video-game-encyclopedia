Or good at explaining stuff with pictures? Time to put your skills to the test in this fast-paced party game. While one player wears the VR headset and builds something out of blocks using their hands, the other players try to guess what they\u2019re making. Is it a house? A snake? A bowtie? Who knows! This modern twist on the classic Charades formula is jam-packed with different modes, features, and of course words, so that there\u2019s always a new way to play.<br/><br/>Features include:<br/><br/><ul><li> A unique block-based building system - easy to understand, even if you\u2019re new to VR.<br/></li><li> Three different game modes - player vs. player, team vs. team, and co-op.<br/></li><li> Over a thousand built in words and phrases, carefully chosen to work well with the building pieces given.<br/></li><li> Extra features like hidden pieces, and first-person camera, that keep things interesting.<br/></li><li> Guides and tutorials so that even people with no VR experience can play and have fun.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e9b49006ebdfc2e20256d450438818c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Fitzgerald"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brian Fitzgerald"], "esrb_rating": null}
