It didn\u2019t particularly end well for them, and to be honest, things aren\u2019t exactly great for another Jack and Jill either.<br/><br/>In Jack N\u2019 Jill DX, players must assume the role of Jack, overcoming many hazards, in a bid to reach Jill, who awaits him at the end of 140 levels, in typical old-school one-button platformer fashion! But, for the players who feel the guy should be the one who needs saving, we absolutely agree and that\u2019s why Jill is available as a playable character as well! <br/><br/><br/>Features: <br/> * 7 worlds made up of 20 levels each<br/> * 7 in-game mini-games., where you can earn tickets for the in-game store<br/> * In-game store with in-game tickets that are used for unlocking hats and screen colours<br/> * Mirror mode<br/> * 2 Playable characters<br/><br/>Purchasing this content entitles you to both the PS4\u2122 system and \u201cPS Vita\u201d system versions!<br/><br/>Remote Play requires PS Vita system and sufficiently robust Wi-Fi connection.<br/><br/>1 player<br/>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br/>Remote Play<br/><br/>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
