(Released under the name Grumble Labs.)  You can get the general vibe from watching the video.  This generates music based on the moves of tic tac toe.  Each position has a note played by a bell, a game ending determines one of three bass notes, etc.  For either 0 players (two AIs) or 1 player vs AI.</p><p>There are ten play algorithms encoded on a slider for the AI.  The dumbest is just pure random moves, the smartest will guarantee an AI win or a tie.  The most interesting music comes from the random moves, because of the most varied bass notes- which kind of made this experiment pointless, as the play algorithms yielded less interesting music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87c/87cf11f49884cb2bbf3ae5a59af18287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["grandtheftmarmot"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
