Follow a trail of cryptic letters from an enigmatic scientist known only as \u201cAS\u201d into a compelling world of challenging mystery and tactile exploration.<br />\nDevelopment on this fully-enhanced HD version of The Room Two began shortly after the mobile release of The Room Three late in 2015 and has involved creating more detailed environments for each level as well as rebuilding and re-texturing every asset in the game.<br />\nFireproof Games are a small independent team working in Guildford in the UK. We self-published our first game The Room on iPad in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room games have since changed our lives and we hope you enjoy playing them as much as we enjoyed making them.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2013-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-03T18:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8e62ef80774d8ac6396372a121bece.jpg", "website": "http://www.fireproofgames.com/", "rating": 4.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 900, "beaten": 272, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 8, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 230, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 235, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Fireproof Games"], "genres": ["Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Fireproof Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
