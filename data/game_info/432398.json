Perhaps this means you are friends! Why don't you give them a gift back? It's the nice thing to do. Oh. You don't have any? Well that's alright! Just REGIFT something.</p>\n<p>Earn points by taking and giving gifts. Earn enough to beat the level and you win the game! Easy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>All mouse-based. Click people and objects in the scene, and the buttons on the control panel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Click a character to see if they have a gift ready for you - then click the gift above their head to open it. Accept the gift with the \"Accept Button\". Select gifts for giving by clicking on them in the inventory\u00a0(you can see a preview of which gift you have selected on the control panel), then give with the Give Gift button, or Wrap the gift (if you have collected some wrapping paper).</p>\n<p>You can't give someone the same gift they gave you, and wrapped gifts rack up more points when you give them.</p>\n\n\n<p>Created by Patrick Plunkett for the 8-Bits-to-Infinity Easy Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T13:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48d548832f8860e94f23448c7aeba68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
