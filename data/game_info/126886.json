It happens to everyone, right? Well, it's happening to Murphy. The problem is he doesn't know how he got there. Or who might want to put him in such a predicament. Or if those orbs are really blood red or just a mildly unsettling shade of vermilion.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is where you come in. You see, Murphy needs help recalling all the signs and portends that may have led him to where he is now. After all, it's not like he's one of those heroes he may have heard about. No. Just an unpaid intern, and not necessarily the brightest of the bunch, even. It could be that he MAY have done something. Then again, things just have a habit of HAPPENING around Murphy. Regardless, you'll guide him through his village, through creepy back rooms of shady establishments, and through his own faulty memory to find the truth in this Adventure/RPG. Just try not to get him killed too much along the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dc/0dc44d9ad9a464bf37c606870132afbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dusty Tome"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
