This latest entry follows Teesh in a procedurally generated platformer. Now filled with competition missing from Kaz Deliverance; you can race your friends to get the best time. This game had several planned features that we never got around to, turns out procedural generation takes a considerable amount of effort. Look forward to the related asset pack.\u00a0https://celestialscholar.itch.io/brick-tiles</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>We sincerely hope you enjoy this latest entry ^_^.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T14:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd0f25b5015ecbf8b129badc747d484.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CelestialScholar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
