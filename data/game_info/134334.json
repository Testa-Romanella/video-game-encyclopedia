The current state is mainly just a test to show how it may work, if I\u00a0continue this project progression will be shown much easier, added achievement, and possibly much more based on if anyone says anything, or how I\u00a0feel about what I think it needs. The final goal of the game (Not implemented in the Game Jam release) is to steal all the spoons in order to build a spoon sculpture.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/039d5987e495510d20d09b58a27ad8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mason Kent"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
