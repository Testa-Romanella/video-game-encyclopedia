From platform to platform over rocks and bridges all the way to the top!</p>\n<p><strong>STORY</strong><br/>One day on a routine trip you crashed your spaceship on an unexpected obstacle and were thrown out of the cockpit. You flew aaaaall the way down to the bottom and landed on a beach. That's where your journey begins to climb back up and recover your vehicle so you can get back home!</p>\n<p><strong>STATE</strong><br/>This is a personal project I work on it during my spare time so the state of the game is still heavily work-in-progress so many things will change along the way. Nevertheless I would appreciate some feedback and want to hear what you like or dislike so far. I am no game dev but like to try something new with this game.<br/><br/>&gt; The game has currently only one short level<br/>&gt; Don't be afraid to leave a comment below and give any suggestions!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Some placeholder assets are from Kenny on https://opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T14:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd9036d5540b906c868b8a603d69b4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spacebar-studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
