Your goal is to destroy all the blocks to progress. My goal was to make this game challenging by developing blocks with a twist. Some blocks are spiky and need to be hit from behind. Other blocks move, trying to throw you off-guard. Some blocks may be invisible. My personal favorites are the gravity blocks that increase the gravity to the point where your ball just bounces around.</p><p>Can you beat this game?</p><p>Disclaimer: The game is currently in full playable Alpha. It has been play tested and major bugs have been taken care of. I am currently moving into Beta and will appreciate any feedback or bug reports.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba7/ba7a23b3be8cd634ced424ca9c7c82ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Muscle Gaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
