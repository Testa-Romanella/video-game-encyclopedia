Each trash tech works in different ways, from distracting and stalling the home dwellers to digging through walls to get outside more easily. Be careful that the Raccoon is\u00a0not seen or heard, or it will be chased and if caught, animal control will be called putting you on a time limit. Escape with all of the rubbish you can before animal control arrive!\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the assets were made fresh for the game jam by ourselves- with the exception of the music.
