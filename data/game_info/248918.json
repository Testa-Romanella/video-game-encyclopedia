At your disposal is the Stingray Mk IV, a state of the art space ship equipped with side firing lasers. Each turn you take, decide if you want to shoot your lasers or move your ship to out maneuver the enemy pirates. Use ship debris, asteroids, and planets to your advantage since most enemy ships will blindly pursue you without regard for their own safety. A word of caution, watch out for the more advanced enemy ships since they will try to evade other ships while coming after you. The deadliest enemy will even try to shoot you to pieces and does not care who else gets in its crosshairs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:12:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569688b66ac42588ba063bae1c313d8a_q6l5eQi.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mark Busman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Mark Busman"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
