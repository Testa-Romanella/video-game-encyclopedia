The game offers 110 unique puzzles from very easy to very difficult to tease, challenge and delight you!<br/><br/>On each puzzle your task is to join the all the blocks of each color by tilting the puzzle to move the blocks. The blocks are special magnets that only stick to other blocks of the same color. The blocks may be joined in any fashion - many puzzles have more than one solution. When the puzzle is tilted, all blocks that are not prevented from moving by other blocks or by walls slide as far as they can in the direction of the tilt. Adjacent magnetic blocks of the same color stick together, including those on either side of a wall. White, transparent blocks are not magnetic they do not need to be joined. They often get in the way, but are vital in helping solve some puzzles!<br/><br/>All puzzles are available and unlocked from the start - no further purchases are required.
