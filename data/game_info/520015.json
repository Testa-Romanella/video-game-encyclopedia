The end product will have a bit more content such as adding Mecha Customization between each level , boss fights.\u00a0 Game is in very early conceptual stage and I\u00a0made a playable Demo of sorta where I want combat to be. I\u00a0took the liberty to use AI Breadcrumb on Unity Asset Store as a baseline for now so I can quickly hammer out content.\u00a0 Was inspired by Pacific Rim so Giant\u00a0Mecha vs Kaiju monsters risk of rain esk mission based gameplay is where I want the game to end up. Each mission will be life or death struggle and users will collect salvage on the field to improve their Mecha before each mission.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7f/c7fd5096c880c5520029a1f14652bb1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bocomarine"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
