You have access to a big variety of plants that all have differing effects on the different scores that you keep track of. Keep in mind how much the park will attract the attention of those who live nearby, the biodiversity, and the overall carbon intake of the park. Make sure that the plants stay healthy and don\u2019t die because of invasive bug species or diseases. Keep the park beautiful and healthy for as long as you can, and reach the leaderboard, if you can.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:51:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a9ab29a7a36222008885a9b89ec367.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HeavensGates"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
