It's only a prototype and a way for me to learn how to use Unity (first game with Unity).<br/></p>\n<p>This is a 2D top-down shooter where you have to defend yourself against zombies for 10 waves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the interface, you will have informations on which wave you are, how many zombies are still standing, you ammo status on the weapon you're holding and a stamina bar.</p>\n<p>When you will fight, crates will spawn accross the map that will give you access to weapons that you don't own or ammunitions for the weapons you currently have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are 3 different weapons in the game : A pistol, a sub-machine gun and a sniper. Each weapon has a reload time and a \"firing break\" (for the sniper especially).</p>\r\nControls :\r\n<ul><li>Move with\u00a0WASD.</li><li>Fire with left click.</li><li>Aim with right click\u00a0(mandatory with the sniper).</li><li>Change weapon with the\u00a0mouse wheel.</li><li>Run with shift.</li><li>Melee attack with F.</li><li>Main menu with escape</li></ul>\r\nNotes :\r\n<p>I worked alone on this project and even though I tested the game so there are no\u00a0\"breaking bugs\", some bugs might appear with the character and weapons (mainly on the animations). I didn't want to spent more time on this project as I wanted to move on to another one and I didn't have enough time.</p>\n<p>I used a FOV script from Sebastian Lague\u00a0(https://github.com/SebLague).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music and sounds comes from\u00a0SoundEffectFactory and\u00a0Stefan Persson (https://www.imphenzia.com/) with\u00a0the Unity package\u00a0\"Universal Sound FX\". I used A* Pathfinding for the zombies AI.
