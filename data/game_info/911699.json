Click on the wormhole to collect resources, buy upgrades, and make difficult decisions in random events and quests.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Information</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>The events will pop up every 1 - 1.6 minutes, and the order is random.</li><li>The game has reactive music that changes depending on what you do: Default Music (always plays), Click Music (when you collect resources), Achievement Music (when you get an achievement), and Event Music (when you complete an event/quest). The volume of each individual track can be changed in the settings.</li><li>The game auto-saves at regular intervals. The interval can be set in the settings, or auto-save can be disabled altogether. You can also press F5 to save manually, and the game will auto-save when using the quit button to exit the game.</li><li>The game has\u00a0<em>not</em> been balanced, so the progression might be a bit fubar. But I made it in a week, so come on...</li><li>If you get a negative modifier early on that makes you unable to gain resources, don't tell anyone I told you this but the save file is located at: <strong><em>C:\\Users\\[User]\\AppData\\LocalLow\\That's It Sir, You're Leaving\\Wormhole Harvest - Clicker Commander\\sav.json</em></strong>. You can open it in a text editor, but\u00a0I\u00a0<em>REALLY</em> recommend that you don't touch any of the ID stuff in there, only the numbers like CurrentScore, ScoreMultiplier, and\u00a0AutoClickRate.</li><li>In the settings, you don't have to click on\u00a0APPLY to notice the changes, it just won't save the changes until next time you open the application. The settings file can be found at the same location as the save file, but it's called\u00a0<strong><em>settings.json</em></strong> instead.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7115afe1c0717f7eac886e494881d169.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatsItSirYoureLeaving"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
