Of course, Zissi forgot it was soon going to be her grandma's birthday so she didn't get her a present and must now search the island for pearls to make her a pearl necklace as soon as possible before it's too late... after all, it might be her last birthday ever.<br/></p><p>The demo was mostly done to show how the game controls and for you to see how the game runs in your computer. It's a work in progress and the finished game will be slightly different<br/></p><p>You can use an xBox controller or keyboard+mouse to play. I recommend a controller. The game contains plenty of shadows and polygons so your pc should be beefy enough to handle it. </p><p>The game is up on Steam Greenlight here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...  It hasn't gotten too many visitors so I could use some help!</p><p>Get the full game here on Itch.io: https://spram.itch.io/zissis-island/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/374/374f21f84c97ef3c8f0ccdd861309c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spram"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
