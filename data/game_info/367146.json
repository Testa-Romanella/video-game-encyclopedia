Some blocks are special for missions or narrative elements in Story Mode. As you progress, more block types are unlocked.<h3>Story Mode</h3>A massive war led up to a series of nuclear strikes that ultimately resulted in the contamination and flooding of the planet. Biological life is mostly extinct. A few AI based mechanoids managed to survive, staying afloat by engineering and crafting low density materials. They eventually evolved, finding new ways to navigate and generate energy. In time, those mechanoids too, were led to war.<br/><br/><br/>Venture in this world through the eyes of a small AI entity that progressively discovers what governs the delicate relationships between all forms of wild mechanoids. Some creatures strive to survive. Others, to reign. Some are fed by chaos. Can this world be saved? Is there hope for peace and order?<h3>Sandbox</h3>In this mode, all elements of the game are unlocked, to be fiddled at will.
