You recently took on a job at a very strange diner. Your boss told you:\u00a0\"Makeadaburgar.\", and proceeded to show you to a door that left you feeling very uncomfortable as you passed through it.\u00a0 The \"kitchen\"\u00a0(if you could call it that) spilled out into a confusing maze-like structure that was clearly going even further beyond the boundaries of any normal diner. Ingredients suddenly materialized on the floor, somehow seeming cleaner than any you had worked with in the past. But the minute you touched them... they began to rapidly decompose in your grasp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The strange man who works the register seems only to be able to communicate in pictures which seer themselves into your eyes in some sort of large, yellow box. He passes you a pen and napkin, seeming to urge you to... keep TABs on things in your own way. You begin to realize that the only way you're ever going to build a burger for these folk is by keeping careful track of the labyrinthian structure of your new found workplace. Can you burg? Will you brave the burg basement when your ingredients inevitably disappear? And how much can you REALLY keep track of in that head of yours?</p>\n<p>Welcome... to Deeper and Diner.</p>\n<p>Game by:</p>\n<p><strong>Art</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0ArtMadeWithSoul (https://twitter.com/ArtMadeWithSoul)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Konadian - (https://twitter.com/thekonadian1)</li><li>Snail</li><li>Yuzu - (http://its-yuz.us)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>PhazonMatrix (https://twitch.tv/phazonmatrix)</li></ul>\n<p>for Ludum Dare 48 (\"Deeper and Deeper\").
