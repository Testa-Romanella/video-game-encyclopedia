Originally began working on this game about in late December, where I've spent a full day designing the CT, as well as working on visuals and other misc. things. Two months later, I've fired Unity Engine and worked on the game some more. Another two more months went by, and today, on April 17th I decided to finish the project up and upload it on Itch. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>PS: </strong>The game automatically runs in the highest resolution by default with high graphical settings. When in game, press \"T\" to toggle cursor. You could exit to menu, or toggle music by pressing in-game buttons that are on the top left and right.</p>\n<p>If the game will get enough attention, I might work on it some more and make it even more entertaining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you'd like to donate, feel free to Venmo me any amount: @berdyev</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:00:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66f54bdda66cdfdf31baff9dccbaf150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ata Berdyev"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
