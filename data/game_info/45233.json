Find your courage. Search for the path through the doors of the temple. Discover lost secrets, perhaps even your own. Pause and meditate, but do not let the Matata's tricks deceive you. There is danger in their beauty and violence in their artifice. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLet the Musiki be your guides, hear their song in the resonance of the world.<br/>\r\nIf you are confused, do not be frustrated. The world is confusing.<br/>\r\nIf you make mistakes, patiently correct them. There is no shame in learning from missteps.<br/>\r\nIf you feel you can't go on, look around. Perhaps the Musiki are trying to show you something.<br/>\r\nMove like the wind, flow like the water, be as strong as the stone beneath your feet. You will find your way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd8f590aa7123a1c1ec90ddd7101e63.jpg", "website": "http://rangigame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Funsoft", "Digigo Ireland"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digigo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
