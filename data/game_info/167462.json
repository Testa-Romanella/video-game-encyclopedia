There are several improvements and adjustments, the most major of which being the unlockable Boston themed levels.  If you can beat the original game fast enough, you'll be able to embark on a new adventure.  Also, it mostly always knows if you have a controller plugged in or are using a spacebar, so that humongous game-breaking bug has been pseudo eliminated.</p><p>The main mechanic of the new levels was inspired by a judge's feeback that read \"I liked being able to cling to walls and climb up.\"  I wasn't aware that you could do that in my game, so either the judge found a bug feature or was playing another game.  This will likely be the last update to this project.  Any more and I feel quite sure that the joke will be killed (if it hasn't been already).  Enjoy!  Reach out if you have any questions/concerns/comments/dry cleaning bills from getting sick.</p>Old update:<p>I added a speedrun timer and a bunch of wacky environmental elements.</p><p>How fast can you go?</p><p>Hard reset (for hardcore runners) for PS4 controller = X+Square+Circle+Triangle+PS Button.</p>The People Have Spoken:<br/><p>\"This is the craziest game I've ever played\" - Person at NJ Arcade</p><p>\"Make a VR build and send it to the press\" - Other person at NJ Arcade</p><p>\"If I didn't have to leave I'd be here for hours and hours and hours\" - Young person at NJ Arcade, who got overhead count on Spin Dash level to -1000</p><p>\"People would vomit if you put this on Oculus\" - Person 3 at NJ Arcade</p><p>\"If you put this on Oculus I will die\" - Person 4 at NJ Arcade</p><p>\"This would be the funniest game to drink to.
