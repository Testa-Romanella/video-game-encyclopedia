Our goal with this project was to confront this issue head-on, by using the LEAP to allow the user immersive, free movement in a 3D space.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Gameplay:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>It is recommended to have lots of room around you while playing SPACEHIKER. Also, sit or stand the Oculus-recommended distance away from your DK2's tracker.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUse your hands to push yourself off of the spaceship's walls in order to reach the end destination. Rotate yourself by holding a hand to either the left or right side of the leap tracking area. And also, try not to let yourself drift away into space.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRecommended specs:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Oculus Rift DK2 </strong>and <strong>Leap Motion</strong> hand tracker<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWindows 7+ (64x)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDK2 Runtime 0.7\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIdentical to Oculus's recommended system specs for the Consumer Version 1.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTE FROM DEVELOPER:</strong> Due to a very strange and unfortunate glitch, I was unable to apply the LEAP-recommended overlay effect to SPACEHIKER. I spent quite awhile troubleshooting this, but I ran out of time. I'd like to apologize for this, as I am well aware that this is an excellent and necessary feature. <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3e96543a26f7f4d4b7ff415b7d324c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["25HD"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
