It helps you memorise the Hiragana and Katakana characters in test and training sessions. There is also a JLPT based learning mode to test your knowledge with Kanji.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\nTyping Test\r\n<p>This mode will present you with a set of Hiragana or Katakana characters. Type in the syllables for the characters to progress. The accuracy is measured through the session and shown in the main menu.</p>\r\nMemory Game\r\n<p>This mode will present you with a set of Hiragana or Katakana characters, including a list of possible choices. Select the correct answer with the mouse or type in the number of the button from 1 to 5. You can also switch to syllables to Hiragana / Katakana mode.</p>\r\nHelp System\r\n<p>There are two major help systems in Taipingu'82. The overview screens for Hiragana and Katakana contain all character and their syllables. Use those screens to look up unknown characters. The second system is available in every typing and memory session. Press F1 or click on the help button to open a Japanese dictionary website with more information for the current presented word or character.</p>\r\nJLPT Based Training and Testing Session\r\n<p>JLPT training and test sessions are typing based.
