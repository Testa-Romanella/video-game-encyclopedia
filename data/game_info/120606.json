The natural creatures of the world are hostile to you since you carry an ancient artifact of your people. The world is shrouded in darkness and only certain things (bioluminescent) \u00a0shed light. Your artifact, however, gives off considerable light and as such creates the catalyst for the story.</p>\n\n<p>THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR A GAMEJAM, and for this reason is chalk full of bugs. If enough support is shown for the game we would be happy to develop on it further, if not enjoy it for what it is!
