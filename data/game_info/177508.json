When I saw the original game its bold colours were a\u00a0perfect match for the Spectrum, and having it run within a frame makes\u00a0for a fast, fluid, sometimes frustrating, but always frantic\u00a0game. It doesn't have cutting-edge graphics, but it doesn't need\u00a0them either, the gameplay is king here.</p>\n<p>Many thanks also to Andrew Owen - previously famed for naming <strong>splATTR</strong> -\u00a0for producing the front-end music for this game, and overseeing my work\u00a0on the in-game SFX.</p>\n<p>More details on\u00a0the original Xbox 360 game can be found at the Electric\u00a0Wolf website -\u00a0http://www.electricwolf.co.uk\u00a0- which also contains a link to the Xbox\u00a0marketplace where you can download the demo or full version of\u00a0the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RetroGamer</strong>\u00a0- \"<em>A\u00a0glance at the original game's screenshots reveals a simple and stylised\u00a0graphical style that works remarkably well when converted to the\u00a0Spectrum. So, even though it might look more primitive than other\u00a0recent games and there's just a hint of colour clash, the result is\u00a0pleasant and uncluttered... Gem Chaser isn't a game to be attempted by players\u00a0who suffer from high blood pressure</em>\" - 85%</p>\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> - \"<em>The layouts are well\u00a0designed and require a lot of thought to take the correct paths in\u00a0order to move onto the next challenge. There are 70 to work\u00a0through, and is a good enough cross-over to please both platform and\u00a0puzzle game fans</em>\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/505d097c2a30609e5a7fdb58e4b0a38a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
