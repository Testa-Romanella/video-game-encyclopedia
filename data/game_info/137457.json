The spectator would give you a rating on how \"awesome\" your\u00a0playthrough was. But that was too ambitious. So I could just finish this in time. ^^ yep I know there is nor Game Over Screen, nor a Start Screen.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy :3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/626/6266aaa5e8ef636c2bb0d74db412612f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NewPuldrix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
