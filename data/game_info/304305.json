{"id": 304305, "slug": "perfect-crime", "name": "Perfect Crime", "name_original": "Perfect Crime", "description": "<strong>Perfect Crime</strong> is a strategy game that challenge the IQ of players. <br/><br/>Choose the right weapon, strike the target, and clear your mark. <br/>Choose the location and time of murder, and use the impression deviation of the characters to create an alibi. <br/>Think about the impact each weapon has on the victim's body and distract the police and forensic experts. <br/><br/>Your task is to mislead the police, and finally achieve the perfect crime.<br/><br/>There are no violent scenes in the game, and the injury process is only described in words. What we hope to provide is an experimental platform for reasoning thinking, so that players can let imagination fly in the game . Gameplay <br/>The game is divided into crime process and case solving process.<br/><br/>In the course of action, the player has to make a plan, create an alibi, choose the appropriate means of injury, deal with the scene and weapons, in order to cover up their own suspects. Of course, before you implement the plan, you should make a careful planning, grasp the action time of each character.<br/><br/>In the process of solving the case, the police will investigate the suspects one by one according to the suspects. And the police will ask for the alibi, and investigate the permanent location of the suspects. Every investigation will affect your suspicion. For example, if you don't have an alibi, the suspicion will increase. The police will finally arrest the suspect with the highest suspicion. If the player is handled properly during the action, the police will come up with a wrong conclusion. So the real murderer will escape. The Perfect Crime will be achieved.<br/><br/>To subtly increase the suspicion of other suspects, you can throw someone else's key at the scene. Or just carry the dead to someone else's home.<br/><br/>In the game, player will be exposed to a large number of props. Such as keys, cups, daggers and so on. Different props have their own functions. However, these props cannot be used at any will. If you and the murder target in the same room, he will notice your action. Maybe your action will be stopped by him.<br/><br/>Players make some decisions, such as strangling or tying people up, which can increase psychological stress. If the psychological pressure is high, you will be limited from some action. Therefore, the reasonable distribution of psychological pressure will also challenge the player's strategic skills.<br/><br/>In the game, you will come into contact with many people, who have different personalities. Different people will react differently to the same thing. Timid people will immediately call the police when they see a dead body in the room. A bold and curious person may choose to examine the body himself, so that he may leave his mark on the scene.<br/><br/>Players can use character traits to choose scapegoats, but creating innocent people is a sure way to lose points, unless you frame it as a \"sinner.\" Alibi <br/>Alibi, a special term used in the department of criminal police and detective science. It is often used in interrogations of suspects by police and detectives. It refers to the evidence that the suspect is not on the scene when the crime is committed.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, if you have an alibi, the police will greatly reduce your suspicion. It is the key to your success.<br/><br/>The game uses the witness form to judge the alibi. For example, if character A sees you enter the restaurant at 8:00 and leave the restaurant at 9:00, then A can prove that you are in the restaurant from 8:00 to 9:00. If the victim's time of death is 8:30 and the scene is the victim's home, then you have an alibi.<br/><br/>Because the player is playing the role of the killer in the case, so the player's alibi is forged. The game provides a variety of ways to forge alibi, players need to think in the game found. Built-in level editor <br/>If you often read \u201cHolmes\" or \u201cJapanese detective novels\u201d, maybe you want to create your own case.<br/><br/>The game provides a level editor to facilitate core players to make their own case. Our ability is limited. Although there are two screenwriters in our team, the possibility of showing the means to the players is still small. We want to provide as much freedom as possible, so we need the players to join us.<br/><br/>There is already an entrance in the game for players to play their own cases. Later players can upload their cases to Steam Work and release their own MOD.<br/><br/>The power from players has always been very strong!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-03T15:01:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c8206cc1bba60d1a120dad3bbf9d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 11}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Skeleton", "GuGong"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["East2West Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
