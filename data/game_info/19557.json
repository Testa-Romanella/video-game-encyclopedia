The clock is ticking, and the enemy is already attacking the vulnerable city near the center of the board with bomber units. Will you pull off your attack and annihilate the enemy? Or will you be outsmarted by your cunning opponent?<br />\nFrom the studio that created the Harpoon series comes this unique real-time strategy game set on a surreal tile-based board game battlefield. Wage war over three eras of combat: Clash swords and loose arrows in Medieval style, roll tanks and march infantry to victory in the Great War setting, and take to the skies with aerial units in the Contemporary mode. Each battle setting has its own unique set of pre-arranged battle scenarios to test your ability to use each unit\u2019s strengths to your advantage, and to guard against their weaknesses. Put your strategic abilities to the ultimate test!<br />\nEngage your opponent in a game that looks like Chess, but plays like a real-time strategy game with individual unit stats, projectile attacks, and the ability to move multiple pieces simultaneously.<br />\nGain the advantage by adjusting your view of the battlefield between a 3D angle and an overhead tactical perspective. Zoom in and out, and pan the camera around the battlefield to find and engage your enemy.<br />\nPlay against the computer in 35 designed scenarios, or compete against a friend in the local two player versus mode.<br />\nNote: Original network multiplayer modes are included but, due to the age of this title, not supported for this release.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2007-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-03T14:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b89858ce6c9eb04c68bbe477caf40f8.jpg", "website": "http://www.1cpublishing.eu/game/theatre-of-war/overview", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 365, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["1C Company", "Artech Studios", "chien lin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["1C-SoftClub", "1C Company", "Ziggurat", "Ziggurat Interactive", "Chien Lin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
