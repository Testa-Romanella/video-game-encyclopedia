For that you must open all the doors of the game to go and rescue her, but beware of the waves of zombies that will prevent you from going to help your friend.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Weapons :</strong><br/><br/>- As soon as you eliminate zombies, you will earn money which will allow you to have better weapons, but also advantages (such as for example, the fast reload).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Mystery boxes :</strong><br/><br/>- In the game map, you will find mystery boxes which will allow you to have weapons, grenades and mines to help you eliminate the zombies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Zombies hide powers :</strong><br/><br/>- When you go to eliminate zombies, some of them will drop powers (like for example \"Easy elimination\", this power allows to eliminate a lot of zombies in 1 second).<br/><br/><br/><br/>So ?
