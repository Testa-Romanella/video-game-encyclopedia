In this game you play as Sun in a world where beings of darkness, known as Abyssals, have taken over and brought eternal darkness to the world. Humanity has taken refuge deep underground where they live by the glow of mushrooms and their one source of artificial light, a flashlight. One day the flashlight is taken from the village and lost somewhere in the surrounding caves, and Sun is given the task of retrieving it. While he is trying to retrieve the flashlight, the cave ground collapses and Sun falls to his death. However, the Celestials save Sun from his death and activate his inner light powers. Upon discovering his powers, Sun gains a new mission, reaching the surface in order to defeat the Abyssals and free the sun. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T08:41:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/973888472bba289cab18c2f511d4d4cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oren Erlich", "trunkster", "bagelbiter", "TayHay", "amshin98"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
