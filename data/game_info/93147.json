Remember a good diet, take your medicine, and you should be fine!</p>\n\n\n<p>Technically OK/NORMAL imitates the capabilities of the original PlayStation as closely as possible, including, but not limited to, affine texture mapping, vertex snapping and low polygon 3D models. Though, unlike most PS1 games, <strong>OK/NORMAL does run at 60fps</strong>, for an visually accurate, yet more fluid gameplay\u00a0experience.</p>\n<p>The game is a short, linear experience, that runs for anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes depending on your playstyle. I recommend taking your time to look around and listening to the chatter your companion provides!</p>\n<p>The game is highly recommended to be played through in one sitting, but it does save between each level, so if you have to run, you can just pick up where you left off!</p>\n<p><strong>OK/NORMAL is also on steam:\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/862580/OKNORMAL/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When you purchase the game here on itch.io, you will also receive a free Steam key.</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\nReviews:\r\n<p><em>\u201cIt wants your blood, your pound of flesh, and it craves the smell of fear \u2013 once you give yourself to OK/NORMAL, allow yourself to be hurt by it, to be afraid, to lose yourself in its sense of depression, you will truly understand, and the experience becomes a vital one.\u201d</em><br/></p>\n<p>The Deadbeat Critics</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>OK/NORMAL</em>\u00a0is a cruel game with a disdain for the player that is both admirable and genuinely difficult to endure.\"</p>\n<p>Kotaku<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<br/><strong>Xbox Controller</strong><strong>Keyboard</strong><strong>Move/Navigate menus</strong>D-pad or Left &amp; Right StickWASD/Arrows<strong>Jump</strong>A or RBSpace<strong>Speed Up</strong>LBLeft Shift<strong>First-Person View</strong>YG<strong>Pause</strong>StartEsc<strong>Confirm menu selection</strong>ASpace or Enter\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\n<p><strong>This game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.</strong></p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Contact:\u00a0</p>\n<p>toni@98demake.com</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/98demake</p>\n<p>http://98demake.com</p>\n<p>Media kit<br/></p>\n<p>O\u0358\u0361\u034f\u0354\u0359\u031d\u0331\u0359\u031d\u032d\u034d\u031d\u0325\u0349\u0323k\u0315\u0321\u0329\u033c\u0347\u033b\u0339\u0323\u032f\u034d\u031e\u0345\u0325\u0345\u0317\u0330\u0333\u0326\u033ca\u0334\u0334\u0361\u031d\u0326\u031f\u0330\u0331\u031c\u0316\u0325\u032f\u0325\u0324y\u035c\u0337\u0341\u0337\u033a\u0329\u032c\u0353\u0359\u0349\u035a\u033a\u0356\u0353\u034e\u032d\u0349<br/>\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/65757941c2489675ffab63f8d7d7d7e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["98DEMAKE"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
