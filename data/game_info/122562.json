Collect power ups to level up your weapon, descend deeper in to the dungeon, then find and destroy the source of this unholy power.</p><p>The Darkness was originally created as part of Ludum Dare 34, where the theme was \"Grow.\" We had 72 hours to create a game, and ended up with the bit of software you'll find on the Ludum Dare page for it here. It was great fun and we learned a lot about how much we've grown as developers this year. </p><p>Here you'll find a new version of the game. This version has lots of changes, including bug fixes, a total rebalance of the game, and new features. </p><p>Windows Xbox Controller is supported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27d/27d31e3eec7744c2a97a379f0e024933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 298, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unibear Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
