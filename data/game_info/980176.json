{"id": 980176, "slug": "steel-symphony", "name": "Steel Symphony", "name_original": "Steel Symphony", "description": "Inspired by JaGeX's Steel Sentinels, Steel Symphony is a 2D Action-Strategy platformer where players choose from an assortment of components to build their robot, or sentinel. The key to formidable customization is creatively balancing &amp; optimizing statistics such as integrity, shielding, mass, weapon capabilities, modular arrange, and equipment carried. Chassis configuration, weapon loadout, and module selection constitute the essence of a sentinel: Chassis are selected archetypally dependent on class such as runner, jumper, flier, tank, colossus, etc... that are further configured to fill multiple roles. Weapons are chosen based on damage, range, rate of fire, energy dependency, area of effect, synergy with other weapons, and additional effects. Modules are delegated to give the sentinel protection, maneuverability, extra power, and/or more complex effects.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T06:44:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3982e8cc72e73182f146a29838ccca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Steel Symphony Development Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steel Symphony Development Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
