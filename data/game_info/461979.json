The students\u00a0were tasked with setting up and managing a workflow and production pipeline within their team, and students\u00a0were asked to volunteer for preferred development roles before the project started.\u00a0Two separate project were created\u00a0by five teams consisting of both bachelor and master students, both of which were based on the book Invisible Cities\u00a0by Italo Calvino, where students had to select a description of one of the cities to base their 3D project on.The projects were created in Unity, and the usage of online assets were permitted.\r\n\r\nSophoria, from Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino<br/><br/>The city of Sophronia is made up of two half-cities. In one there is the great roller coaster with its steep humps, the carousel with its chain spokes, the Ferris wheel of spinning cages, the death-ride with crouching motorcyclists, the big top with the clump of trapezes hanging in the middle. The other half-city is of stone and marble and cement, with the bank, the factories, the palaces, the slaughterhouse, the school, and all the rest. One of the half-cities is permanent, the other is temporary, and when the period of its sojourn is over, they uproot it, dismantle it, and take it off, transplanting it to the vacant lots of another half-city.<br/>And so every year the day comes when the workmen remove the marble pediments, lower the stone walls, the cement pylons, take down the Ministry, the monument, the docks, the petroleum refinery, the hospital, load them on trailers, to follow from stand to stand their annual itinerary. Here remains the half-Sophronia of the shooting-galleries and the carousels, the shout suspended from the cart of the headlong roller coaster, and it begins to count the months, the days it must wait before the caravan returns and a complete life can begin again.\r\nProject 2 - Week 3 &amp; 4\r\nGroup 2 members\r\n<p>Jakob Bang - Art Director, Tech Artist and Sound Design</p>\n<p>Kaspar Dahl - Texture Artist, 3d Artist and Tech Artist</p>\n<p>Sophie Pi - Concept Artist and 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Michelle Mortensen - Character Design, Graphic Design and 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Nicolai Brunn - 3d Artist</p>\n<p>Tomasz Wieloch - 3d Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c95ec1aaf10a3774504719723d30797.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KADKGAME"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
