The theme was \"Combine 2 incompatible genres\". It's the first game I've ever made and everything is made from scratch ,if you couldn't tell :)<br/></p>\n<p>Rise of Robos is a \"Platformer Colony Sim\" where the player must gather enough materials for their colony to grow. The game is won when the colony population reaches 20.</p>\n<p><strong>Some important notes:</strong></p>\n<p>- New Robots will spawn when the required resources are available.</p>\n<p>- Existing robots will periodically consume resources. If those resources are not available they will die.</p>\n<p>- As the game progresses, more expensive robots will spawn. At first robots will require only metal. Later they will require metal and wood. The most expensive robots will require metal, wood, and meat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"A\" and \"D\" to move left and right</p>\n<p>\u00a0- \"Space\" to jump.
