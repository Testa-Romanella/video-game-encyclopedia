The rest of the controls are self explanatory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game mechanic I wanted to experiment with was: if you move your range of vision decreases, if you stop it grows. This makes the game tactical, and adds an extra twist to the game.</p>\n<p>Many thanks, hope find the game enjoyable! Have Fun!</p><p>Backing track:</p><p>yellow by cyba (c) copyright 2019 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial\u00a0 (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/cyba/60166\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fa2fdfa718aadfbe504d8178e3b4c68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Worrell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
