If you just want a quick thing to play give it a try. The game contains 12 full length levels and 2 hidden levels. No spoilers here!

Try your best to beat your past attempts and become the true Nexus Shade.</p>\n<p>Feedback is very welcome this is one of my first games I'm releasing on here. So I would love advice on what I can improve on!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f39cac28c8267eebdf49d90500cb6b26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BionicDoor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
