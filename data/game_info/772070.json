In the Demo version of the game, the map is pre-loaded to showcase the core gameplay elements of the game, but in the full version, the map will be procedurally generated, and multiple levels will be included for the player to clear, and task the player with navigating the ever-changing labyrinths. The player\u2019s aim is to power up and clear the castles by becoming progressively stronger with each run through the castle, emphasising exploration and upgrading.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T10:02:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7c/f7c024861901dbf91811828dbb2eaf78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jamar10"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
