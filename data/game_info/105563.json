An intensely violent bloodsport, contestants must shoot their way through room after room of men and machines as efficiently as possible to rack up millions of dollars in prize money. At the end they face the challenge of one of the Network's final bosses, where it is ultimately decided whether they get rich... or die.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the arcade classic <em>Smash TV</em>, <em>Get Rich Or Die 2</em> is a fast-paced, high-energy arcade shooter, offering players a wide range of weapons to dish out carnage and mayhem against hordes of enemies.
