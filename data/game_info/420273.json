I created this program for people that are suffering being at home because of the Covid-19.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm myself at home stuck at this moment, and I thought I could escape to a beautiful place to enjoy the sea, the wind, and some rest.<br/></p>\n<p>This a free program, very simple, no surprises there. You can walk wherever you want. Som elements have been added if you enjoy to explore a little. But the main reason is to rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let the wind and night capture you and forget all the pain of being stuck at home. And if you enjoy, you can give me a donation to develop new programs. But that is your choice. Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T03:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc8/dc8c0c10b42152ea21f4c221a1217b86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Titan Deep Space Company"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
