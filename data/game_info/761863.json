Now you're tackling the biggest challenge of your life: attempting to catch the legendary River Queen.</p>\n<p>Spend your days catching fish. Cast to different distances and use different lures to catch different fish. Eat your catches to give yourself more energy to spend. When you run out of energy, the day is over. <br/></p>\n<p>At the end of each day, you can visit a shop where you can trade all the catches you kept for better fishing gear. Your fish can't be kept overnight, so you lose any remaining fish once you leave the shop.<br/></p>\n<p>How many days will it take you to find and catch The River Queen?<br/></p>\n<p>Play with the directional keys and Z. Made with the PICO-8. It's a small personal project that ended up blowing up a lot bigger than I thought it would. It almost hits the PICO-8 token limit. Will likely not receive any feature updates, but may have music added at a later date. I will also fix any reported bugs to the best of my abilities.</p>\n<p>There are two available control schemes for the fishing minigame. In the \"standard\" scheme, press Z to make the white marker move left, and release it to make it move right. In the \"arrows\" scheme, you can move the marker left or right with the left or right arrows. The goal is to keep the white marker inside the green area.</p>\n<p>The game isn't particularly long. It saves your progress at the start of each day, but I don't know how compatible the saved games will be in different browsers. If you're having trouble with saves not working in the browser version, I recommend downloading the standalone version.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, please let me know in the comments!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4acb3e231c53b40719652c16457daa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rabbitinafoxden"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
