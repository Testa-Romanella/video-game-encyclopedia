{"id": 460516, "slug": "the-ooze-1995", "name": "The Ooze (1995)", "name_original": "The Ooze (1995)", "description": "<p>Players control Dr. Caine as a puddle of ooze with a head, who can move around and use two attacks. One is stretching out a maneuverable sliver of ooze whose length is only limited by how much ooze he currently has to attack. Players can also spit gobs of ooze, which reduces the size of the ooze. Enemy attacks deplete the size of the ooze puddle as well, and the Ooze will die either if he becomes very small or if his head is attacked directly. He can also die by dropping off the edges of certain areas, or staying on a drain for too long. Numerous puzzles must be completed in order to progress from one level to another. An optional goal of the game is finding and collecting all 50 helices, in order to see the game&#39;s good ending.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-07T07:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/196/1968ea682066c9d2fdfb04209bb9f91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
