The ABANDONED BUILDING EXPLORATION SIMULATOR was created so that you could immerse yourself in the atmosphere of a typical post-Soviet courtyard, which has long been abandoned by all the locals. You will not find here fun quests, spectacular action or other attributes inherent in modern games. Here, as in life, there are no goals other than those that you set for yourself. In terms of gameplay, this is a classic walking simulator. Choose one of the three available levels and go explore an old abandoned yard or an endless green forest.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T03:47:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/118/118fffab8dc119e517c82550d8c6407b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 486, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Performance Artist"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Performance Artist"], "esrb_rating": null}
