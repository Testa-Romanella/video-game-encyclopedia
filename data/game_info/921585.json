These aliens travel planet by planet and extract core energies from the planets along the way. To extract the energy, a specialized machine is dug into the planet surface, which then grows roots towards the core and extracts the energy in a matter of seconds. However, there are some who are not happy with this: The Innocent Locals! These locals will attack our machine with all their might to prevent us from depleting their planet from its resources. Our purpose is to reach to the core with our roots and extract all the energy before they can destroy our machine. To survive long enough, we must shoot the locals with lightning bolts from our machine. As we kill the locals, we can get upgrade points. These points can be used to get more powerful lightning bolts or get faster growing roots. The trick is to strike the perfect balance between these!</p>\n<p>Dev Team:</p><p>Bora \u00c7\u00fcn</p><p>O\u011fuzhan Deliba\u015f</p><p>Art Team:</p><p>Berkay Do\u011fan\u00e7ay</p><p>Serkan Ceylan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T23:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/686/686f2ddd53641e564e56576cedcc31d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oguzhandelibas"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
