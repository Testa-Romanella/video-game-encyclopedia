It can sustain itself by producing electricity and artillery ammunition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Get inside this impressive machinery! Your goal is to cripple the main weapon of this machine - its artillery at the top.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You have to reach the factory that produces shells used in that weapon and find a way to stop the production.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now, you have the element of surprise. The first floor should be no problem for you, but once enemies recognise you are on board, things will get nasty. Good luck!</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Level Design:\u00a0</strong>Maska322<br/><strong>Textures:</strong>\u00a0Maska322, Croteam, Textures.com,\u00a0Xavier (Warped mod)<br/>\n<strong>Models:\u00a0</strong>Croteam\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Sounds:</strong>\u00a0Croteam\u00a0\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Music:\u00a0</strong>Croteam, Borderlands 2</p>\n\n<p><strong>Licences</strong> :\u00a0All custom content made by Maska322 besides what is specified in the readme.

It's the second day of our show and... is it hot in here or it's just me? That's right, this time we're on Planet Kleer! And I've heard rumours that Earthlings are particularly sensitive to heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it is no ordinary Earthling. If you've missed the last episode, we've got none other than self-proclaimed \"savior of the humanity\" - Sam \"Serious\" Stone!
