All test subjects, willing and otherwise, were evacuated to safety... except two.<br/>You and Kayden.</em></p>\n\n<p>Navigate the facility with Kayden utilizing strange abilities that only seem to work when the two of you are close by. Charge electrical fuses, push heavy objects and more in a simple, short puzzle game about what friendship can mean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Made in seven days for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1, according to the theme \"Stronger Together\".</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrows/WASD to move<br/>E/Space/Z to interact<br/>Q for special interaction (comes in later levels)<br/>Left-mouse to move Kayden - and to have her interact<br/>Right-mouse to cancel her movement, then/or hold R-mouse for her to go back through last door she entered<br/>Shift to open a menu where you can restart the level<br/></p>\n\n<p>Not as much polish as I'd like is there, but that's jamming for ya'.<br/>I'm more of a programmer than a level designer - saying this has the same energy as a math teacher reminding you they're \"not an artist\" - so \u00a0the focus is more on the experience than the challenge. I hope you enjoy your time with it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693bc8ff85c8b26715c005640155f74d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sheen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
