The three kingdoms are at war, and all know that only one of them will emerge victorious.</em></p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong><br/>You play as the blue kingdom. Your goal is to conquer the entire visible territory.</p>\n<p>In Conqueror, you don't control your army directly. Instead, every turn you'll have to issue new orders to make your army do what you want to. But be careful what you choose, because the enemies will change their tactics as well at the same time.</p>\n<p>In between turns, the armies will expand their territory and attack each other, according to the given orders.</p>\n<p>The number of units on a tile determines how strongly coloured the tile is, and each tile can only hold a limited number of units. But each unit type has different strength values, so depending on your recruitment orders there can still be differences between two evenly-coloured tiles. Check the 'attack' and 'defense' stats on the right side of the screen to see the actual strength of your opponents (across all their tiles).</p>\n<p><strong>Jam review<br/></strong>A review of the jam entry by community member Tann.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>State of the game</strong><br/>Unfortunately due to the limited time of the game jam, I didn't get around to implementing all of the orders, and the movement / attacking is a bit more barebones than I would've liked. But the basic concept is there.</p>\n<p>The game is currently also fully randomised, so some games will be massively unbalanced.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11b1d8baf0ac6b17fc2c83a93396810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wouter Buckens"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
