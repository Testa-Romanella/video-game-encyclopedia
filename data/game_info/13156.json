GoNNER is also a story about friendship between Ikk, Death, and a space whale named Sally.</p>\n<p>You will die. A lot. This is by design, but it&#39;s not made to feel unfair. You&#39;ll eventually get the hang of GoNNER, so don&#39;t lose your head. But even if you do it&#39;s okay cause we have a lot of replacement heads you can use.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>DAILY CHALLENGES!</strong> Only playable once a day. Levels are randomly generated but in this mode everybody plays the same world and use an identical loadout. Everything resets at midnight (Swedish time, UTC+1). Can you crush your leaderboard foes?</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED!</strong> Every time you play the game the levels will be different and present unique challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>UNLOCKS!</strong> You&#39;ll be able to choose from a variety of passive and active abilities at the beginning of each run so be sure to experiment with all of them and find the play style that best suits you<br />\n\u2022 <strong>SECRETS!</strong> Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas will get you different items that you can then always use from the beginning of each run. We&#39;re not going to tell you how you get to these areas or what the criteria is for even finding them because secrets, duh.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>LEADERBOARDS!</strong> Kill creatures, get combos, score points, and brag to your friends how much better you are than them.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>MUSIC!</strong> It&#39;s really freaking good.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2016-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-10T20:39:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1b5/1b56b734347bf779568e18475f25f389.jpg", "website": "http://gonnergame.com", "rating": 2.92, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 176, "owned": 1114, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 59, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 64, "ratings_count": 86, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 87, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Art in Heart"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Raw Fury"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
