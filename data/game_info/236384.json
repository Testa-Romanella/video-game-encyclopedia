The player controls the base of a tractor beam that picks up objects as you hover over them. The tractor beam becomes larger and more\u00a0powerful as the player abducts everything on the map. Start with little alien people and benches and eventually grow strong enough to take the city in it's entirety.\u00a0<br/><br/>Go for the high score!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75e66387bb8bada6393e8175665f870f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ETComeBack", "johnleeroy", "quira.christine", "Juan C.
