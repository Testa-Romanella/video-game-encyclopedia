It took us about 80h of cumulative work.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>New</strong>:\u00a0An \"easy mode\" was added.

First, in the explosive growth of the bean stalk which is the main antagonist of the game. Second, as the main character is able to master the beanstalk and progress ever further, they are able to rescue the other people of the town which results in the town growing as they move in and add their own charm.</p>\n\n<p>Follow us on Twitter! @FuchsiaGames</p>\n<p>Join us on Discord!\u00a0https://discord.gg/5FKXNxKyE9</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:27:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44dc60ec7dfa1d7e1a5e4fe7e8b6d4da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Fuchsia Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
