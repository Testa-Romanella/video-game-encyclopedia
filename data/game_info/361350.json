But what happens when you have only ONE CHARACTER option and only ONE ATTACK? Now THIS is a fight where it comes down to skill! (or not)</p>\n<p>Controls: First of all, this game MUST be played with two controllers. Use the left joystick to move your character. If you use an Xbox 360/One controller, attack with A. If you're using a PS4, attack with Square. To close the game, press the escape (esc) key, the start button on an Xbox 360/One controller or R2 on a PS4 controller.</p>\n<p>This game is being developed for the GMTK Game Jam 2019, where the theme was\u00a0\"Only one\".
