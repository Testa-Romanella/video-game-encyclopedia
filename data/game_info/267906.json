The owner left them there many years ago, and, as so\r\noften happens, never came back for them. In this particular shed\r\nthere\u2019s a hole in the roof which lets in a small amount of light\r\nand rain. This combination of light, water and freedom from\r\ndisturbance has resulted in something wonderful. New life has\r\nevolved, but nothing like the spiders and wood lice of other sheds.\r\nThese new creatures are much smarter, spending their days inventing\r\ngames to play. The most popular game on the shelf world this season\r\nis called Ploo after the sounds made by the contestants while playing\r\nit. </p>\n<p>Ploo is a game for\r\ntwo players. The playing surface is rectangular, much like a tennis\r\ncourt, but made of algae. This is called the Matt. The Matt is\r\ndivided in half by a shallow trench called the Voc. Certain creatures\r\ncalled Voc Squabblers inhabit the Voc, their spines creating a living\r\nbarrier. Like tennis, the two teams or individuals each take a side\r\nof the Matt. Behind the Matt, next to the Voc, stands a tall plant\r\ncalled a Primer. When stimulated by the Smoo Wobbler, the Primer\r\nreleases a seed or Smoo, which moves randomly towards one side of the\r\nMatt or the other. The team on that side must catch the Smoo in their\r\nmouths, and blow, or ploo, the Smoo across the Voc before it touches\r\nthe Matt. The Smoo can hit a player, the Voc Squabblers, or the side\r\nof the play area as often as required, but once it touches the Matt\r\nit will split open. When this happens, points will be awarded to the\r\nplayer on the opposite side to where the Smoo landed. Once the Smoo\r\nis out of play, another is launched and the game continues. </p>\n<p>The Emulio, as they\r\ncall themselves, use Base Seven instead of the decimal system. So\r\neach time a Smoo touches the Matt, seven points are awarded, and the\r\ngame ends when one of the players reaches forty nine points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4960eadc1766ffa3720346d4fae8c0c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Steve Dean"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
