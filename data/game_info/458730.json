He needs to find Stacy as fast as possible before she gets so mad she\u2019ll leave him.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Search the forest for Stacy and destroy the obstacles in your path. To destroy obstacles Norris can throw items at them he finds in the forest. Once Stacy has been found, the player needs to make her love Norris again by giving her presents within the set time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t find Stacy within the set time, she will leave your ass. If you don\u2019t give her enough presents, she will leave your ass too.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Playtesters needed!\u00a0<br/></strong>If you've played our current build we would love to ask you some questions and hear your feedback!
