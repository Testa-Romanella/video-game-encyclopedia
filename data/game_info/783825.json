Drive around in a buggy through challenging levels that involves blades, hammers, moving platforms and much more.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Avoid hitting obstacles</h3></strong><br/><br/>There are blades, hammers, shooting devices, hydraulic press, spinning wooden planks that you should stay away. Wooden planks will throw you away but everything else will kill you.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Keep track of time</h3></strong><br/><br/>Don't forget the goal. Drive as fast as you can, if you want to. Or else enjoy the journey. But if you want to challenge yourself, then try to finish faster than your current best time.<br/><br/><strong><h3>Don't fall off</h3></strong><br/><br/>Don't be in such a rush that you fall off the platform and sent back to the last checkpoint.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc1/cc169096f274c1512de14749740d95f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Real Gamer"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Real Gamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
