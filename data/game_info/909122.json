She was excited and already got her hands on some seeds, but then learned that these seeds would take a LOOOOOONG time to grow. Devastated by the dullness of her future project she had no choice but to ask the *DARK LORD* for help. The *DARK LORD* was eager to help, but of course had a condition:</p>\n<p>&gt; \"I will help you\", he said. \"But should you ever run out of seeds to grow, your soul will be mine!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>The little witch agreed and so the *DARK LORD* gave her a magical clock with the power to speed up time and change the weather to whichever season she needed. The little witch immediately began her new herbaceous endeavor, but soon noticed that the *DARK LORD*'s offer might not have been as friendly as she first thought...</p>\n<p>Help the little witch grow her plants. Try to raise as many plants as you can at the same time, but be careful, as they all need different seasons. When a plant is all grown up and ready to harvest it will yield more seeds. You will lose, if the stack ever runs out of cards to draw.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/7561822ff3911ce04749b0079153a4bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LordBlackheart"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
