You are a young mage who will prove your worth, for this you will defeat the monsters of the valley.\u00a0But is it possible?</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong>\u00a0Made using just java\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\u00a0X: attack Arrows: move\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s my first game jam and at the moment I only know how to create games in java and generating the executable file at the end. It\u2019s not the best method as WINDOWS might complain and it might not work on LINUX or MAC.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>\u00a0Download the executable file, it contains the game. No installation required, you just click on the game. ATTENTION, maybe windows will block the execution, but press on \u201cmore information\u201d on the blue screen that appears and click on run anyway.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>I RECOMMEND DOWNLOAD THE JAR FILE</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c82/c826b4628036b6a9dff80009e53695c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThulyoAraujo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
