The bedbugs of Bedford start out every morning by climbing up The Great Mattress, with the goal of extracting blood from the \u201cLord Above\u201d. Every day is the same in Bedford, and Benny Bug starts to question this cycle, calling out the colony Elders, saying it's stupid. For saying this, Benny is banished from the city, and forced to wander the rest of the house. Here, he meets other banished bedbugs, who quickly become his companions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The game was made for the Spinoff jam by my girlfriend and I, using the Spinoff app supplied by the hosts. My girlfriend did all of the art, like characters and backgrounds, while I put everything together in the Spinoff app, and handled writing. We had several ideas before going with this one, including an educational story on Autism, as my girlfriend has it. She wanted to draw \"cute, anime, bedbug girls\" though, and who can blame her?</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T09:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40e/40e52dc0fd5a15b58fc5e02afa9b1ecc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TorDEV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
