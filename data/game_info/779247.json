Your kind\u00a0donations allow me to occasionally take my\u00a0wife out for lunch in lieu of the hundreds of hours a year spent on C64 development, and are greatly appreciated!\r\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>I was inspired to attempt to\u00a0create a really accurate port of Pacman after reading The Pacman Dossier by Jamey Pittman. There have been some good ports and clones on the C64, and of course there is the definitive Ms Pacman conversion in the shape of Lady Pac, but the level of detail in the dossier gave me everything I needed to get as close as possible to the original arcade game.\u00a0<br/><br/>In order to achieve my ultimate aim that a player who can play a perfect game on the arcade can also do so on the C64, it was clear the map would need to scroll so that it would be exactly the same as the arcade. Therefore there would be no adjustments needed to the logic behind the movement of Pacman or the ghosts. On PAL I fake 60fps by running the game loop twice every 5th frame, while skipping the sound code every 6th frame on NTSC.<br/><br/>This initial version might not be quite there, but I have been working with some Pacman experts, including some of the few people in the world to play a perfect game and will hopefully continue to do so until the goal is reached. It only takes a pixel difference two minutes into a frame-perfect pattern\u00a0to throw things off, but of course you need to be a great player\u00a0to play the patterns in the first place and notice the difference.....for us casual players it should play near-identically to the arcade.<br/><br/>I even went as far as including an 8K lookup table that returns exactly the same sequence of random numbers as the arcade machine, which is often one area where conversions diverge as ghosts in 'frightened' mode make 'random' turns, but always in the same sequence.</p>\n<p>I also included the famous\u00a0kill screen that occurs when\u00a0completing level 255. This probably won't play 100% like the arcade game because a lot of its behaviour depends on the tile data layout of the arcade ROM, but then again, only a handful of people in the world are good enough to reach it!</p>\n<p>For more details on ghost AI, speeds, timers, and general strategy see the dossier.</p>\n<p>The game does function on NTSC machines\u00a0\u00a0but I recommend running on PAL if possible to avoid flickering. I will attempt to address the NTSC flickering in a future update.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Eric Akeson for his help and patience\u00a0in tracking down some particularly infuriating bugs over the past few months.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed3a7deaaad03122a73007c92722f0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
