And so, the Selestial Order send forth into Hellstorms divine skeletal vessels of hallowed Heavenly Keepers, to smite thy Hellion souls. You are one such Keeper... Will Earth fall to depravity? Will Heaven's purity remain? Sanctity rests with you...<strong>Gameplay</strong>Skelly Selest is a score-attack slash dash run 'n' gun-athon. It includes a variety of enemy wave-based pulse-pumping game modes with Steam score leaderboard support.<br/><br/><br/>Venture into the procedurally generated perdition depths of Hell, through Bone Plains, Flesh Gardens and the Soul Necropolis where you must face the huge monstrosities of the Arch Lichemancer and Deamonica Netherlord alongside their numerous hordes of sinful horrors. Luckily you'll stumble upon myriad of blessed item loot to bolster your fighting prowess and perhaps even rescue alternate characters and other unlockables to customise your visual and gameplay styles.<br/><br/>The game modes also include a pit arena survive-athon where you battle endless meanies, a gloomy dank dungeon crawl open to all beasties and bosses, and even a strategic collectable card game inspired by Final Fantasy 8's Triple Triad.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-10T20:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde12f7417c1fb2ae275da382b20efa3.jpg", "website": "http://caiysware.com/skelly-selest", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 39, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Digerati Distribution", "Caiysware"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digerati", "Caiysware"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
