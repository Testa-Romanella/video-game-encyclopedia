They're both useful, but in very different situations. As so, the player uses the two mouse buttons to control which weapon to fire. I decided to follow the \"Two Button Controls\" theme. In addition, the game features synchronisation with the music so the difficulty of the game is based on the music. I submitted it exactly 9 hours after the theme announcement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d0da1c5032f1fb1bbafd43768166dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["davidgomes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
