Download it today and transfer your old saves to it to continue playing in the newest version (or if you're knew to Broken Reality, just ignore this and enjoy).</p>\n\n<p><em>The world of Psema is a vast and dangerous one. When an entity known as \"Mother\" reveals to you that Psema's worshipped gods might not be what they seem, you set out on a journey to discover the \"Truth\", with no real idea of what that entrails, set on a path of betrayal, murder and all too real cruelty. Beware, ignorance is a bliss.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong><br/>-A really, really big world to explore.</p>\n<p>-4 different classes to choose from with vastly different gameplays. Your class choice will also affect a multitude of npc interactions, access to various areas and the special, class routes in its visual novel departments.</p>\n<p>-A highly detailed world, with tons of collectibles.</p>\n<p>-Music carefully selected based on a variety of factors to fit each situation and area of the game. Definitely keep your speakers on.</p>\n<p>-The world is not just Lovecraft-inspired. It IS Mythos based.</p>\n<p>-Hard, demanding battles. The game is by no means a breeze, but it won't cheat you out of a victory either.</p>\n<p>-Gameplay inspired from a combination of Witcher (1), Dark Souls, Eye: Divine Cybermancy, Planescape Torment, and World of Warcraft, with a tiny bit of Pokemon and Dating Sims thrown in.</p>\n<p>-Complex, deep character interactions. Debate, bribe, blackmail and flirt your way out of situations... Or just start cutting throats, though there are consequences to everything.</p>\n<p>-A multitude of open-ended quests, with even more being added on every patch. Your decisions can have consequences even tens of hours after making them.</p>\n<p>-The hardest of bosses are intelligent creatures. You might try offering them a better deal instead of fighting...?</p>\n\n<p>To get direct information about tha various updates of Broken Reality,\u00a0\u00a0along with my other projects, join my facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/HasturtheCreator/<br/></p>\n<p>If the download doesn't start from the download button of itch.io, download it directly from here:\u00a0</p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yProVWz_I7AFh00NX9_wjx0kpz6NWhkM/view?usp=shari...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19c/19c0957efae75980a9171a5fe6cc4c4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lord Rutsah"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
