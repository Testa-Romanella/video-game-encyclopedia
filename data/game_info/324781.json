The objective is to transfer all of the discs from the one tower to another. However, you cannot pick up more than one disc at a time, you can only pick up the top disc of each respective stack,\u00a0and you cannot place a larger disc on top of a smaller one.</p>\n<p>The so-called \"legend\" is that Buddhist monks have been playing Towers of Hanoi with 64 discs since ancient times. Once they complete the game, the world will end. This may sound dire, but to complete such a puzzle, it would take about 585 BILLION YEARS! That is multiple times longer than the life of our universe.</p>\n<p>I'm kind of fascinated with this puzzle so I\u00a0decided to make my own little version to play whenever I\u00a0want. Feel free to try it out for yourself!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-03T05:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecf2011f121a3a2beb53fdae44a29e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BurlapTheMonkey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
