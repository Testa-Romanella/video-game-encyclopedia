A world in which humanity has undergone a scientific and technical breakthrough and has gone beyond our solar system. Colonizing all the suitable neighboring planets we dared to interstellar travel, sending several spacecraft to distant stars to colonize their planets. And after many decades, they finally arrived there, starting a new story for humanity...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe success of the colonization of the planet depends on many factors, and the very first of them is the creation of suitable conditions for the man's stay on it. Scientists and engineers have created all the necessary complexes that will help the first colonizers step on the planet, but it takes time and effort. In order to provide safety to people, automatic climate change stations, suitable atmosphere generators and robots were sent to the planet first. Their goals are to monitor the processes and perform maintenance tasks, keeping stability of terraforming systems.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nScientists have counted all the factors that required for the successful colonization. But all the exploration probes and the satellites haven't seen the planet already contains some non-organic form of life, which was hidden deep below its surface...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player controls one of the drones that is part of the main landing module with the atmosphere generator. The main task is to protect this structure from enemies, which, due to their ferromagnetic nature, are trying to destroy it and other modules that operate with a lot of energy. Later, engineers suggested how to counteract thess Ferrites, as scientists called them. Overloading drone's own reactor, it can effectively neutralize these ferromagnetic creatures, without providing any damage to landing modules.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main generator creates an atmosphere inside a special energy dome, creating some kind of \"greenhouse\" that holds the air inside. Having reached the necessary minimum of oxygen, suitable for people's lives inside, the reactor can be stopped so as not to attract all the ferrites around.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTerraform the planet.<br/>\r\nProtects modules that are priceless for the mankind.<br/>\r\nExplore the planet and its inhabitants.<br/>\r\nImprove drones and modules to increase chances of successful colonization.<br/>\r\nFind your own tactics of confrontation with enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe future of the colony is in your hands!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/373255249688cbe7ff4d80fcecdeca59.jpg", "website": "http://soluxinteractive.com/ecopoiesis", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Solux Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Solux Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
