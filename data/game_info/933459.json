A bit of mischief ensues, and Coots finds herself trapped in an alternate version of the Wild West controlled by cowboy...doggos*?</p>\n<p>\"Huh. Weird.\"</p>\n<p>Dodge and weave your way through a three-stage onslaught and make your way back to Ludwig!</p>\n\r\nTechnically, this should be called \"Cowgirl Coots\", but we were just a little too late in the development process and didn't have enough time to swap the file names.
