Then here's some crap for you to do together.<br/></p>\n<p>Friends with Guns is a cool local multiplayer party game, unless you don't have friends or 2 xbox controllers. Then it's just a thing you saw online that bummed you out. I'm so sorry about that.</p>\n<p>This is just a prototype and a hella messy one at that. I'm starting from nothing and just going to keep constantly updating it until it's actually fun. Modes will come and go. Bugs will get fixed and then get worse later. Stay tuned if you want to watch that happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the art here is all asset store stuff and I'll do my best to link to the Creative Commons ones as I keep working on this. Maybe when it's done I'll make this into a full release with original art.
