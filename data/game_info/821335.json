You don\u2019t have any weapons, but there\u2019s a few dice with odd symbols on the ground\u2026<br/></p>\n<p>\u2026watch out for Lady Cluck, though.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Pick up the ability dice after they have come to rest to queue up another random spell. Each time you use a spell, you will also roll one of your ability dice. However, if you have used all your queued spells, you'll need to pick up one of the dice before you can attack again. When you land a hit, you will roll a number of d6s for damage based on how many enemies you hit and which attack you used. Once all the dice have finished rolling, damage will be calculated and applied to your foe.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game supports mouse and keyboard or a gamepad.</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or the left stick, aim with the mouse and the right stick, and fire with the LMB or the right trigger</p>\n<p><strong>Sound attributions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dice_Rolls_30cm by andresix (https://freesound.org/people/andresix/sounds/347806/)</li><li>Lightning (thunderbolt) by DominikBraun (https://freesound.org/people/DominikBraun/sounds/495525/)</li><li>splat 005 by\u00a0yottasounds (https://freesound.org/people/yottasounds/sounds/232135/)</li><li>whoosh04 by\u00a0FreqMan (https://freesound.org/people/FreqMan/sounds/25073/)</li><li>EXPLDsgn_Powerful Explosion 2.1_EM_(28lrs) by newlocknew (https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/625114/)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:48:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99bce77cbd446035e3978f384e20ddcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["josef01", "inkhorse", "klaro", "Kestrad"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
