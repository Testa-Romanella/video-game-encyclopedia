The browser version is a bit janky because the mouse control breaks whenever the mouse leaves the frame. Either play in full-screen or download the standalone versions. Couldn't figure out how to make the cursor invisible, sorry. This isn't an issue if you have Pico-8 and load the cart directly, but is an issue for web and standalone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mechanics are directly borrowed from the \"Pyoro T\" minigame included with\u00a0<em>Warioware Touched</em> on the Nintendo DS.\u00a0 I loved this little arcade game but it seems to be almost non-existent on Youtube, which is sad. It's real good!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c7443adbd1bf6862b74616586955799.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
