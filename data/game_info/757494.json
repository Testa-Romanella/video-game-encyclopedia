(the level restarts)</p>\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\n<p>Arrow keys = Move.</p>\n<p>\"S\" = Perform Action.</p>\n<strong>Score Mechanic:</strong>\n<p>You gain score by killing enemies, completing levels, hoarding gold and preserving crystal health.</p>\n<p>You must play the game from Level 1 to finish to be able to submit a score to the leaderboard. (ONLY OPERA GX)<br/></p>\n<p>Failing a level or restarting one resets your score to what it was when you first entered the level, so don't feel like everything is over if you fail a level or restart one.</p>\n<strong>Timelapse + Gameplay:</strong>\n(I had to cut out some stuff because of secret leaderboard keys and stuff so unfortunately there's a few hours missing in the timelapse)\n<strong>Jam Comments:</strong>\n<p>As usual, I went into this with nothing and made everything from scratch with the exception of the highscore stuff since an extension was apparently required for that.. but I ended up rewriting my own version of the extension anyway because of... reasons, so that ended up being semi from scratch as well.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the game didn't exactly turn out as I wanted and motivation was not exactly high this time around so this is what it ended up being.</p>\n<p>It was also my first time using the Opera GX export which was surprisingly painless with not that many issues so that was nice.</p>\n<p>Anyway, final verdict is:</p>\n<p>This could have been much better than it ended up being but it is what it is I guess, hopefully the game is fun for someone at least.</p>\n\n<p>Oh and I didn't quite get around to optimizing very much so there is a decent chance of lag happening on some levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:46:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f7b9654772f87d51ac9dea930d6c85d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apapappa"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
