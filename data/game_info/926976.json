{"id": 926976, "slug": "skirmish-1944", "name": "Skirmish 1944", "name_original": "Skirmish 1944", "description": "Skirmish : Normandy 44 is a turn-based strategy war game focusing on the D-Day US landings on Utah beach, Normandy, France on the 6th June 1944.<br/><br/>Presented in the style of a digital boardgame with detailed hex maps &amp; squad-level counters(infantry, tanks &amp; AT guns) to represent the combat arena.\u00a0<br/><br/>Dice rolls(d10) are used to resolve choices based on unit stats (such as skill or firepower); the game takes care of all the computations for you such as Line of Sight,  armour defence, suppression, smoke defence, etc., so you can focus on the tactical actions &amp; scenario objectives.<br/><br/>Auto-saving after every unit completes its actions, enables more casual playing if you desire.<br/><br/>The AI has been custom scripted for each map as each contains a particular feature (eg a sunken canal) or objectives (usually buildings).<br/><br/>Various player modes are available : <br/>1) play solitaire against the AI(easy, medium, hard settings)<br/>2) pass n play against another player on the same device<br/>3) Host or Join a 2 player online game - using public or private rooms<br/>4) Or observe AI vs AI<br/><br/>Double-sided &amp; tagged counters represent units - squads, teams, vehicles &amp; guns that move &amp; fight skirmishes over different maps to achieve victory either by eliminating the enemy or reaching/capturing/holding objectives.<br/><br/>Implementing a morale/suppression/reduction system to reflect battlefield stress and units being pinned down. This allows you to use the infantry tactics Find/Fix/Flank to good effect.<br/><br/>Scenarios represent typical skirmishes fought in the invasion like the deadly Utah beach landing, canal crossings, hidden hedgerows, town fighting. Units need to take advantage of defensive terrain and spend action points wisely to avoid elimination as moving will likely draw enemy opportunity fire from unspent actions.<br/><br/>Utilising an action points (AP) mechanic for units that allows players to perform tasks such as movement or firing, turning, laying smoke, etc.<br/><br/>An optional fog of war (FOW) can be set for each scenario that can hide enemy counters out of visual range. Additionally, a line of sight (LOS) system can conceal enemy counter details from view and stop them from being targeted even if seen.<br/><br/>Each scenario takes place over a number of game turns composed of phases executed in this order: <br/>. Start Turn<br/>. Reinforcement Phase - new units arrive (eg Landing craft)<br/>. Action Phase - players alternate counters to action, so prioritise according to strategy!<br/>. Melee Phase - same hex units fight in more lethal close combat<br/>. Rout Phase - unsupported units may need to retreat<br/>. Recovery Phase - suppression is reduced, smoke fades<br/>. End Turn - victory objectives are checked<br/><br/>Before starting the first turn there is a Setup Phase to allow counters to be rearranged within areas of the map. You can even add additional counters or place in non-entry hexes.<br/><br/>A 18+ page online manual is available detailing the gameplay &amp; computations.<br/><br/>The first IAP scenario is now available featuring the US paratroop drop on Ste-Mere-Eglise. This map features street buildings to offer close combat urban fighting and a new LOS experience.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53c55b1b4a3746c2568be9ee48bdc99e_9sw0Ype.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["anthony saunders"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Educational"], "publishers": ["anthony saunders"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
