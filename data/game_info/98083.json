The ingredients change purpose every match, meaning that each game is a new association puzzle to figure out faster than your opponent. The first player to seven correct solutions wins the match.<br/><br/>Can be played with two controllers, or with two players at a single keyboard!<br/>P1 Movement: WASD (Analog Stick) / P1 Interact: Left Ctrl (A Button)<br/>P2 Movement: Arrow Keys (Analog Stick) / P2 Interact: Right Ctrl (A Button)<br/><br/>Designed and built in (under) 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2016 following the theme: <em>'Ritual!'</em><br/><br/>Programmed by Tom Farro (@FomTarro), featuring art assets from John Guerra (@johndaguerra) and Dillon DeSimone (@gunpuncher)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/029b0e25d8b18e59cd45cd72aefd3f31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fomtarro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
