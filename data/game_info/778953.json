Getting hit even once will kill you and make you redo the level from the start.</p>\n<p>The goal appears as a checker-pattern tile in the ground. Once you reach this, you have completed the stage.</p>\n<p>Features of the game currently include: Breakable Bricks, Coins, Enemies, Checkpoints, Item Blocks.</p>\n<p>Many of the game's planned features are not yet implemented as the developers have had limited time to create this current alpha version. The game is currently just a proof of concept of what it will be like in the future.</p>\n<p>You will not yet find any Checkpoints, or Item Blocks in the game, but they will be added at a later date.</p>\n<p>Standard platformer controls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Code - ERmilburn02</p>\n<p>Design - TJC_Plays</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T10:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b9c5b3b2a96cececf415f6c1f6fd455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ERmilburn02", "TJC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
