{"id": 528621, "slug": "future-corporations", "name": "Future Corporations", "name_original": "Future Corporations", "description": "<p>Future Corporations is a <em>hardcore</em> business board game. It\u2019s hardcore\u2019ness is not in complicated rules, no. As in other economics board games you might know, you roll the dice and buy properties to gather a monopoly. The monopoly gives you a source of income and drives rivals to the bankrupt. Unlike others, the game balance and mechanics are done so that your skills worth much higher than luck: the brain wins the dice. <br/></p>\n<p>Closest games are: Galactic Magnate, Monopoly.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Future Corporations got <strong>no single-player versus AI mode</strong> and likely never will. We believe that board games are only enjoyable when playing with real humans. So, Futureco offers the following modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Offline Hotseat: play with friends passing your device, do the business on a sofa or in the airport</li><li>Online with Friends: host a private room, share the link, play with up to four mates</li><li>Online Global: defeat random players from all over the world and become the #1 magnate</li></ul>\n<p>What\u2019s cool is that Future Corporations have a web-based version so that you can play with friends instantly even if they have no game application installed. Even on mobile browsers.</p>\n<p>Future Corporation appeals to real business people because (1) the hardcore rules also organically limit the game session time to 30-40 mins, and (2) they feel their rationality will help trounce you. Oh, they are mistaken. Get some experience in global online games and surprise your arrogant friends ;)</p>\n<p>Last but not least, Future Corporations are made in a retrofuturism theme! Do you know how the Future will look like? We don\u2019t! But the fantasts of the 1960s knew what you would see in the 2050s. Intrigued? Download the game!</p>\n<p>Not convinced? OK\u2026, do you like flying cars? Yes, hovercars. They are fantastic, and we have some. See you in the Future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T07:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b77/b77e0b497c4f1355c508f66290442a8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AXFX"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
