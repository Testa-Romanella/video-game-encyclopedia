Only a chosen few can control it. But only one can save us from it. You are the one. You are Nevin and you&#39;re armed with the most radical weapon ever. It&#39;s a shape-shifting PolySuit, and it can even stop time itself. You&#39;re armed and you&#39;re dangerous. But you&#39;re going to need every advantage you can get, because you&#39;re fighting across Proteus, a planet whose very surface is alive - and it&#39;s controlled by Paavo, an evil mastermind who seeks to annihilate you.
