Rooms can contain different kinds of monsters that you need to avoid. Complete the game by collecting every rubbish item from every room.<br/><br/>This game is an almost entirely procedurally generated Jet Set Willy clone. I made it as a homage to one of my favorite games as a child, Jet Set Willy on the Commodore 64. It is made in honour of the great work by Matthew Smith (creator of Jet Set Willy)  and Shahid Ahmad (creator of the C64 version). The aesthetic of Flufy Cleaning Co. is based heavily on the Commodore 64 version and uses the C64 colour palette, screen resolution and C64 emulated sound and music. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Game Features:</p>\n<p>- Procedurally generated worlds, rooms, enemies and textures.<br/>- Pre-set game modes and also custom game mode, allowing custom world sizes, custom seeds and toggle cheats.<br/>- 8 Playable characters.<br/>- Keyboard and Controller support.<br/>- Lots and lots of Commodore nostalgia.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Flufy Cleaning Co. vs Jet Set Willy:</p>\n<p>Some differences between this version and the original are worth noting here.</p>\n<p>Accessing stairs in the original JSW was done by walking into the stairs from the bottom to enter a stair walking state, jumping on to a stair case would allow the player to walk through it and pass the stair case.  In FCC the player will walk on stairs if they land on them while falling, a player on the up arc of a jump will pass through stairs, and walking past stairs from the bottom will pass through them also.</p>\n<p>The player in FCC can push down to drop through passable blocks and staircases, this is not possible in original JSW. The original JSW had hand designed levels to allow the player to 'move downward' in the room by having specific drops or platform layout. This was considerably difficult to  generate procedurally with 100% accessibility in every room so allowing a drop down through soft blocks was an easier solution, it's fun too.</p>\n<p>There is an option in FCC to allow invulnerability when entering a room, this avoids the infamous 'death loop' of the Willy games. You have the option to turn this off if you wish for the true nostalgic experience.</p>\n<p>There is no deadly blocks or swinging ropes in FCC, sorry, maybe in an update.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>For all the testing and feedback, room names, code ideas, support and inspiration.<br/></p>\n<p>Mark Mauer at Justwall Games.<br/>https://justwall.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Mika Pyon<br/>http://www.niyotan.org/mikapyon/<br/></p>\n<p>Ryan Kwok<br/>https://fullsparedice.itch.io</p>\n<p>Thank you,\u00a0 this game wouldn't be what it is without all your help.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Design, code and graphics by Albatross Wirehead.</p>\n<p>Additional Character GFX<br/>Marcus by JustWall Games<br/>Ryan by Ryan Kwok<br/>Mika by Mika Pyon<br/>Izzy by OddSocks https://oddsocks.itch.io/<br/><br/>Music made using Reaper and the 38911 bytes VST plugin by Odo Synths.
