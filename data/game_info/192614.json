Players must move the square horizontally to go in between pipes to survive. If players bump into pipes, they lose! Players get breaks between waves, and the number of pipes in a wave increases as the number of waves increases. </p>\n<p>There are two game modes to choose from: a single-player mode and a local two-player multiplayer game mode. In the single-player mode, there is only one player that goes between pipes to score points. The player must go in between as many pipes as possible before eventually dying. In the local two-player multiplayer game mode, there are two players that each control a colored square. Each player controls their square to go in between pipes.
