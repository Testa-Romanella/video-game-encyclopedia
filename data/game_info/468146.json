Shoot to move, but don't bounce around too much, or you might get out of control!</p><p>(UPDATE: I discovered, after submissions were over, that level 4 has a bug where you spawn right by the goal. Sorry about that!)<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions: Click and drag to shoot and move. Red and Black walls will bounce you off, and if you hit them too hard your speed can quickly multiply! Press 'R' to reset to the position you last shot from, but you only have a few of these per level. Enemies will come at you, and if they touch you it's game over. Get to the goal to advance to the next level!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>All artwork and design was done by me.
