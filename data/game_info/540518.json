These 3 different UI techniques can be visualised in many different\u00a0ways.</p>\n<p>My reasoning for choosing this type of project stems from not touching too much within the User Interface and User experience sector in games giving me a lack of knowledge of that component, with hope that completing a project of this extent will enhance my knowledge within that sector therefore having multiple skill-sets and knowledge for different areas within the subject.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\r\nMove Up, Down, Left, RightW,A,S,DLook Up, Down, Left RightMouse MovementCompass UpLeft ClickInventory Upi\r\n<p>Player health can be depleted by going near the red cube. Also the spatial UI is represented by an A* pathfinding bot that can be seen moving to the waypoint leaving a trail in which the player can follow. Items are used by left clicking them in the inventory system.</p><p>My initial plan was to ensure I had the 3 different UIs successfully implemented in which I have done. To add more to this<br/>project would be to significantly improve the Inventory system by making it more appealing to the player and possibly<br/>converting it to a diegetic type of UI. Other aspects include<br/>more shaders and post processing effects and making it so it<br/>looks more game like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:53:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d4790676e904053bb81783587afb11cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arran D Smedley"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
