It's a classic (really) short story, realized by hundred of developers using several different languages.</p>\n<p>So it was an easy choice to use it to test the native C64 graphic text adventure I'm working on (with the hope\u00a0to realize a bigger game).</p>\n<p>And even if it's a game that you can finish in less than a minute I hope you can have a bit of\u00a0fun :-)</p>\n<p>I'm also releasing\u00a0the <strong>adventure game source script </strong>in case you're curious to see how this <strong>IF </strong>language is different from others.</p>\n<p>A couple of notes:</p>\n<p>- talking about <strong>IF </strong>I'm in love with <strong>ALAN </strong>(http://www.alanif.se/) since its first version - and it's really clear that I took a lot from their work - just mixing it with my other experiences done with <strong>Defold </strong>for <strong>Point-and-Click</strong> games.</p>\n<p>- if you want to know more about the original game (and its other better implementations) you can have a look at this page:\u00a0http://www.firthworks.com/roger/cloak/</p>\n<p>- if you like this kind of game, for C64, I strongly suggest you check out\u00a0<strong>The Curse of Rabenstein</strong> https://8bitgames.itch.io/rabenstein\u00a0- it's a wonderful game I've played several times that inspired me to try to do my own engine. This, even if my taste for this specific subset of adventure games was born in the 80s thanks to some (I think) not internationally known Italian adventure games published on tape and available\u00a0in newsstores (https://www.edicola8bit.com/riviste.php?console=c64&amp;collana=adventure_64).\u00a0</p>\n<p>- this game has been developed using\u00a0<strong>CC65\u00a0</strong>compiler (https://www.cc65.org/) - it's made in\u00a0<strong>C</strong> with some inline <strong>asm</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- also this time, I want to\u00a0thank\u00a0<strong>Eric Akeson</strong>\u00a0for his time and support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/acc25d9c339340701d473f33aa6294b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
