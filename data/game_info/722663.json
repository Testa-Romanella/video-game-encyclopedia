Your home is a wasteland scoured by winds blowing in from a caustic sea. Most large mammals are extinct, and insects have filled their roles.<br/><br/>You are a merchant traveling this land in search of profit. Each character you play starts with a randomly generated history and traits. And eventually, each character's career will come to an end \u2014 whether through successful retirement or tragic death.<br/><br/>The game remembers everything you do, and the world is persistent across characters. As a consequence of your actions, civilization will slowly grow and rebuild. Accomplishments accrued across any number of characters will unlock new cities, new crew units, new challenges, and so on.<br/><br/>There is no fixed storyline. Instead, you have a setting, a set of gameplay mechanics, and complete freedom to do with that what you will.<br/><br/>Core features:<br/><ul><li>Travel, trade, and defend your cargo from dangers.<br/></li><li>Improve your skills through usage.<br/></li><li>Find and explore places that are worth plundering.<br/></li><li>Build relationships with city notables, and co-operate with them on various schemes.<br/></li><li>Rebuild a persistent world across multiple lifetimes.<br/></li><li>Make trade-offs in encounters that are purely decision-driven, and avoid grindy minigames.<br/></li><li>Enjoy a high-information user interface that doesn't ask you to remember things unnecessarily.</li></ul><br/>Example challenges:<br/><ul><li>Local climate calamities.<br/></li><li>Giant insects, bandits, and much worse.<br/></li><li>Each character will automatically retire if they live long enough; this does not leave enough time to develop all possible skills.<br/></li><li>Networks of supply and demand are randomized between playthroughs.<br/></li><li>You can't stay in a trade route rut, because trading with the same cities too much will make it less profitable.<br/></li><li>You and your crew can become injured or sick \u2014 and possibly die as a result.<br/></li><li>The locals that you trade and scheme with have minds of their own, and may betray you.<br/></li><li>Performance-enhancing symbiotes may seem like a great idea, but can lead to unfortunate side-effects.<br/></li><li>Oh, and there are also demons. They complicate everything.</li></ul><br/>This is not an action-oriented game. Time doesn't pass unless you're doing something, and there are no real-time challenges. Instead, gameplay is strictly about the making of intelligent trade-offs in an open-world setting with many potential courses of action.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a05566b2ce084fcaea6fc26daca7f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Iron Boar Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
