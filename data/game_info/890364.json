It's far from polished or perfect, and barely a game, but that's okay!</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had ideas for power-ups, more enemy variety etc. but that was a lot to do for my first dip into this. The whole point of joining the 20-second jam was so that I would be unable to pack in too much content, and just finish something simple but fun to play. I\u00a0learned a lot doing so, and maybe you'll find it fun!</p>\n<p>----------------------------</p>\n<p>In no particular order, I would like to acknowledge the content used within this game.
