{"id": 127931, "slug": "raw-amethyst", "name": "Raw Amethyst", "name_original": "Raw Amethyst", "description": "<p>This game is puzzle where you must collect all gems on board. It is similar to Boulder Dash or Supaplex, but its going to be harder in final version. Currently it has 40 levels and option to make maps in .bmp editor, save and load game, and record/play demos.</p><p>Now I have updated the version of game - there is save/load form, its packed into install file and mostly important - the program crashing after 'help' command is fixed. Also, recently I disabled autosaves. It was pain in arse to click through 50 autosaves, so its better without them. Recently the saves are redone to 10 hard slots with unchangeable name. Fixed the error with occassional crash. If happens again, let me know. Download version 0.5. I dont support anything else anymore.</p><p>You can also visit my page: www.macinsoftware.borec.cz<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cf/3cfc899576ae9bf81fbd83e04dd041d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Macin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
