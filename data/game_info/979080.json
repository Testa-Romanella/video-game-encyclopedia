Using your common sense will be enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To make the objects you create meet expectation, drawing process needs to be precise.<br/>Perhaps you cannot draw that accurately right away, but you have countless opportunities to try, and trying is the charm of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sometimes you may at a loss of what to do next. <br/>Well, just jump out of the box. Things look impossible or ridiculous may turn out to be the right answer finally.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Through logical reasoning, you can predict what will happen after you create one object.<br/>As the game progresses, you will encounter more complex scenes, but on the other hand, unlock more features.<br/>Enjoy the process of thinking and you will gain a lot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T07:03:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e29c80fa592ddfd10888a043ef2000.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artipro"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Artipro"], "esrb_rating": null}
