In this infinite runner, you <strong>telepor</strong>t instead of jumping. This means you can teleport through obstacles, but be careful, teleport too soon and you might end up in a wall.</p>\n<p>Void Runner was created in collaboration with my brother. We were inspired by other infinite runners but wanted to take a different approach to how you avoid obstacles. We hope you enjoy playing Void Runner as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d49e7dad258fbd100ee4bc81522d7010.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VixMix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
