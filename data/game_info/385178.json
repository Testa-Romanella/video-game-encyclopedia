Luckily, you have your rechargeable flashlight and handgun to help\u00a0 you\u00a0burn the shadows and survive. You need to survive 3 increasingly difficult rounds by killing the shadows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to move, Left click to shoot, Right click to toggle flashlight, and R to reload your handgun.</p>\n<p>Tips:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your Flashlight recharges when not in use. It can burn and slow down the shadows.\u00a0 The bullets fire from the muzzle of the gun and not directly at the cursors position.\u00a0You have limited ammunition. Firing your gun can help you spot shadows coming at you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>This was made in less than a week for the Godot Wild Jam # 14 using the Godot game engine version 3.1</p>\n<p>Maybe you can consider the game as spooky especially if you turn down the brightness, eh. Everything in the game was made by only me and this is my first game jam. I know the art is terrible; I am bad with colors. Hope you enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d1/7d14863a44f927dd99a205de1ada8089.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Flaming Thunder"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
