Current residents are very unwelcoming so you may want to \"Change Their Mind\".</p>\n<p><strong>Kill 200 Zombies as fast as you can. Fastest times get on the Leaderboard.</strong></p>\n<p>Or you can just roam the island killing zombies along the way. There is Zark City, a suburb, mountain and forest areas\u00a0, plus a hidden place for you to find and reclaim.</p>\n<p>This is an<strong>\u00a0Early Access FPS Zombie Hell Shooter</strong>. Normal mode is a time based zombie shooter where the fastest player times get on the Public Leaderboard (Leaderboard fully functioning and implemented) Each run should last around 15 to 30 minutes. Horde mode is where continuous waves of zombies spawn and your objective is to alive as long as possible(No leaderboard implemented yet).\u00a0That is the main game loop right now but I am working to add survival aspects for those that want to roam the Island.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p>W A S D - keys for movement / (Hold SHIFT to run)\u00a0</p>\n<p>1 - Pistol<br/></p>\n<p>2 - Assault Rifle</p>\n<p>6 - Flashlight</p>\n<p>R - Reload</p>\n<p>T - Inspect Weapon</p>\n<p>U - Holster Weapon</p>\n<p>P - Pause the Game</p>\n<p>M - Go Back to Main Menu</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Left Button\u00a0- Fire Weapon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right Button - Aim</p>\n<p>Move your mouse to direct your view.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Player Notes:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are crates(Ammo and Med) throughout the island, just touch the crates and stats will be replenished. Note that If you use a crate, it will be unavailable for 5 minutes so wait until you absolutely need it.</p>\n<p>There are three main areas in the island. Zark City, the adjacent suburban area and the forest area in the center of the island.</p>\n<p>If you are roaming the Zark Island, there is a hidden area that you may stumble upon. Be careful,\u00a0 there could be a couple zombies claiming that location.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest. This is Early Access so there some things to be worked on and added.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You may have also noticed some commercial assets. Yes, I use assets. I am developing this solo on my free time(i.e. I work full time and I suck at art). \u00a0I just started this project around March 2020 so please go easy on me.\u00a0 :-)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Has only been tested on Windows machines.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Please email me at: texmoco@gmail.com if you have any questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Buyers Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>I will be implementing a program wherein buyers have the option of having their names or screen names put into the Credits Screen. Maybe a \"Funding Members\" section. This should be implemented on my next upload.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T04:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f92d065afd973016c7088fa21941f634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["andogames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
