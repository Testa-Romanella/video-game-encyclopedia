With each discovery made, the forest reveals more and more of its colors, each memory relieved making new flowers bloom in the world.</p>\n<p>Florere Memoriae is a student project made by our team at Abertay University. It had a development cycle of just under 10 weeks.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Producer:</strong></p>\n<p>Mathew Lornie:\u00a0https://mathewl8.wixsite.com/mathewlornie-games\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer:</strong></p>\n<p>Linxiao (Damien) He</p>\n<p><strong>Level/Narrative Designer:</strong></p>\n<p>Bailey Sabin:</p>\n<p><strong>UI Designer:</strong></p>\n<p>Harry McGuigan</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Designer:</strong></p>\n<p>Yuxi Chen</p>\n<p><strong>3D Artist:</strong></p>\n<p>Elena Severson:\u00a0https://elenatexturesandmore.weebly.com/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T11:55:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66f4f23ca739a24d09ee573708b7e3a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BaileyS", "RandomSalmon", "Mathewl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
