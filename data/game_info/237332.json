The dragons lived amongst themselves in the mountains, far from human and ogre civilization. The dragons were known to be peaceful to those that were nice, and vicious against those who threatened or attacked their home.<br/><br/>One day, a catastrophic event destroyed the dragon lair. Ogres from all over the land had gathered to capture the city of dragons, and the gold beneath the mountains. They had gathered together, bought advanced weapons and nets from all over the land, and attacked the mountains from all sides. Surprised by attack and outnumbered but unwilling to give up their home, the dragons fought bravely to defend their city. Countless dragons and ogres were killed. In the end, the dragons had no choice but to flee their lair in defeat. <br/><br/>As the ogres celebrated their victory, they begin their search for the valuable gold. What they did not see or know, was there was a special dragon egg hidden in the safety of a nest.<br/><br/>The dragon soon hatched and its eyes only saw the bloodshed of recent battle.
