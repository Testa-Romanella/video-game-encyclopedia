Let's try and visualize what collecting it all might look like.</p>\n<p>It's a very simple, chill and relaxing game. Sit back, control your boat and clean the ocean to the jazzy music made by TKIMUSE.</p>\n<p>Either control your boat with WASD or use the actual controls with your mouse. It's all possible! You can also use tab or click on top-left trash count to open the data and upgrade window. You can upgrade several different aspects:</p>\n<ul><li>Max Speed</li><li>Acceleration</li><li>Turn Angle</li><li>Turning Speed</li><li>Net Level</li></ul>\n<p>And yes, you can change the weight units from metric to imperial.</p>\n\n<p>Try it out and let me know what you think. Also consider donating to #TeamSeas!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T04:49:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e38425b50940e49e0725d01985b8e8e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hunterson Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
