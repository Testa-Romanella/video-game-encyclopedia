Speak to the locals, sift their truths from their lies, or find other ways to draw further information from them...</p>\n<p>On the 5th morning someone will hang, make sure you know who the witch is by then!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Left Click - Interact<br/>Right Click - Return to the map<br/>Esc - Quit</p>\n<p>Being from Edinburgh I knew of the North Berwick Witch Trials but it was really harrowing doing research for this project. There may be scenes representing torture that some people may find disturbing. I explored this largely through the sound design, which had a more visceral and emotional reaction for me.</p>\n<p>For this jam I thought I'd try going back to 2D art and Game Maker for a change. Appologies if there are bugs, it's been years since I used it and a lot has changed! Just drop me a message if you encounter any and I'll see what I can do.</p>\n<p>You can also listen to the soundtrack on youtube:</p>\n<p>OST - Daemonologie<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T06:06:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c7ab54741561716c525d69e3d16ddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["katanalevy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
