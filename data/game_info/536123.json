{"id": 536123, "slug": "slick-adventures-the-warehouse", "name": "Slick Adventures: The Warehouse", "name_original": "Slick Adventures: The Warehouse", "description": "<p>Join Slick as he takes on numerous bizarre adventures and find a way to get out of them in Slick Adventures series! This time, control him through his first adventure; getting out of a warehouse he never remembered getting into.<br/></p>\n<p>Point and click your way out of the room, search for clues, and combine useful items to earn Slick's right of getting out of the room.</p>\n<p>The game only uses 2 buttons to play (left and right mouse button), so even your parents can try to tackle Slick Adventures games!</p>\n<p>----------||----------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Click - Interact with an object/inventory item.</p>\n<p>Right Click - Observe something. Useful to gain clues for puzzles.</p>\n<p>*Dragging inventory items to one another can combine them to make more useful items!</p>\n<p>*Click on an inventory item, then click on an object on screen to attempt to use that item\u00a0on said object.</p>\n<p>*Right click on empty space to deselect your inventory item.</p>\n<p>----------||----------</p>\n<p>This is my first ever game that I tried creating myself without the aid of a tutorial. 80% of in-game assets is done by me, with the exception of some built-in Adventure Game Studio scripts and sound effects that I got from Zapsplat.com. It lacks a few features, such as an options menu since I have yet to learn how to implement it, but I'll make sure I can implement such things as a simple volume control and fullscreen mode next time I make a game with the same engine.</p>\n<p>This game is also a fun little project to see what I'm capable of when learning how to make a game from 0 knowledge since before this I've only ever been making games that already has a tutorial on how to make them.</p>\n<p>Finally, I hope you have a bit of fun playing the first entry for what may become a series of point &amp; click adventure games revolving the character, Slick. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T05:56:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5cfbb3ddd8747c0bda400226576fbe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tr0janH0rse"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
