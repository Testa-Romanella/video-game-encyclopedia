The two main groups are the\u00a0Cervinae, including the\u00a0muntjac, the\u00a0fallow deerand the\u00a0chital, and the\u00a0Capreolinae, including the\u00a0elk,\u00a0reindeer\u00a0(caribou), the\u00a0Western roe deer, and the\u00a0moose. Some species are solitary, and most live in groups. These are harems, where a male gathers several females, produces offspring with them, and does not tolerate the presence of another male, with whom he comes to fight when the mating season.<br/>We love animals and let the need for hunting remains in this game.
