The Nazis are close to victory, so England sets up a psychic intelligence agency. As a\u00a0Psychic Interrogator recruit, Julia Chalmer pulls a stream of\u00a0magic through her heart to cast spells on detainees and learn what they are hiding. Also, awkward conversations with colleagues.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created for the Houdini 2020 7 day game jam, with the theme of Don't Panic. I scoped down a little from my initial intentions but am fairly happy with what I could get done in evenings and a weekend.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left mouse: everything</p>\n<p>Right mouse: tutorial text overlay during gameplay</p>\n<p><strong>Tutorial text:</strong></p>\n<p>Swipe magic through your heart's veins until it reaches a destination spell.</p>\n<p>Click down only on the beat to avoid stress.</p>\n<p><em>Also, you can wait a beat or so before the magic goes backwards. To get it to switch direction, wait until it has gone past a junction. The location of the mouse or magic does not matter, only the direction you swipe. \"On the beat\" means when the triangular beat cursor is lit up.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Cheat/ debug controls</strong> (not recommended due to bugginess):<br/></p>\n<p>Press 1 for next gameplay sequence, 2 for next cutscene. This is not reliable!</p>\n<p>Spells can be cast with the first letter of their name.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game: Patrick Reece<br/>Sound FX: Freesound.org<br/>Music: Bensound<br/>People: artbreeder<br/>Fonts: 1001fonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c82f7e263d96d4f9e5a40e3254e999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["reecpj"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
