For each turn, a card is generated, along with a line of text and two options. The two options you receive influence a number of resources your station is managing. The goal is to not have too little or too much of a resource. In other words, you want to have a balance of all of them. As you progress, more resources become available to you. Also, as you play, you have the opportunity to collect items, which will trigger small scenarios that add variation to the game.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Simple and casual gameplay loop<br/></li><li>Multiple sets of choices for each Cycle<br/></li><li>Earnable items that unlock scenarios<br/></li><li>Simulated stations with randomized ship traffic</li></ul><br/><br/>Episodes will be released on a monthly basis.
