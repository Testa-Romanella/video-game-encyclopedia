There are three modes,\u00a0Training, Quiz, and Endless. Each one being a different way to practice stage positions in a 3D space on a 3D stage.</p>\n\n<p>While the code was pretty simple for this game, most of my work went into research to make sure all of my stage position names were correctly represented and creating a theater using nothing but cubes, one free 3D model, and textures. Also I\u00a0used this opportunity to comment and document my code better than other games I've made in the past.<br/><br/><br/>With this project I learned educational game development, game design, UI design, educational research, and level design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T07:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a26b899b9367b7421b548f942710c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jensen Tucker"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
