Left-click to place your tiles. Right-Click to rotate. Fill all spaces in a row to clear that line.</p>\n<p>Note: You can place your tiles below other tiles if there\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>Update:\u00a0I added a Post Jam build for Windows that makes it easier to get to bigger pieces, and has some new scoring along with other changes. HTML5 is still running the 48 hour version since the game jam voting is still going on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/489/489157e2b1872015177f4874d8e5ba45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DifferentName"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
