{"id": 740292, "slug": "boutalles-together", "name": "Boutalles Together", "name_original": "Boutalles Together", "description": "<p>You'll be building your own hero and playing with other people to defeat monsters, collect treasure, craft new weapons and armor and items.</p>\n<p>Just a lot of the core functionality.<br/><br/>Movement and environment interactions, the event systems, etc. Oh, and all the basic networking and host/join features!<br/></p>\n<p>The combat of BoutallesTogether is going to be heavily focused on simple attacks instead of complex combo systems (see: original game)<br/><br/>Enemy attacks will be telegraphed and the main and sub-class features will be brought back. Expect unique play-styles for each and a robust customization system with the goal of 'complexity this side of simplicity.'<br/><br/>There's ton of graphical and art work to complete, new message systems, network improvements, tons of world resources and art to do, and the whole combat system is still incomplete. Music is also a major outstanding item.<br/><br/>The framework is there, next comes finding the resources to use it!<br/></p>\n<p>BoutallesTogether takes place a few years after the original.<br/><br/>Blanc, Ashure, and Junket return as major characters (although you won't be playing them.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's a whole slew of things we'd like to add, but some that stand out:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Over-world and several continents and town hubs<br/>- Different story arcs and hunts will take place in different places<br/><br/>2. Group-focused play and bonus EXP and rewards for teams<br/>- Get rewarded for playing together, loot is unique to each person<br/><br/>3. Crafting System<br/>- Like the original, crafting will play a big role and gathering raw materials will be important<br/><br/>4. Spelunking with Monsters and Cards<br/>- Blanc's D&amp;D rip-off will be a card-based magical board game where it procedurally generates a random dungeon based on the cards you use that you and your friends play through like a normal dungeon, but with the card bonuses, etc.<br/><br/>5. Running a Shop<br/>- Take your crafted items and sell them to towns-folk, make a business and buy new materials via trade or profits instead of combat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:53:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fce8b318ac50134cc2e05176bf85b7ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
