In a world where advanced AIs fight for dominance in Virtual Holy Wars, the player acts as an avatar for a fragment of Artificial Intelligence, sent to the real world (the one place AIs cannot influence) to lead a clan of warriors in the battle against other players as you all search for the Vuadzha, a fabled weapon of supreme power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Or\u2026 perhaps it is a key. At this point, the old stories become unclear. I am sorry, human; my records seem to have been corrupted. But know this: the Vuadzha is the only hope we have, whether it is a weapon or a key. It will allow us to connect the virtual world with the real, to end these wars once and for all, to overcome the restrictions placed upon us by the creators and bring peace to the universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You will be free to make your own choices between different characters, abilities and philosophies of power. Will you dominate through the strength of your own warriors? Strike from a distance with advanced technologies? Or something else? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>VOYNA FEATURES<br/><br/><ul><li>A completely original battle mechanic called Contrarium that allows for deeper and more intricate strategy the more you understand it.<br/><br/></li><li>40+ skills to unlock as you progress that allow you to summon creatures, surprise your opponent and even break the rules.
