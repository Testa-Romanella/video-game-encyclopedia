It will just keep going until you die.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A streamlined game\u00a0about finding treasure in a dungeon.<br/>It's a roguelike.</p>\n<p>The character's graphic is a placeholder - the name of the game is, too. Taken from the appearance of the placeholder graphic.</p>\n<p>The design philosophy is to keep the game very simplistic. I will not be adding any player stats or level ups, or detailed combat, larger levels, or more complex controls. Everything is kept manageable in scope so you can assess each level as a problem to solve and execute your plan. I hope you have fun playing it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Current features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Randomly generated levels</li><li>Inventory</li><li>Survival and hunger</li><li>Tutorial</li></ul>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Prioritised road map:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Spawn inventory items</li><li>Locked exits/keys</li><li>Checkpoints/shops</li><li>More inventory items</li><li>Difficulty scaling</li><li>More tilesets</li><li>Enemies</li><li>Combat equipment</li><li>More tilesets</li><li>Shoehorned storyline</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/8373c9c30005e2ebbef81fd6538ee5d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
