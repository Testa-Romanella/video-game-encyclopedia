Sometimes snow flakes get delayed from reaching their destination.  Logically, many would think that air currents and swirling winds cause the delay.  Most do not realize that snow flakes actually use tactics to slow down others.  They push each other.  The snow flakes, that lose, stay at the current air level.  After pushing different numbers of competing flakes, a snow flake can fall to the next air level.  The closer to the destination, the harder the competition gets.  it is rumored that the flakes can even form teams.</p><p>This is the adventure of a specific snow flake, named Sneaux, which is pronounced snow Sometimes Cajuns have fun changing English words that end with the 'Oh' sound by replacing the 'o' or 'ow' with 'eaux' or 'aux'.
