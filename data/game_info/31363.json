Shoot your way through 6 levels of asteroids avoiding enemy and collecting weapon power-ups and face end-of-level bosses to progress. Features complete and annoying wrap-around mechanic, physics, a selection of weapons with 5 level-ups, end of level boss, enemy ships that shoot back and an amazing 2 dimensions of top down shoot-em-up action. Can be controlled with keyboard (default), keyboard &amp; mouse (tricky), or Xbox One controller (definitely the best control method).", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T05:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d7f64dce00288fe1c6cb89066f4d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Syrox Developments", "Boat Drinks", "Play Asteroids"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Play Asteroids"], "esrb_rating": null}
