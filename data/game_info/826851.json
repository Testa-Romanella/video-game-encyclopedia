Since is just arcade, the story is not that important but we are planning on use the same characters in our next releases!<br/>\r\nYou have three hearts in the beginning of every play, and after some kills you can obtain some hearts from the enemies. You have an unlimited amount of time and you have to get the highest score possible before losing all your hearts.<br/>\r\nThere are nine characters (one of them is locked, so you need to unlock them!) in total, everyone has a different and unique skill that you can use to kill enemies in a easier way!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T05:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/94591dcde063bbef0b358ff504ddcbd8.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/bclstudio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BCL studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BCL studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
