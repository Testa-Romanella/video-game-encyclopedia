I press<strong> Call</strong> to confirm and pass to the CPU.</li><li>The CPU trusts that I am not a lier and rolls a 1 and a 2 - That's\u00a0<strong>Meyer</strong>!</li><li>I trust my gut and\u00a0<strong>Call Bluff\u00a0</strong>before I roll -\u00a0The CPU <strong>did</strong>\u00a0 roll the\u00a0<strong>Meyer\u00a0</strong>and that means the CPU gets a point. If the CPU had bluffed P1 would get the point.</li><li>The rounds restarts and that's how you play\u00a0<strong>Meyer</strong></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:23:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce2/ce22d360cb211c4ce2acc37fd99d3c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lysergicmike"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
