The game takes a realistic, un-filtered, and at times uncomfortably personal look at depression and anxiety disorder through the eyes of someone dealing with these conditions, promoting understanding and sharing the experience with a wider audience. The game deals with many themes related to depression and anxiety: worry, loneliness, and self-deprecating thoughts, but also hope and finding the strength, when all seems lost, to keep going. Made in a heavily-hacked version of the Bitsy engine, the game uses a simple art style, limited color palette, and basic controls to ensure accessibility.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Made in Bitsy:\u00a0https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy</p>\n<p>Utilizes some Bitsy hacks by\u00a0Sean LeBlanc (https://github.com/seleb)</p>\n<p>The game's design, additional code &amp; hacks, writing, &amp; art are\u00a0all by me.</p>\n<p>MUSIC:\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\"Ever Mindful\", \"Reawakening\", \"Super Friendly\"<br/>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>SOUND EFFECTS:</p>\n<p>\"Shepard Tone\", \"Dramatic Sting\"<br/>Alexander (www.orangefreesounds.com)<br/>Slight modifications were made to the originals.<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 &amp; CC BY-NC 4.0<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab7/ab7f1e5a9af1b844d27339ce5f5e7844.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alextomkow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
