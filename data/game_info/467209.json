Hopefully there are no issues.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game Description:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>The theme park is in chaos!</p>\n<p>A velociraptor has escaped containment and is out of our control!</p>\n<p>The more she eats, the faster she gets, making her more \"out of control\" the longer she stays alive!</p>\n<p>Good thing the police are on the scene, but... oh no! They are shooting civilians in the panic! The more out of control the velociraptor is, the more panicked and out of control the police get!</p>\n<p>And the velociraptor can eat the police, but if they shoot her first, they get \"Qualified Immunity\" and cannot be touched. That is because \"the system\", too, is out of control.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to add much more, especially in terms of varying the movement patterns of AI, adding more variations of cops with different weapons, as well as environmental hazards and more basic decorations...</p>\n<p>Not to mention the endless bits of polish like curving the spline while he's turning, or smoothing out some of the rough animations.</p>\n<p>Oh, and tiny little things like play testing, optimization, etc... My high score was embarrassingly low so for all I know the game becomes unplayable beyond a certain point... Fingers crossed that is not the case.<br/></p>\n<p>But, due to forces \"outside of my control\", I got started very late on this jam. And now, I may have 3 hours left on the clock, but not in my body. It is well past time to sleep.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Final development time:\u00a0 11 hours<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fc5d19ea93bbf1990a75ef8868ccfb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theTerrificJD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
