You can use the enclosed\r\nemulator to play the game but it should work on any MZ-80A emulator. To get the\r\nlatest version of the emulator please visit here:\r\nhttp://takeda-toshiya.my.coocan.jp/mz80k/index.html\r\nI have made a YouTube video showing how to launch the emulator and then load\r\nthe game, this can be found here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QNrL8D3Qz_s\r\nThe MZ-80A was marketed as a 'clean computer', meaning that there is no\r\nprogramming language already in memory when the computer is switched on.\r\nHowever, one of the tapes packaged with the machine was the SA-5510\r\nBASIC interpreter. Therefore this is the default BASIC provided with\r\nthe MZ-80A and is the one used for my game.\r\nGame Description\r\n----------------\r\nThe idea of the game is simple. You are placed inside a square game\r\narena and you are tasked with collecting as many 'Qubes' as possible before\r\nthe enemy Collector swipes them away from your grasp! You have exactly\r\none minute to collect as many as you can before the game ends.\r\nYou are free to move in any direction you like across the entire area\r\nof the arena. The enemy Collector exists on a fixed clockwise\r\ntrajectory around the edges of the square arena. However, they are allowed\r\nto move at twice your speed.\r\nTo control your player please use the numeric keypad:\r\n            UP\r\n            _\r\n           |8|\r\n            -\r\n     _      |      _\r\nLEFT|4|---- | ----|6|RIGHT\r\n     -      |      -\r\n            _\r\n           |2|\r\n            -\r\n           DOWN\r\nOne a minute has passed the game will end and return to the \"Ready.\" prompt.\r\nEnjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0a/d0ab69bb0970afa11de911822f97a97a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
