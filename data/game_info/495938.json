And a new weapon is ready, just put it in the player's hand and link to the player's script and it's ready to use.<br/><br/><br/>\u25baBullet Physics: bullet physics has 3 movement modes, one for physics, one for teleportation, and one calculated (recommended).<br/><br/><br/>\u25baVehicle Physics: vehicle physics has two types, car and motorcycle, easy adjustment in the inspector and with support for mesh collider correction.<br/>\n<br/><br/>\u25baRagdoll Physics: it is a system that manages the bones of Ragdoll, having a ragdoll done is just pressing the button to search for ragdoll bones and then the button to disable the physics of the bones. You can make calls from the disable and enable functions to use the way you prefer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\u25baDestructible Objects: It is a simple system that instantiates a fractured object when it collides with a bullet or an object at a high speed (you can adjust this by dragging a slider on the inspector).<br/><br/><br/>\u25baScene Scripts: the Asset Pack also has simple scripts that control the scenes, you can add a portal just by dropping the script on a trigger and writing the name of the scene.<br/>\n<br/><br/>\u25baMobile Inputs: The Asset Pack has Virtual Joystick, Touchfield, and Buttons, all easy to use scripts, just play in a UI component and you can access the data that these scripts provide as the touch distance to move a camera, and the coordinates joystick to move the player. The Asset Pack comes with prefab pre-configured canvas UI, ready to reskin.<br/><br/><br/>\u25baUtilities: the Asset Pack has useful scripts such as Auto Destroy, Shooting target movement (going from one side to the other), Resolution optimizer for mobile devices (but it can also be used as a resolution scale in a settings menu if you want) and etc.<br/>\n<br/><br/>\u25baAnimations: all animations are of the Humanoid type, so only characters with humanoid skeleton recognized by the Mecanim of Unity 3D can work.\r\n<em>(obs: some scripts are very long and have many variables so some of the images above are cut)</em>\r\n\u25baBuy the template on:\r\nCodester", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:21:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c0/6c00703da8d2072b9dfe01e802288fc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Julhiecio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
