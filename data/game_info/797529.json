So, about that, \"Fossils on site!\" is a game themed around Paleontology which was one of my 'brainstorm-ed' ideas after receiving the Jam's theme (which is \"Death is only the beginning!\").</p>\n<p>For the gameplay, i tried to simulate a board game, where the tiles compose your board and as a paleontologist out in the field, your goal is to find fossils without losing all your 'gold' (cooler than saying money), and also avoiding troubles related to your explorations! To achieve that you can use 3 different actions: Study(to obtain informations about\u00a0a surrouding tile), Move (your camp location to a adjacent tile) and Excavate.\u00a0It's a simple and straight forward game, and i hope you guys can enjoy it as i enjoyed producing it!</p>\n<p>Below there is a list of all the free assets that i used, once again, my most sincere thanks to them, and also to YOU for playing.</p>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>Asset name: Free Music Track for Games From: Rizwan Ashraf Available at Unity's Asset Store and from the owner's website\u00a0http://bravewarrior.co\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset name: Nature Sounds Pack - Free From: Goumain Antoine Available at Unity's Asset Store and from the owner's website\u00a0http://antoinegoumain.fr\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset name: Retro UI Sounds From: Alessandro Fam\u00e0 Available at Unity's Asset Store and from the owner's website\u00a0https://alessandrofama.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Asset name: Scribble Dungeons From: Kenney Available at creators website\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/scribble-dungeons</p>\n<p>Hope you have a wonderful day, hugs from Brazil.</p>\n<p>Mateus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T21:19:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4a66eb3d5c8081128ddf251ef38c4b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheGody"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
