There are no monsters, but you have to dodge traps and use keys to unlock doors! The dungeon will be different every time you play.

This could potentially lock the key you need to beat the dungeon behind the door you \"should\" have used that key on</li><li>Doors can pin you against the wall and make it impossible to move sometimes</li></ul>\r\nNot-so-Critical Things\r\n<ul><li>Sometimes you need to click to make the focus go to the right place</li><li>There's no UI sounds/footstep sounds</li><li>Pressure pads should give more feedback that you stepped on it</li><li>Dart trap darts can get stuck in open doorways</li><li>Bottomless pits are kind of bland</li><li>High scores aren't implemented (yet)</li><li>No options menu</li><li>Trigger options are very bland -- there should be more variety</li><li>Rooms should be of varying rarities</li><li>There should be a way to teleport back to the entrance of the dungeon</li><li>Multi-floor dungeon generation is broken and has been disabled</li><li>Lock icons should be replaced with unlocked locks once the player has opened the door they represent</li><li>Different locks should have different lock icon</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music by Michael Gall (Soundcloud)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8f2ef6cf4a44bb3eee240aec330689b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jay2645"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
