To make it worse, you are trapped in a pit. You have to eat your way up; by eating the shattered (unusable) platforms you can restore them in your tummy to later spit them repaired. Furthermore, whenever you eat a piece of platform you get the ability to use your super fart, which gives you a dash in any direction. The game starts at the bottom of the pit, and it ends when you get out of it.</p><p>Extract and Run \"Frog Knight\" to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T04:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858147afa7172849eb06c76d8672b3d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["moustan", "GUNDICK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
