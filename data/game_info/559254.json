Let's see\u2026\r\nThe Code\r\nJust 10 lines in Sinclair BASIC are quite challenging because this dialect lacks of ELSE command,\r\nso using IF is very restricted (one per line as much), and you have to use many logical\r\nfunctions, that make the code to be much slower.\r\nLine 1: Sets the variables and the UDG, and prints the scoreboard for a new run.\r\nLine 2: Sets the scoreboard for a new stage, and creates a random stage putting 1 potion, 3\r\nkeys and 10 doors. Maybe the potion and keys can be overlapped by walls and doors, so they\r\nwill be erased.\r\nLine 3: Sets the variables for starting the stage, and puts the 20 ghosts into the dungeon.\r\nLine 4: Ghosts' algorithm. Their coordinates are stored in a (20,3) matrix, first 2 elements are\r\ny,x and the 3rd element means 1 if the ghost exists, or 0 if it does not exist (because he collided\r\nwith the Elf). In this line the ghost moves towards Elf, comparing y,x coordinates of both, and\r\nchecks if the ghost has touched Elf. Variables f and c set is the number of the ghost to be\r\nmoved in each loop. Variable l is +1 for going left, -1 for right. Variable v is +1 for down, and -1\r\nfor up.\r\nLine 5: Elf's algorithm, checking pressed keys, and checking if a door was touched, opening it if\r\nElf has a key. Variable p is +1 for going left, -1 for right. Variable o is +1 for down, and -1 for up.\r\nLine 6: Potion release. It checks if the potion key was pressed, in which case makes all ghosts\r\ndisappear, setting their new coordinates to the bottom left side of the dungeon.\r\nLine 7: Erasing and printing the Elf in the new position, and checking if he is still alive (health\r\nabove 0, this is variable z)\r\nLine 8: Checking ghosts contact. Variable w is the attribute of the new position of Elf, if it\r\nmatches Ghost color (white ink with bright, this is, ATTR=71) this means that Elf has touched a\r\nghost, losing 50 units of health. If health is lower than 1, game over message appears and a\r\nnew run starts.\r\nLine 9: Checking exit. Idem, if w value is 7 (white ink, no bright) this means that Elf has reached\r\nthe exit pit, going to line 2 to create the new stage.\r\nLine 10: Collecting key or potion. Attribute for key is 6 (yellow ink, no bright), and for potion is\r\n1 (blue ink, no bright). Logical functions are used to increase k (keys) or q (potions) depending\r\non w. It prints the number of keys and potions, and makes the loop to line 4.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:13:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/596/596f1b135e798a9eefa47cbcb243e44c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
