Toggling fullscreen after loading will break the controls.</p><p>A short, dodge-the-asteroids type space race where you make your way towards an anomaly that is attracting a planet-killing corruption, while avoiding getting caught in the corruption yourself.</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or ARROW KEYS\u00a0to move, ESC to pause, SPACE to advance dialogue. You can land on a planet to fully replenish your fuel.</p>\n<p>Made in collaboration with\u00a0Obnivelint for Godot Wild Jam #46, to fit the\u00a0theme \"orb.\" Also, this is our very first full game! There are so many things we want to add/fix/do but weren't able to within the time constraints of the jam. We may end up releasing a more polished version in the future!</p>\n<p>Known bugs: Settings page not implemented, vertical level looping is not quite seamless so sometimes planets will just appear/disappear out of nowhere, if you restart you have to hit ESC again before you can move. Sorry :/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T13:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/342/3422105a661992f26b16b5ccaa92eec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ezbeths"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
