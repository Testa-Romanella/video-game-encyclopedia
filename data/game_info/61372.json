Will it be a Chinese leader, or will some external force interfere in consolidation of the territory?<br/>In this historical grand strategy, you can choose any of playable ancient countries of East Asia and lead it to the total hegemony. Your goal is to conquer fertile plains, boundless steppes, impassable mountains and create an empire that the world hasn\u2019t ever seen!Features:<ul><li>More than 30 playable countries - from the Chinese kingdoms and ending with not so well known ancient tribes from Manchuria, Tibet and the Philippines;<br/></li><li>Detailed map with nearly 150 provinces;<br/></li><li>Different types of troops from various civilizations represented in the game;<br/></li><li>Historical background with a large number of diverse religions and cultures.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a9/9a9e6d863bf621bfc1674ed98bbf178e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Coffee-Powered Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Coffee-Powered Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
