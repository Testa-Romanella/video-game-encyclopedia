I released it\u00a0 to gather some feedback about the level design and controls, after all it's my first game that isn't an endless runner with random generated obstacles.</p>\n<p>The demo contains 3 levels (without bosses and music. I need\u00a0help with those).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I also added a DMG GB filter to the fans of the original Game Boy.</p>\n<p>It's 100% free.
