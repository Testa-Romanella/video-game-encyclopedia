You are part of the few that have survived and now you must fight for your life against other survivors and the indigenous zombie population. Survive solely by yourself, or put your trust into other survivors to survive in this changed world.<strong>This is your story.</strong><br/>Perfect Dead is a open-world survival online multiplayer game, in which players follow a similar goal: to survive as long as they can. Players can experience chilling encounters and tension evolving from the game play. There is no tips, or help given to players. They must survive by instinct. Every decision you make matters, the smallest mistake can be lethal. If you perish, you lose everything and must scavenge once more with only your hands.
