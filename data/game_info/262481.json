{"id": 262481, "slug": "eternal-realm-ii-dark-matter", "name": "Eternal Realm II: Dark Matter", "name_original": "Eternal Realm II: Dark Matter", "description": "The Eternal Realm was created a millenium ago by the king Zerberus. It is a world filled with Dark Matter, a substance that grants immortality and the ability to create virtual worlds. However, living in such a dark world can make one insane. The king and his creations have lived in this peaceful yet, disturbing world for ages but, those times are about to come to an end. The \"Realm Breaker\" is about to shatter everyone's perspective of what \"reality\" really is. Archimedes, a member of the \"Royal Seed\" has embarked on creating a new world with characters using life-like A.I. The player characters he created are now the rulers of this world, but, in name only. Almost as soon as Archimedes gives them the kingdom, a strange abyss phenomena starts appearing all over the land. The ten heroes set out to save their world against this new threat. Meanwhile, in the Eternal Realm, Archimedes' project is sabotaged and now he and his friends are branded as traitors. Who is this unknown enemy lurking in the shadows? Why is he framing Archimedes? This game is part II of the \"Royal War Saga\". <br/>\n<br/>\r\nImportant Characters: <br/>\r\nWarrior: Arrogant and self-proclaimed king of the realm <br/>\r\nBerserker: Stupid, naive, and friendly.

The actions can be divided up between the characters as you see fit as long as they have the stamina to carry out the action. Characters recover 30-40% of their stamina per turn and the \"Rest\" command allows an extra 40% to be recovered. It's the same battle system from Eternal Realm but, now with more options, diversity of abilities, and a more balanced difficulty level. Now you can switch characters out during battles and change accessories to fit the situation. If you like a good rpg that actually makes you think during battles and isn't just \"mash x to continue\" then this game is for you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGame controls: <br/>\r\nZ: Confirm / talk / open treasure chest <br/>\r\nX: Cancel / open menu <br/>\r\nQ and W: Scroll through character menus <br/>\r\nLeft and right arrow keys (during battle): Switch characters <br/>\r\nAlt + Enter: Change to Full-screen", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78e/78e611acef63213e6dc1f5ba66bb260a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 289, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omega Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Omega Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
