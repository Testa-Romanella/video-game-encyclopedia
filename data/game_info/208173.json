It is called Pugnatum Arenam because that is Latin for fighting arena. The aim of this game is to get as far through the dungeons as you possibly can by buying new weapons and abilities. So far prototypes are released for windows but I hope to port it to ios, android and mac.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6e5f0a2ebd73fdacb932807d996469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
