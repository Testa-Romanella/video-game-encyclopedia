{"id": 802356, "slug": "dino-jumper-saginbek_i", "name": "Dino jumper (saginbek_i)", "name_original": "Dino jumper (saginbek_i)", "description": "<p>A 2D platformer game about a dinosaur that runs, jumps and swims to collect coins while avoiding numerous hazards including spikes, lasers, hot steam pipes, sea urchins and many more. The main mechanic of the game are the 4 types of equipment - special costumes that protect the player from different types of hazards.\u00a0The game was written in Python, but it was converted to an exe so you don't need Python to run it. The source code is included but it's kinda messy, to be honest. It's my first platformer game and my first upload on the website, so any feedback would be appreciated. Controls are simple: w, a, s, d or arrow keys - move, 'r' - return to previous checkpoint, 'b', 'h', 't' and 'u' - change costume.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T12:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac7/ac79c3c6684106ddb8cbd37a98221eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saginbek_i"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
