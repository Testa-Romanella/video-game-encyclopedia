Because of course the rich have no interest in giving out a currency that has value outside of being something they can control the value/supply of themselves.</p>\n<p>There is a large amount of items in the game, of limited usefulness. Some small solace is that even your foes will have bought into this system.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Developed as part of the Briefs series, a gold extra project with additional support by Strange Scaffold.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:53:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d66a12207d4bb8e64ba5b172a486397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
