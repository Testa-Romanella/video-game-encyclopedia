It is a singleplayer game that test your skills in calculating wind and gravity effect plus your sense when to activate which ordnance type. Game is split in two types of battlefields, air and ground combat, in both you fight the british forces as you simulate the Battle of Britain. Every game starts with air combat portion which ends when the timer reaches \"END\" - then you move on to ground combat.</p>\n<p><strong>READ THE CONTROLS BEFORE GAMEPLAY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE LOST</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Any time you wish you can ESC and read them again.</strong></p>\n<p>Be very aware that you must manually set the fuse delay for your shell. Using (keyboard num3, num4, num5) you can switch between 3,4 or 5 seconds delay and that way you determine after how many seconds it will explode in air. Very useful if countering bad wind conditions - it is all explained in controls as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>***Features***\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>AIR COMBAT</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Fight off waves of enemy aircraft while at the same time protecting your bombers heading home.
