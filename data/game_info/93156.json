The barrow wights have taken up residence in the ruins of their former keeps and unleashed legions of undead to wreck havoc upon the lands. The denizens of the land have also become emboldened by the growing shadow of evil and despair. In desperation, the Lord Deciper has issued forth a calling for heroes to come to the aid of the people, and to find a way to thrust back the growing darkness and return the barrow wights to their slumber.   <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Lurking I: Immortui</strong> boasts a huge open world role-playing experience with massive exploration, hundreds of NPCs to converse with, hordes of bloodthirsty foes, dozens of secrets, puzzles, and piles of weapons, armor, special items (and other loot). Develop your characters by chasing the skills you desire for them as they gain <br/>experience and level up. Play magical bard songs, cast magical spells,\u00a0 and unravel the mystery of the resurrected barrow wights. No one will guide you through each step. No one will come to your aid in the wild. Accept a challenge that many modern games do not offer and see if you have the wits and perseverance to role-play in the old school style. If you long for the depth of story and challenging quests of the golden era of computer role playing games, Lurking I is for you.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>[version info] - view ReadMe.txt in download package for more info.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>v3.0:</strong> Why not. New tile set, LARGER display, and some other cosmetic changes. Largely untested for bugs that may have been introduced in the process. In particular, the stairs from original tile set where kind of visually ambiguous as to if they went up or down. The new stair tiles are not... so I suspect some stairs will indicate the wrong direction (i.e. a down-looking stair takes you up). I will be working on this.</p>\n<p><strong>v3.1:</strong> Completed the process of verifying every single stairway in the game and ensuring that they represent the proper direction under the new tile set. All ready to go! Journey onward.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>***PLEASE****</strong> If you have played this game, take a few minutes to rate it on the site, leave feedback, and post your experience to your friends and colleagues.
