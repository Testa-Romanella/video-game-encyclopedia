Beautifully presented and thoughtfully designed, the game became an instant classic thanks to its measured balance of strategic planning and psychotic blasting. Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated content in a computer game, <em>Hunter's Moon </em>pushed the boundaries of the genre and helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Hunter\u2019s Moon Remastered </em>is a fully remastered, overhauled, and updated version of the seminal C64 shoot \u2018em up. The game has been remastered for C64 cartridge and boasts a host of amazing new features including over 50 new levels, 5 new star systems, new level types, new music, new playing modes, stunning intro and outro sequences, built-in level editor, and enhanced presentation including foreign language support.</p>\n\n\n<p>After flying your trusty ship <em>Hunter </em>too close to a black hole, you find yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling, hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien <strong>Starcells </strong>\u2013 these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course back home.<br/></p>\n<p>The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a task made more challenging by the invincible <strong>Worker </strong>cells which patrol the cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted by using your ship's trusty <strong>Perma-Shields</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the <strong>Bonus Game </strong>where you can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.</p>\n<p>As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of diverse and challenging hive types, including <strong>Attackers </strong>that throw out deadly spores, <strong>Darkcells </strong>which are only visible on radar, <strong>Switchers </strong>that change direction without warning, <strong>Jumpgates </strong>which jump to random locations, and <strong>Blackouts </strong>which plunge the hives into darkness.</p>\n<p>Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to find your way home to <em>Hunter's Moon</em>...?</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Over <strong>180 </strong>levels spread across <strong>21 </strong>Star Systems\r\n  </li><li>New level types including <strong>Jumpgates </strong>and <strong>Blackouts</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Trainer Version</strong> designed for novice players\r\n  </li><li>All-new <strong>Random Mode</strong> to test seasoned veterans\r\n  </li><li>Save your game progress <strong>direct to the cartridge</strong>\n</li><li>Stunning new <strong>intro </strong>and <strong>outro </strong>sequences\r\n  </li><li><strong>New in-game music</strong> and <strong>enhanced parallax starfield</strong>\n</li><li>Built-in <strong>Level Editor</strong> to craft your own cunning creations\r\n  </li><li><strong>Multi-language support</strong> for French, German, Italian, and Spanish\r\n  </li><li><strong>Bonus: </strong>Original 1987 version also included on the cartridge!</li><li>Full\u00a0<strong>PAL\u00a0</strong>&amp;\u00a0<strong>NTSC\u00a0</strong>compatibility (Remastered Version only)</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><em>\"One of the most original and imaginative<br/>shoot 'em ups ever released for the 64.\"<br/></em><em><strong>Commodore Format</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>\"I'm always a sucker for shoot 'em ups, especially when they're<br/>as good-looking, innovative and as challenging as this.\"</em><br/><em><strong>Zzap!64</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"It's a blaster without equal: a beautifully-crafted<br/>combination of puzzle game and pulsating action.\"</em><br/><em><strong>Gordon Houghton, Lemon64</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>\"Head and shoulders above the masses<br/></em><em>of shoot-'em-ups currently on the market.\"<br/></em><strong><em>The Games Machine</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>MARTIN WALKER<br/></strong>Design, code, graphics, and SFX</p>\n<p><strong>MATT GRAY<br/></strong>Game soundtrack</p>\n<p><strong>DAN HOTOP<br/></strong>Remastering and additional code</p>\n<p><strong>ROBIN LEVY &amp;\u00a0</strong><strong>MARTIN PIPER<br/></strong>Cinematic sequences</p>\n<p><strong>STE DAY<br/></strong>Additional graphics</p>\n<p><strong>ANDY ROBERTS<br/></strong>Production &amp; inspirational input</p>\n\n<p><strong>OLIVER FREY<br/></strong>Cover artwork and illustrations</p>\n\n\n<p>The downloadable C64 digital version is designed for use with a C64 emulator \u2013 it <em>cannot </em>be used with an <strong>EasyFlash </strong>cartridge, <strong>1541 Ultimate</strong>, or <strong>Turbo Chameleon</strong>.

Both versions include a simple .BAT file to make running the game much simpler. Please be sure to consult the README file for more information.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>The cartridge version of <em>Hunter's Moon</em> Remastered will be available in late 2018\u00a0exclusively from Protovision.
