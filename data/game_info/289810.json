He cannot leave his home in the foggy forest because, when he travels too far, the world loses all color, shape and meaning. How will he ever find a wolf pack to call his own? Players find mushrooms and other items to plant on their houses, to grow bigger houses - and to help Oddy advance towards his dream of getting wolves to come to him.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls: ASDW / Arrows, Z, Space<br/></p>\n<p>Controller Controls: Left Stick, A, B</p>\n\n<p>Created by Yori Kvitchko, Dustin Maertz, Michael Middleton for Global Game Jam 2019</p>\n<p>Narrator: Michael Middleton</p>\n<p>Theme music: 'Piano Fairy Tale' provided by Austin Timmerman/Pond5.com</p>\n<p>Game sounds: Provided by Pond5.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:13:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32b1951327bd7b80c94b5691d9494782.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeedBolt Studios", "YoriKv"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
