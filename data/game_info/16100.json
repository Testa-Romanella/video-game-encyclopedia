Would you dare to play it?Game rules<br/><strong>Emitters</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>These points of color, emitting a beam of the same color. These can move only along the edge of the screen.<br/><br/><strong>Receivers</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Receivers pick up the emitter's color and become this color. The receiver is surrounded by a ring of rainbow, which becomes the same color as the center circle when it's right.<br/><br/><strong>Combining colors</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Receivers can be combined in various colors, and also throw a beam to pass their color to another receiver.<br/><br/><strong>Target</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>All receivers need a particular color, and only until each has its right color, level is completed.<br/><br/><strong>Obstacles</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Obstacles are white rectangular elements, no beam can pass through them.<br/><br/><strong>Prisms</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>Prisms are triangles that divide a combined color, only work if the combined color comes directly from the receiver where they were combined. These prisms have two triangles in sides that indicate where they throw the rays.<br/><br/><strong>Pipelines</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>On stage there are pipes invisible, these divert the beam in a different direction already specified, these become visible when a ray touches them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a8/4a8aa5ce11dfc207860aed4ad68e30ac.jpg", "website": "http://studio.otakumaker.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 61}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sliverbroom Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OtakuMaker.com"], "esrb_rating": null}
