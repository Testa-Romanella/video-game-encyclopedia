It is my first jam game, and the first game I've done to such a small time limit. I'm very proud of the result.</p><p><strong>It came 27th overall, out of 367 entries!</strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2021</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There are 20 stages in the game, ending in a boss fight. It was made in just 2 days.<br/></p>\n<p>All art in this game is by Kenny, as the jam requires. Kenny's art is incredibly numerous AND public domain, so it is a holy grail for game developers.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:\u00a0</strong>Use the arrow keys or WASD to rotate the world. Collect all the coins in the level to advance, and make sure you avoid the obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>This game is copyright Jack Robotham 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/463ba730b662ab406bc3b36fe23045da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jack Robotham"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
