This strange realm contains the golden audio jack that will open the portal to the next realm, so the player can defeat the evil Dr. Boom. In the game's current state, it shows one level. Movement keys used, aside from arrow keys, are the W, S, D, A keys. Spacebar provides a jump, which can be used multiple times as long as there is stamina. To spawn the key, the player must destroy one of the enemies.</p><p>Jam Site: LSU Global Game JamJam Year: 2017Platforms: MS WindowsTools And Technologies: Unity (any product)Technology Notes: Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Sketchbook, Blender, Medibang Paint Pro, Rhino, Studio One, Visual StudioCredits: </p><p>Hameed Abdul, Shaikha Al-Mashaykhi, Sui Chen, Trevon Cooper, Jonathan L Delaney, Kyle Eastin, Afsaneh Ghazavi, Jun Lin, Chase Mitchusson, Tarlan Mokhtarzadeh, Holly Moore, Sahar Rahimi, Robin Tallitsch, Jonathan Wingerter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724f5f05294a1dad59ff156943eda65d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hameed Abdul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
