When you lean to the left, your character dodges to the left and when you lean to the right, your character dodges to the right. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possibly by dodging eggs being thrown at your character's face.</p>\n<p>If you're too lazy making the controller, you can try it out by swiping left or right on a mousepad but its NOT THE SAME.</p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T06:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5cda9d9829ff64d00e116ad6062e01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kjell H\u00e5ft\u00e9n"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
