Our goal is to allow players to get completely different experience during new game+ and new game++. Even the same time point of the same route will be a little different with the game proceeding. The first playthrough will take 5-6 hours, and the second playthough(NG+) will take 10 hours or more. The whole game playthrough will take more than 20 hours.<br/>There will be a huge number of side quests as supplement of the main story. We need more content to deliver our fantasy world view to each player. (Note: Side quests, collection elements and challenge elements will also change as the game proceeds.)<br/><br/><strong>Performance</strong><br/>The amount of scenario text in demo is about 100,000 Chinese words. It will reach 600,000 to 800,000 when finished to ensure a more complete expression of the world view. (We are sorry that we are temporarily unable to count the words in demo of English version because we haven\u2019t finished it yet.) <br/>We try to design multiple puzzles and multiple solutions in a same map for players who explore in NG+. When using some special methods to solve the puzzles, players can be surprised to find: How can the solution be so? There is still a thing hidden here? This is completely different from the last time I playthrough! We think explore and discover are two biggest pleasure of the puzzle game.<br/>However, players do not need to worry about the difficulty of the game. Puzzles in main story will be relatively easy to solve. So players can enjoy main story without too much pressure. For core puzzle game player, we prepare a large number of side quests and challenge puzzles. Side quests and hidden content can be discovered by some evidence. They will unlock some special achievements. The feeling of complete the challenge which seemed to have no solution must be cool!<br/><br/><strong>Characters</strong><br/><br/>Sandra<br/>The granddaughter of a blacksmith in a small Village.
