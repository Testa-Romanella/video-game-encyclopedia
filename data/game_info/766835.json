I'm Mafuu and entirely new to this world. I started using &amp; learning on Unity &amp; C# a week ago and decided to try the <strong>Ludum Dare 50 Game Jam</strong> !</p>\n<p>For the Lundum Dare 50 Game Jam challenge, my team and I couldn't finish our project &amp; decided to postpone it for the Extra option LD offers or simply finish it together without a time limit later on when we have more free time (no school or work).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>BUT-</strong> I really wanted to challenge myself still ! So I made something on my own in the 9 hours left I had for the 72 hours Game Jam ! It was VERY difficult, and I started Unity &amp; C# only last week, but it was really cool still and I can't wait to do more. I learned a lot !</p>\n<p>So this game maze by was made in 7-8 hours on Unity &amp; C# for the Ludum Dare 50 - and includes the following which I learned at the same time :</p>\n<p>\u2022 Player movements, Triggers &amp; Colliders<br/>\u2022 Pathfinding for AI (at least the basics)<br/>\u2022 UI (basics)</p>\n<p>I used Brackeys' tutorials a lot but not only. It was both fun and frustrating at times, because I'm new and made so many repetitive mistakes in the beginning with both my team &amp; then on my own for this project.</p>\n<p>This is just the start of a long journey for me, as I wish to become a Technical Artist !</p>\n<p>Check out my linktree here if you wish to follow me on my socials : https://linktr.ee/makazemafuu<br/>I'm still working on a lot of different projects, including my portfolio that'll slowly have more things inside in the futur.</p>\n<p>--<br/></p>\n<p>I had tried to put a timer, which was working except for the part where the player dies and it wouldn't stop, and I couldn't find how to do that before it was too late unfortunately. Any ideas how I could make my timer stop when my GAME OVER display shows ?</p>\n<p><strong>Feel free to give me some constructive feedback &amp; tips on how to improve this type of maze game with enemy following you, triggers and such. \u2661</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T19:36:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c590cbfe512c87a8889dd48b120891c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["makazemafuu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
