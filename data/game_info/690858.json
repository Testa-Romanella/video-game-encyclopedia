{"id": 690858, "slug": "danceball", "name": "danceball", "name_original": "danceball", "description": "<p><strong>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!\u00a0</strong>This is\u00a0Danceball, a game where you move a triangle by\u00a0pressing buttons on the beat and firing a bouncing color ball that\u00a0breaks colored bricks, absorbing that color to be used to unlock\u00a0dashed-line barriers of the same color so that you can get to the star\u00a0and survive the song! There are five demo songs, press Control-R to\u00a0randomly choose colors and a song. It is a work in progress and many\u00a0things are not implemented yet. In the near future\u00a0I\u00a0will be working with a music licensing company to get lots more music into the game.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Edit \"danceball/config.lisp\" to set up USB gamepad/dancepad.\u00a0 I will have a proper setup screen soon.\u00a0Or use\u00a0<strong>arrows + shift key</strong>. For shields, press together up+down or left+right.</p>\n<p>The little black and white sparkly asterisk that hovers around your\u00a0character, indicates the direction of the star.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For gamepads that can't register up/down or left/right simultaneously\u00a0like a dance pad, assign the left and right bumpers in config.lisp.</p>\n<p>Some gamepads have a software \"D-pad\" mode that may make the game moreplayable. Try consulting your manufacturer's gamepad instruction\u00a0manual.</p>\n<p>Please email deeteeoh1138@gmail.com with questions/bugs/issues/ideas!</p>\n<p>Or say hi to me as \"dto\" on Libera.chat#lispgames IRC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T04:14:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fda/fda9e7805b8e45e2f65caa6c0cee7266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["dto"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
