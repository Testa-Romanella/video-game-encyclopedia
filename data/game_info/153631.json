The idea is that you are a robot diplomat sent to prevent war between humans and a cat-like alien race. My role in this project was to create the user interface and the text-parsing system. I stopped working on Diplomat in spring of 2015, due to my role being finished and future projects that I wanted to begin (mainly Row Runner). Diplomat is either completely finished or still in development. The most recent build can be found below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RoachDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
