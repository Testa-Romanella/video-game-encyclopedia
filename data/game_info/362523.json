I took it seriously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to park your speeding cars into tiny spaces in an Aldi car park\u00a0all the while being heckled by Danny Dyer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made more as a coding challenge. Hence so\u00a0I'm taking no donations or payments for it. It's also pretty much based on the design of No Break Valet so please please go and buy that game as it's crazy fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T03:46:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d326270fc6f4e62c056a94dcb6a65f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Turtle Roll Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
