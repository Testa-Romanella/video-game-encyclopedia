Buckle-up and take control of your space pod as you rocket through high stakes obstacle courses spanning multiple alien star systems. Test your reflexes, improve your skill, and become a master pilot where speed is your play-thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You\u2019re going to crash, so you might as well crash in an adrenaline fueled blaze of glory. Impact space stations at high-speed, wreck booster rockets, destroy communication satellites, and punch-through solar panels. Experience brilliant zero-g physics based explosions as you tear through space stations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Campaign missions start easy and increase in difficulty as you learn to pilot your space pod. With each successful landing you\u2019ll progress to a new mission with increased difficulty. Master all four campaign missions and you\u2019ll unlock the endless runner mode.<br/><br/>Test your skill and harness your twitch reflexes in endless mode as your space pod accelerates to breakneck speeds. Test your reflexes, improve your skill, and become a master pilot where speed is your play-thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each play-through is unique with randomized procedurally generated courses. Space stations will change their configuration, rotation, and location so running the gauntlet is no walk in the park. You\u2019ll need to be alert and on your toes to avoid destruction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Experience alien planets from orbit as you progress through each campaign mission. Marvel at the lava fields on the volcanic world of Kepler 10B. Fly through the ice rings of a frozen world. Travel to the mysterious Tau Ceti star system and experience the awe of a huge gas giant in the 51 Pegasi system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1580380", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T12:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de2/de2285991f578d40f626c87bd895e191.jpg", "website": "https://www.descentvector.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Heavy Pepper"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Heavy Pepper"], "esrb_rating": null}
