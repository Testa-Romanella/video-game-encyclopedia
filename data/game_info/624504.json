A challenge of speed, dexterity, and willpower. Not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>A colourful gang has been causing turmoil in a town. The local sheriff has issued bounties for prominent members, but nobody dares to confront the goons because of their famous gunslinging capabilities. Nobody, but you.<br/><br/>Take down Red Rudy, Green Grover and the other bandits as you slay them in the one type of match that counts, and free the people from their plague.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Tri-Jam #125 and was made in approximately 3 hours (under 3:15 at least). The theme was \"only one enemy\", interpreted as fighting with one enemy.<br/></p>\n<p>Many thanks to Eeve Somepx for the font, Joel Steudler for the music and Sidearm Studios for the sound effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Use the mouse to focus on your opponent. Keep focussing for a short burst of slow-motion when the guns are drawn and a better aim. Use WASD or the arrow keys to move your hand. Make sure your hand stays on your revolver to minimize the time it takes to draw it.</p>\n<p><strong>Problems &amp; Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Please leave any problems you encounter (or any different type of feedback) in the comments, that would be greatly appreciated. :)<br/><br/>I hope you have fun! And thank you for taking a look.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:19:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893b952b6760ca8e4fce3377c685c960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperSjoerdie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
