I demonstrate 3 simple battles complete with damage, leveling up, status effects, battle animations, and loot! Based on popular turn-based RPG's like Final Fantasy, SaGa and Pokemon for the Game Boy, I hope my battle system will inspire you in your quest to make an awesome Game Boy RPG!\u00a0</p>\n<p>V0.1 - I wanted to put this out there for a while, but never found the time. It's chopped directly out of my work-in-progress game PageTurner so it's a little rough around the edges, but it'll be a complete demonstration when I'm finished. Thanks for dropping by to check it out! Goblin is a stronger clone of Earthworm and \"All\" square is disabled atm. Both to be prepared in the next update.</p>\n<p>For GB Studio 2.0 Beta. Battle backgrounds, Slime enemy, Menu Cursor and Poison Icon created by me. Goblin and Earthworm modified from an asset pack by LuckyCassette which you can find here. All other assets are default assets included in GB Studio. Download or purchase of this does not include ownership of any assets not CREATED by me, meaning my mods of LuckyCassette's sprites are off-limits for commercial use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e839ee87a38dfedad641ddcdd5431f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FerretHallGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
