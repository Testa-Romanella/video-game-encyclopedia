I decided to make the mini game for fun so people can try it.  I see many comments on those Facebook ads about how they would play the game if it was like the ad so now here's your chance.  Spoiler alert, it gets really boring after about 20 minutes, but at least now you know.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBest of luck adventurers!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T06:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0e/c0e412da159e41b0128b7f0f5a47e37f.jpg", "website": "https://decktronic.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeckTronic"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DeckTronic"], "esrb_rating": null}
