SDS had a monopoly of the world, controlling all aspects of life. However, as with many big bad evil companies, this one destroyed the world, leaving nothing in it's wake. This is where Gary comes in. Water levels slowly dwindling, the Earth was starting to shatter into pieces. Gary had to develop the glue to hold it together. This super glue took everything Earth had to offer, but everyone was safe. Sadly, not everyone was happy. There a was a gang of tortoises who liked to build model airplanes, tanks, and cars of the like. But, with all the glue taken, their life's work was brought to a halt. They started attacking the Super Glue, harvesting it for their own malicious needs, unbeknownst to them the damage they were causing. It is up to Gary the glue engineer to piece together scrap parts and defend the Super Glue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da148c0e7d1304d4f13a5ff66702188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["johnCavatelli"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
