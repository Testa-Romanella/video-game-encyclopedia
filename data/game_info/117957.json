Soundwave physics are different, objectives are different but in the end, the concept's almost the same.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>LISTEN. EXPLORE. ESCAPE.</em></p>\n<p><strong>EXPLORE</strong> </p>\n<p>The game features 299 (not including Level 0 - \"The Lobby\") levels. Can you explore and get out safely through all the levels?</p>\n<p>There are multiple doors in every level that leads to other levels. But don't get your hopes up when you see one; some doors are locked, and might trap you in a dead end.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to explore and get out of as many levels as you can safely, with your current level and progress displayed everytime you die or pass through a door.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>LISTEN</strong></p>\n<p>One thing's for sure - you can't even see yourself in the dark, but somehow you can see soundwaves clearly like they are made of solids. </p>\n<p>It's you decision. To pace around with danger hanging around every corner, or silently bump around the dungeon blindly?</p>\n\n<p><strong>ESCAPE</strong></p>\n<p>Monsters. They are everywhere, lurking in darkness, waiting for a slight noise to indicate the intruder's whereabouts.</p>\n<p>You can hide from them and sneak past, but not for long... they will get impatient. They will howl. They will 'see' you, just like how you 'see' them. </p>\n<p>You know what you must do... run.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse click to switch between sneaking and running - sneaking is very slow but you cannot see where you are. Running is relatively fast but you are easily spotted and you cannot outrun the beasts.</p>\n<p>ESC to save and quit the game.</p>\n<p>R (capitals - use capslock or SHIFT together) to quit the game and clear your save. Proper button to be added.</p>\n<p><strong>TODO + CHANGELOG</strong></p>\n<p>Please help by reporting any bugs you find or any ideas you have in the comments!</p>\n<p>0.3 [TODO + FUTURE CHANGELOG] Coming ?/11/2015</p>\n<p>- SFX</p>\n<p>- Rework enemy spawns to prevent them from being stuck in walls, and also to add more challenging spawns</p>\n<p> - Keys: unique item to warp a locked door into a specific level.
