Once again great work by Daniel Fessler, Noah Duncan, Danny Rogers and the team for the retro remake competition 2006.</p>\n<p>'Our version of dig dug gives reason to the original<br/>In ours - it takes place right after a UFO crash landing.<br/>You, the hazmat, have to go in there and kill all of the<br/>alien creatures. We added alot of features to our game<br/>that the original couldn't dream of - things like particle<br/>effects, screen shakes, and multi-tile objects. We also<br/>added obsticles to get in your way and improved the AI<br/>of the enemy by using A* path finding. Our game has 5 worlds<br/>with 3 levels in each world.</p>\n<p>we also included a level editor - its not user friendly, but<br/>its not hard to get used to.'</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9eded95275d7701788bc918ee3ae7fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Retroreloader @ Return learn games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
