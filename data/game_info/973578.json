I'm Shadowblue.<br/>This is my first solely-developed game on steam. <br/>Actually it's from a prototype idea I was testing for exploring a new way to design diversiform boss fights in 2D games efficiently. <br/>After playing a lot of 2D games that require dodging skills(Like Touhou, Archero, POE, etc.)<br/>I'm really weary of those repetitive monotonous boss stages. Challenge the same thing again and again is just not that fun over time.<br/>So maybe it's a good idea to try adding more variations to boss battles, while somehow still keep everything balanced.<br/>That's why I developed this game. I'll be glad if you like this idea too.<br/><br/>I'll continuously improve it and add more content. More unique bullet patterns, more fun.<br/>And occasionally raise the selling price based on that:)<h3>Key Features</h3>Only boss fights, and lots of them<br/>Numerous possible combos of boss and addons so even the same boss feels very different every time<br/>Very simple control, just move that red dot to try dodging everything in a trial. No need to press other keys during the heat of battle<br/>Infinite difficulty scaling, your limit will be tested", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-15T04:10:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c73/c7363a197c1837f2f49166d54c34ac96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadowblue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Shadowblue"], "esrb_rating": null}
