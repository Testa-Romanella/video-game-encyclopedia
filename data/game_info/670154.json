It was created in under a week including most of the engine. It is intended to be\u00a0 a prototype for a potential future rpg using the rules of the jam. The prototype is a very rough version with some incomplete features and and not so great collisions. I will consider making a full game once I have made more progress on other projects.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls:</p>\n<p>Z - A</p>\n<p>X - B</p>\n<p>Space - Select</p>\n<p>Enter - Start</p>\n<p>D-pad - Arrow Keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T06:01:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e97d37ee452cf45c2c10737daa5c4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emanosaurus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
