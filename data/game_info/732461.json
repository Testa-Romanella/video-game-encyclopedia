It&amp;#39;s hard to tell if it&amp;#39;s a genuine masterpiece or a mediocre failure, but it&amp;#39;s worth giving a shot, especially considering the mere 80 Microsoft Points it&amp;#39;ll cost you. A DX version was released a few months later for the iOS, and so was a so-called DX Championship Edition in early 2012 for the PC. They both feature additional content, like extra characters facesets and achievements.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the PC port of Four Winds Fantasy, which was available temporarily on an official site as a pay-what-you-want release that isn&#39;t available anymore. It&#39;s mostly the same as the iOS and the original Xbox 360 versions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-01T22:47:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3ba3c896e6b43c81ad4c90cedc8cea39.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/fwfdx", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
