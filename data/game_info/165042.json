I made this game for the GMTK Jam where you have 48 hours to make a game completely from nothing. And as the rule says,I must describe how my game fits the theme:</p>\n<p>In the theme video Mark talks about multitasking, and making things do multiple tasks. That's why I made this game. With breathing in the center of events, everything is connected. Moving, attacking, beeing attacked all that makes you lose your breath. To recover it, you simply must stay calm or hold 'q' to take a deep breath. Mark was also talking about things getting harder when you level up, soo I made certain monsters only show at higher levels. The spawnrate and the maximal number of monsters and flowers (boosts) are also depending on the level you are on\u00a0 witch level you are on. But wait, Mark also talked about the player being able to make difficult decisions. That's why, when you level up, you get two random boosts witch can give you permenant or one time goods. With all those various things implemented, my game testers found the game interesting and quite frequently addictive.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are some things I will point out. I am a 16 years old teenager and I'm from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina soo my English grammar could have some mistakes,soo please don't mind them. Also this is my first game jam soo if I made some things wrong please tell me soo I can now in the future to not do that again.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits and suff I used:</strong></p>\n<p>Buttons and icon are made by : Andrew-David Jahchan \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Fixed few scripts of mine: Jevin \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Game tested: Sedad Tinjak, Adi Kova\u010d, Soul, Ermin Kova\u010d</p>\n<p>Engine I used:\u00a0 Game Maker Studio 1.4 Standard Edition</p>\n<p>Sound Effects : BFXR</p>\n<p>Background: Photoshop CS6</p>\n<p>Music: : \"Dragon Castle\" by Symphony \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (https://soundcloud.com/makai-symphony...) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Licensed under Creative Commons-ShareALike Attribution 3.0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/958/958108d78a4a6cee867756a283c27a7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ramkey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
