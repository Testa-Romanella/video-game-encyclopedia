The system should work as follows:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Generation of a certain user-selected amount (min6-max12) cars with random colors.\r\n</li><li>Automatic pathing around a racing scene, following a random route if there are multiple path options available. Racing should feel competitive, with cars accelerating at straightaways and braking into turns.\r\n</li><li>Cars should behave a little randomly, so that different cars pass each other.\r\n</li><li>Demonstrate the AI behavior in 2 different sample scenes (one standard oval track and one track with multiple path options) built with temp assets https://kenney.nl/assets/racing-kit\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:54:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a79be3dd466c1d25a8c71876b42e70ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["IndigoSane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
