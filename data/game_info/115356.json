Shortly afterwards, the kidnapper leaves the apartment and you wake up in your new environment. You must use the tools and objects found in the apartment to escape, which can be out in the open or locked away in cupboards and tables.\u00a0</p><p>Please note that this Demo is intended more as a personal timed learning project than a game. Thus it is missing things I would otherwise like to have added such as sound and a story.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb34e2a4c6d79b9fab8043dc7ba268b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Jones"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
