But be careful, the red objects are in his way and he is having a hard time finding his way around them. Slide from side to side and be patient for those that move. Not too patient though, since the alien can not survive on the Poyana Planet for too long. Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/323abbdb2413f7b32b5fadf37e569f9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Isaac Camilleri Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
