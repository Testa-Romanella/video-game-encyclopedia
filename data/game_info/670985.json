At objects falling out of your hands or at objects that break? Against the World are a game that lets you dive in and journey through a thought experiment where you can fight and interact with literally anything in the world. Let your anger out on books, mosquito's, knives and more. Enjoy the expanded fighting options of Undertale and the absurdity of the \"Earth Bound's Negative Man\" fight. Fight your way through four different stages with each three to four enemies and one boss stage. Defeat them, help them or turn insane and get one out of four different endings each round. Unlock and defeat all different enemies while listening to the acapella as if it was literally a person playing a pen on the paper game.<br/></p><p>Status:</p><p>Put on hiatus after Google Store requirements changed.</p><p>For this itch.io I had to upgrade the unity project version from 2018 to 2020 no idea if it broke anything. Technically, it's an android game. I might consider working on it again if there's enough interest.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a593c3865428490d91e925155f40fe8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GreenyNeko"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
