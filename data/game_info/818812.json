{"id": 818812, "slug": "dice-mafia", "name": "Dice Mafia", "name_original": "Dice Mafia", "description": "<p>This game/prototype was made for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam! This was our first ever game jam and while the game is not very polished we still had a lot of fun!<br/></p>\n<p>You've been framed for a crime you didn't commit! The Dice Mafia suspects you of stealing their legendary QUANTUM DICE\u2122 (not actually trademarked, at least not by us)! This prototype has you facing against your first opponent, a lower rank mafia boss with a love of soda!</p>\n<p>The mafia boss rolls a die, the result of the die decides the bullet pattern of the boss's attack in this endless bullet hell game.</p><p>CREDITS:<br/>made 3D pre-rendered assets and music:<br/>https://qordan.itch.io/<br/>made most 2D artwork, 3d textures, and the logo/cover art:<br/>https://www.twitter.com/itssmuug<br/>made some 2D artwork and did all the programming:<br/>me :) https://noidstruct.itch.io/<br/><br/></p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS, WARNING:</p>\n<p>The game over screen breaks unless you die immediately for some reason? I didn't die much during play testing cause I'm cracked (and stupid)</p>\n<p>Soda Rain doesn't do damage, Again :)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(for context: this kept happening during development and every time I thought I fixed it it EVENTUALLY came back.)<br/></p>\n<p>Crystal Spiral is pretty much impossible to dodge. Yeah this is entirely my fault I changed a few lines of code like 30 minutes before submitting and I guess that made the wave entirely impossible to dodge.</p>\n<p>Please tell me about other bugs! Me and my friends want to expand on this game and maybe turn it into something else!</p>\n<p>NON BUG ISSUES:</p>\n<p>The inconsistent art style was due to wanting to have two of my artist friends participate with me, in later releases the 3D artwork would be replaced by 2D art<br/></p>\n<p>The player moves too fast! I will get on this, perhaps even let the player decide how fast they move? :0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T13:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0abc8c20524027b56c31c4e1a01ba695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoidStruct"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
