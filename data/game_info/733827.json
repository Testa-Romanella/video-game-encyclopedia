Expect rejection, disdain and disbelief. Can you fight against all odds and prove that you don't need a pedigree? <br/></p>\n\n<p>With tight and responsive controls (gamepad recommended), you will fight tough enemies. Remember to learn their patterns, dodge and attack.\u00a0Your\u00a0knowledge\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0weapon. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The game features: <br/>- Original soundtrack composed and performed by Felipe Melo.<br/>- Wacky and funny characters inspired by regular dogs, maybe yours is here.<br/>- A full length dungeon with secrets, puzzles and a special item to open your path.<br/>- An epic battle against a boss that will crush you if you are not careful.<br/>- Full support to Xbox 360 / One controller with vibration and analog controls.<br/>- Plans to localize the game to Brazilian Portuguese, just give some time.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You can skip the first part of the demo and go straight to the dungeon from the Main Menu in case you are more interested in puzzles and combat rather than the story.<br/></p>\n<p>***This demo was a submission to \"Finally Finish Something 2022 Game Jam\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T08:13:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/937b602bef7e57687d3c3e08b79d8291.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ak1r4"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
