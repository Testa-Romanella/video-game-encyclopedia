You have been exclusively selected to participate in this inexplicably coveted project. In the first game, you will play as a wobbly boy made of bubbles (in third person), in a 3D side-scrolling world that has sharp objects at every turn. Bubbles and sharp object are a dangerous combination. The second part will be a bit more mysterious as you traverse as yourself (in first person) our 3D forest and building that are open world. You will find the game quite whimsical, with a hint of perilous risk. You can play both games using either keyboard or controller.
