The Mithra islands are plagued with a demonic infection, a rogue technologically advanced organisation conducts horrific experiments, crime families tighten their grip on the less developed areas of the landmass... And throughout it all, a figure of legend long thought defeated pulls the strings of the world's destruction.</p>\n<p>But the strings of fate are also in motion, five strangers being brought together by complete chance. Each with their own tales unfolding amid the chaos, the five must develop their friendship to survive more than they could possibly imagine.</p>\n<p>It is an organic, natural tale crafted from the real interactions of five different people, their own friendship forged right alongside their characters. Help cultivate these five as they did, expertly translated from the tabletop to your screen.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>The game controls as many RPG Maker titles do, a top-down perspective controlled with the arrow keys, battles being turn-based. You level up as the story dictates, but you must keep your gear in check and up to standard if you are to have any hope of defeating your foes! From simple mooks to the most dangerous of bosses, each move will need to be carefully considered if you are to prevail.</p>\n<p>And beyond simple enemies, so too may you encounter puzzles in the world. Do you have what it takes to contend with the crafty Cogmog the Moogle?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Story by - Skijarama, Tom117z, Lumina Starlight, Darkness, Hades Shadow 92</li><li>Programming and Design by - Skijarama, Tom117z</li><li>Bug Testing - Blank Page</li><li>Original Art by - RifTheBit</li><li>Trophy API for RPG Maker MV - Florian van Strien</li><li>Trophy API 1.6.2 Compatibility Fork - JeffreyDavis</li></ul>\n<p>The full list of outsourced assets and other credits are listed in the game's end credits.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Release Schedule:</p>\n<p>Due to the scale of the game, and the fact that the campaign, one year later, is still ongoing, Eno will be released chapter by chapter.
