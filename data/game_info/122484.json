This time we've made what's basically an extremely over the top bar fight simulator in \r\n\t<strong><em>Paint the Town Red</em></strong>. Lots of persistent blood splattering over the level and tons of various weapons around to bash the gang members with or throw at their faces.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSomewhere around day 5 or 6 when it was really coming together we decided we wanted to make this bigger and bigger. We've had lots of ideas that weren't going to fit in within 7 days so we've launched a Steam Greenlight campaign with the hopes that we can get a big, full version of this game.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThere's a few issues, but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Hopefully you enjoy it and find the various hidden weapons. We'd really appreciate it if you could take a minute to vote on the Greenlight page: \r\n\thttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/....\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOh, and the 'shooter' part of this 7DFPS entry... well you can shoot pool... and throwing stuff is sorta like shooting... and there's also this:\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tProgramming: Matthew Carr\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tArt: Shane Carr\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/82961fc4b196117d71d15dda8f6de649.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattCarr"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
