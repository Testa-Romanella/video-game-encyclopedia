As the pubs were closed, and my friends missed playing our favorite pub game. I took it on myself to create this (and learn Photon Unity Networking in the process).</p>\n<p>RULES:</p>\n<p>The goal is to not roll the lowest number\u00a0or try and roll a 21 a.k.a. \"Mexico\" .\u00a0</p>\n<p>You roll 2 dice, the highest number represents the tens number, the lowest the ones. E.g. you roll a 5 and a 4 =&gt; 54.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rolling the same number on both dice equals the hundredfold. E.g. 3 and 3 =&gt; 300.</p>\n<p>If a 21 is rolled you are safe from losing and the bet gets doubled (say you start with 2 drinks as a bet it goes up to 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.).</p>\n<ol><li>First player rolls up to 3 times. However many times they roll is the max amount of rolls everyone gets for the rest of this round.</li><li>Every person aftwerwards rolls until they are satisfied with their result. You can either reroll both dice or a single one.\u00a0</li><li>The person with the lowest roll loses and has to drink however much the bet is at that point.\u00a0</li><li>The loser becomes the new first person and the cycle repeats.</li></ol>\n<p>If 2 or more people are tied for last they will play round between themselves until there is only 1 loser (the bet can still be increased).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:26:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/98222b4fde5017a15f14e21c5a59e34c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TristanF"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
