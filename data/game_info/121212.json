The goal of the level is to collect 12 pizzas! You have to try and avoid Eye Twitching Eddy and few different spikes! Use the arrow keys to change directions. Some blocks allow you to STOP stretching while others don't. Once you pass a checkpoint, you can press that number on your keyboard to go back there at anytime.</p><p>My daughter Jasmine Finamore (10 years old) drew all the graphics while I did the coding. This was my first Ludum Dare!!!!!! What a ride it has been.
