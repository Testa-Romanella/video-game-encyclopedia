I love fantasy and epic fantasy, so I knew my secret space would be based in a similar world.  In Mirror Glade, you will find a wizards house, a waterfall for meditation, a Pavilion for study and rest, and a glade full of mystical waterfalls where you can sit and reflect. I wanted a space that had interesting shots based in directional light, and drew my inspiration from Sylvain 'Tohad' Sarrailh's art. Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:09:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe75698c8366306cc9a0f52607562991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RavenMaiden"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
