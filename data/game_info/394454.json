They automatically shoot at enemy tanks. You win by holding the central control point or by eliminating all enemy tanks.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n<p>- Control a swarm of tanks.</p>\n<p>- Capture the control point or eliminate all enemy tanks.</p>\n<p>- Campaign: Your swarm advances through a series of operations.</p>\n<p>- Quick Play: Just do 10 on 10 over and over and track your cumulative score.<br/></p>\n<p>- Custom Terrain: Terrain is procedurally generated (perlin noise). You can change the parameters to have different terrains.<br/></p>\n<p>- Use Gyro on your mobile to look around the map (mobile build will be up soon!)<br/></p>\n<p>When a tank is shot it will loose health and continue loosing health. It will retreat, heal, and then rejoin the action. The terrain is randomly generated and the tanks move around with real physics. Sometimes they will get stuck. <br/></p>\n<p>In campaign mode you have a single swarm that goes through a campaign. Depending on the campaign type new tanks are added to your swarm based on the operations that have been successful thus far.</p>\n<p>Future Directions for Development: Tutorial and Multiplayer are the main priorities right now.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T02:06:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/62596f1c4c5295e3286b55f325b22277.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bora"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
