Work together and use both skills and brains to figure out how to complete each level, without getting hit by enemies, lava, bullets or spikes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Platform Partners is a platformer about teamwork, where two players have to work together, in order to find the escape, in each of 30 levels. Upgrade your players by collecting coins on your way, or spend them on bullets, in order to defeat the enemy. The players are often seperated and have to find their own way out. However, they always have to work together, since one player might have to get the key, so that the other player can escape.</p>\n\n<p>The game also features a level creator, where you can create your own levels, which you can play with your partner. Therefore, there will always be a new level for you to complete, if you've already completed the 30 levels, guarantying many hours of play time.</p>\n\n<p>The game is available for both Windows and Mac. Should you encounter any bugs, while playing, please contact me at felix.paulsen@gmail.com or comment down below. I hope you enjoy my game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56d/56df2b5506fbfda6649cd0c48a43060d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Felix Paulsen"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
