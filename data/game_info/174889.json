Tallur's artwork 'Aurophobia, the fear of gold' on display at the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane, Australia. </p><p>You can read the Post-Mortem for this project here.</p><p>This project was done for a university project titled 'Art Jam' in which we were required to create a game based upon an artwork that resonates with us at GOMA over the course of a week. </p><p>Artist Statement:</p><p>Chromatophobia is an examination of what we as a society consider to be important. At first we chase after the gold, thinking at times we may not be making any progress at all. But upon closer inspection, you find that there are so many more amazing things surrounding you that you were unable to see until you looked away from your materials goals. You do, however, fall into the trap, just as all of us do, and begin to chase after the gold, losing sight of the other things you discovered along the way and creating a vicious cycle of discovery and loss. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbe47a320f60a1abae11cf48e36093c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Harrison Metcalfe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
