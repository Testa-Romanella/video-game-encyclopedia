Enjoy your victory, it's satisfying to look at. \"Meaningless\" (originally \"An Oddly Satisfying Game\") is a hypnotizing puzzle game for PC imagined during the Ludum Dare 49.<br/><br/>Inspired by Monument Valley art, it\u2019s a minimalist 3D isometric game.<br/>To make it simple: one level, one puzzle, one frame.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A level is divided into two parts.<br/>The first one: move the blocks to let the ball reach the finishing line. When the ball is rolling, all interactions with blocks are recorded.<br/>The second one: if the ball reaches the finishing line, the entire recorded loop is replayed endlessly. Enjoy what you made and play with the recorded loop like a VHS.<br/><br/>The experience is inspired by the satisfying videos on YouTube or TikTok.<br/>It\u2019s the pleasure to watch a smooth and repetitive process without any flaws.<br/>It seems easy, it\u2019s hypnotizing and satisfying.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T03:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffa71b1d1ba7f73dc7cf12fdbef01051.jpg", "website": "https://linktr.ee/duckreaction", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duck Reaction"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Duck Reaction"], "esrb_rating": null}
