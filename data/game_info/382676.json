The game certainly wasn't finished, but the Ludum Dare definitely was a big learning experience. Haven't had the chance to make audio for the game. The game's graphics consist purely out of Unity's built-in 3D Objects and Materials. Any feedback appreciated :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T11:03:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a880b8870acbbbfeccec762ef9ed4a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CaesarTP"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
