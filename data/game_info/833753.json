That's why this one is dated 10.08.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:58:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc0d3b4cfede5a56f3b5932530ac0bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CRA Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
