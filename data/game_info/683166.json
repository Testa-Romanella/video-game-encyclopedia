I was wondering if I can make a story-driven game in this game jam, unlike any other games I've ever made. So yes, this is experimental. Also, I want to try making another horror game, even if it's not too horrific.</p>\n<p>Controls: Only arrow keys and space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T11:24:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7edff0eef67f80f944089e6cedf40082.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheGamer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
