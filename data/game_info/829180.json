The game is pretty boring for know, I am working on implementing settings and a new game mode and that will release soon. Also the red beans are going to be replaced with actual player models. Those player models are not coming soon but what I hope will come soon is music, skyboxes, and the new game mode I was talking about earlier. If you are a programmer with GDscript, C#, or C++ and you can add multiplayer to the game that would be nice. just keep in mind you won't get paid. Also if none of the download links are working, click\u00a0\u00a0here\u00a0or here for windows\u00a0or\u00a0here for linux.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/939/9390861000afc478a25636b7994e9372.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bog_champ_pro_dev"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
