And what a golem you are! You have been given by your master a task of uppermost importance. He wishes to be entertained, but how could he be satisfied without the death of one of his servants? But as a strong golem, which is resistant to death, you always come back to life once you fall into a trap. In order to make yourself vulnerable, you have to give up your five armor plates. If you die at the correct trap, you lose one of them. You have to lose all five armor plates in order to die once and for all at the last trap. If you however die at the wrong trap, you will gain an armor plate again! So be careful where to go, dash, jump and crouch and at which place you choose to die.\u00a0\r\n  <strong>\u00a0Music:\u00a0</strong>https://soundcloud.com/rajo-tomue/golem-jazz</p>\n<ul><li>cute and brooding hand-drawn visuals and pixel art</li><li>explore a dark dungeon filled with different traps</li><li>strategical use of certain traps to lose your amour\r\n  </li><li>hard but fair, precision is the key\r\n  </li></ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  \u00a0 W, A, S, D to move</p>\n<p>SHIFT to dash</p>\n<p>SPACE to jump</p>\n<p>RCTRL to crouch</p>\n<p>SPACE to skip the intro<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  \u00a0 </p><p>\n</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bb40144045613e378d5662ac17346f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["taduchepa", "rmuell", "Frejia", "JohannesBaetz-code", "Mertyn", "Citus", "Flann", "Indrome"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
