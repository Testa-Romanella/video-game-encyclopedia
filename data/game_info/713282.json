Last time there was a disappearance like this, some mysterious sounds were heard coming from the mountains. No one is really sure what they are, but they appeared to wipe the recent memories of some people in the area where the sounds were most noticeable.\r\n</p>\n<p>The sounds are back, so as a preventative measure, residents are being forced to stay in place. This all seems terribly alarmist - surely just an excuse for leaders to abuse power. Hi-tech amnesic signals simply aren't possible, right? <br/></p>\n<p><strong>S.A.T.T.M.Y.F.</strong> is a walking simulator in which you collect flowers for some unclear purpose. Maybe something will happen if you collect enough, perhaps in those places that look suspiciously like heliports. Who knows?</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, though the final version should hopefully be out soon. The HTML5 version is known to be a bit <em>sluggish</em> (heh), which will hopefully be fixed in the final. For now, if this is a problem to you, download an executable.</p><p>Upon completion, S.A.T.T.M.Y.F will be released under the GNU GPLv3 or similar.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Arrow keys</em> to move.</li><li><em>Escape</em> to quit.</li><li><em>Enter</em> to interact with select characters/things.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T08:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e8157d319fa3bb5df3cba1070f1b16e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["XerographicPaper"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
