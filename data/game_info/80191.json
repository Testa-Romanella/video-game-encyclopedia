R  \u2026I ended up spending around 3-4 hours playing this game. I was bowled over by those amazing graphics and cool physics that has been built around the game.  Rating \u2013 5 out of 5\u201d<br/>iphoneindiablog.com<br/><br/>\u201cOverall I\u2019d have to say that Boardwalk Games is one of my favorite Skyworks games.  The attention to detail, especially when it comes to sound, is some of the best I\u2019ve seen from (Skyworks). There\u2019s even a secret spot on each game that you can hit to increase your time by ten seconds. Little touches like that tend to impress me.The mini-games are fun, and it\u2019s a challenge to try and find ways to better your score every time you play.
