The code base of the former version was too old to just be updated which is why we needed to rebuild the game from scratch. We used this opportunity to also implement a multiplayer mode and update the graphics.<br/><br/>How can I play the former / old version of Backgammon? <br/>You can only play the old version if you don't update the game and use a device that uses iOS 10.3.3 or lower. <br/><br/>Where is the \"Undo\" button?<br/>After your first move, there will be a circular arrow pointing to the left, at the bottom right of the board. Tapping the arrow will undo your move.<br/><br/>________________<br/><br/><br/>You can find our general terms and conditions here: http://tc.lite.games<br/>...and our privacy policy here: http://privacy.lite.games<br/><br/>Visit us for more free iPhone and iPad games: <br/>https://www.lite.games<br/>https://www.facebook.com/LiteGames<br/><br/>Or give us your app feedback here:<br/>support@lite.games<br/><br/>Thanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/115a3c57dedf1b220883eac5efa8d04f.jpg", "website": "https://www.lite.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["LITE Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["LITE Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
