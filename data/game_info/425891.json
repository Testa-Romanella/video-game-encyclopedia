Currently there are 5 heroes and 3 map, each hero featuring a different set of abilities. Each map with different and interesting mechanisms to play with. I will keep it a secret and you are going to find out in game.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0This game is designed to be a capstone project for the my last semester in college.  Now I\u00a0have been working on it for two months after school. Even though I\u00a0have seven courses this semester, I will still find time to work\u00a0on it to add more features. You can expect more heroes to play, make maps to choose from, and hopefully there will be a campaign mode and online multiplayer support. (I am still learning and improving my programming skill so I can't tell you the exact day when these features will be released.)\u00a0If you like my idea, please support me in Kickstarter and I\u00a0will try my best to add make the game even better!<br/></p>\n\n<p>How to control:\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Keyboard (Controller):\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move:\u00a0Arrow Keys (Left Joystick)</p>\n<p>Attack: X ( X )</p>\n<p>Dash:\u00a0C ( R2 )</p>\n<p>Skill1: A ( Y )</p>\n<p>Skill2: S ( B )</p>\n<p>Skill3: D ( R1 )</p>\n<p>Ultimate:\u00a0F ( L1 )</p>\n<p>Confirm In Menu: Enter ( X )</p>\n<p>(You have cooldown for normal skill and a gauge to fulfill before you can use your ultimate, beware of that)</p>\n<p>(Bat Hero's ultimate needs to be used when you are dashing)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c76691fad355d363e3e7606fa9ac734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xun-Ruan"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
