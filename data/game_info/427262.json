In the vast physics-based world, you can freely cut and combine objects to create tools and machines.<h3>True Craft System</h3>When you pick up a stone and hit a tree, the tree will be cut at the hit position. If you combine a wooden stick and a stone, it becomes a stone axe. In this way, you can literally \"craft\" various tools. Not only wood and stones, but almost any object in the game can be used as a material.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Vast World</h3>You can seamlessly move through the vast, procedurally generated world. You may encounter enemies while exploring the world. Craft your weapon and fight against them.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Advanced Physics Simulation</h3>Every object, including crafted tools, behaves in physics simulation. For example, the ease of swinging and destructive power of a stone axe vary depending on the length of the handle and the weight of the stone. You can also build machines such as catapults and carts to physically operate them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Simulations of air resistance, lift, buoyancy, etc. are also included.<br/><br/><h3>Change Your Avatar</h3>You can change your avatar by loading a VRM format file (not all VRM files are supported). You can also take a selfie with a third person camera.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T04:32:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec06bd73b1b91109100c357c5c04f79e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ootamato"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ootamato"], "esrb_rating": null}
