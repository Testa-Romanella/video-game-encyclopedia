You can try it with your friends. It is the fruit of everything I have learned in the last decade, fully immersed in the maker community. You can defeat monsters and bosses as well as plant flowers or cut down trees and mine minerals. Now I have the game in an early stage of development but I add features and updates almost every week.</p><p>I leave you a link to my patreon and another to the discord group. In both sites I update the information at the same time, although in discord we can communicate better.</p><p>Link to the Discord group.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Link to my patreon to support the project closely.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T03:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/122/122b7f2234ea65ff3d175bd77de6d053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaelah"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
