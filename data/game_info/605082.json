{"id": 605082, "slug": "paradoxicat", "name": "Paradoxicat", "name_original": "Paradoxicat", "description": "<p>Overview:</p>\n<p>Paradoxicat is a 2D puzzle game inspired by the\u00a0 Schrodinger's cat paradox. You play as Schrodinger, a cat who is somehow both alive and dead at the same time. Because of this, Schrodinger is able to be in two parallel versions of the same world. What you do in one world has an effect on the other and vice versa. It's up to Schrodinger to collect 10 balls of yarn using his special abilities.</p>\n\n<p>How to Play:</p>\n<p>The goal of each level is to get either version of Schrodinger to the ball of yarn. You can do this by utilizing the unique powers that each version has.</p>\n<p>Living Schrodinger plays like a normal platformer character. He can move left and right with the A and D keys and can jump with the space key. However, since he is alive, living Schrodinger can be hurt by obstacles such as lasers. Getting hit or falling down a bottomless pit will make both versions of Schrodinger have to restart the level. You can use him to press switches to help dead Schrodinger</p>\n<p>Dead Schrodinger is a ghost, so he is impervious to obstacles. He is only stopped by the boundaries of the screen or the blocks that make up each level. Dead Schrodinger can move in all four directions using the W, A, S, and D keys. You can use him to move blocks to help living Schrodinger.</p>\n<p>Switching between dead and living\u00a0 Schrodinger is the key to getting the ever entertaining\u00a0\u00a0ball of yarn in each level. You can switch between both Schrodingers\u00a0by either clicking on the side of the screen you want to switch to or pressing the Enter key.<br/></p>\n<p>Every puzzle can be solved by switching between the Schrodingers to utilize their unique abilities to effect the world for both of them. If you think you have made a mistake, you can simply click the retry button in the bottom right corner of the screen to restart the level.</p>\n\n<p>Background and Credit:</p>\n<p>Paradoxicat was made for the mini game jam 80. This jam has the theme of cats and the limitation that every texture (sprite, object, ect.) must by 8 by 8 pixels. I followed this limitation and everything, even objects that look larger than 8 by 8 pixels, are actually made up of individual 8 by 8 sprites. The only things that aren't 8 by 8 pixels are the fonts and 2 types of objects that are used to shade large portions of the screen (the sprites for these were drawn in the 8 by 8 limitation but were stretched manually in the level editor).</p>\n<p>All of the art in the game was made by me within Game Maker Studio and all sounds were taken from freesound.com.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7bada449e58703ccb9233bfeffb85cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["benhen_26"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
