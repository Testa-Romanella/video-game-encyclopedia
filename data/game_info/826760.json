Collect resources, build your village and free your monkey king. Find the perfect strategy to prepare your monkey army. But do not wait too long, your opponents aren't sleeping! :o<h3>Singleplayer</h3>You like to play solo? If you manage to free the king, you win. If all your monkeys are defeated, victory goes to the dinosaurs. In this mode you have no time pressure and therefore it can be used as a great training mode for a turbulent multiplayer game. Turn on some bots for the ultimate island fight.<h3>Multiplayer</h3>Fight your (real) opponents and be the last survivor. The last one standing wins the game! The monkey king plays a central role, too. If you free him, he will join your army.<h3>Monkey King</h3>The monkey king has decisive advantages: he collects resources way faster than normal monkeys and has so much more health points. It might be advantageous to free him fast! But oh no - be aware! The dinos have other plans :/<h3>Monkeys</h3>Hugo, Bernadette, Alfred, Herbert and so many more! Your loyal monkeys are waiting for you! What are <strong>you</strong> waiting for?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T03:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb6b6f5531658010923b66cc368f32b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dommenuss", "Pikachau", "Lenauria"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Artifact Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
