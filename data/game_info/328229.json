Catch wild PEOPLE, challenge fellow PEOPLE catchers, and face off against the chief executive of Ditfy, Inc.\u2014and president-elect of the PEOPLE!</em></p>\n<p><em>By the end of this blackly comedic adventure, your destiny will be clear as day. And what more could a PERSON want?</em></p>\n<p>A short, grim, yet affectionate parody of a global sensation from the creator's childhood. Join him for chuckles in\u00a0a time-warp to some version of\u00a01998. And if you never played the original in monochrome, then keep reading.</p>\r\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Press the\u00a0<strong>Z key</strong> to advance dialogue and narration. You will be pressing the hell out of the <strong>Z key</strong> throughout the game<strong>.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Make your avatar\u00a0walk around</strong> with the <strong>arrow keys</strong>.</p>\n<p>When your avatar is next to something interesting,\u00a0like another character, face that thing and press the <strong>Z key</strong> to <strong>inspect it</strong>\u2014in the case of another character, <strong>he or she will speak to you</strong>. Somebody, somewhere, will have some vital clue for you.</p>\n<p>In some places, you will be attacked. The <strong>field screen</strong> will disappear and be replaced with the <strong>battle screen</strong>.\u00a0You will automatically deploy\u00a0<strong>the PERSON at the top of\u00a0your roster</strong> to fight the attacking PERSON.</p>\n<p>The PEOPLE politely fight by\u00a0<strong>taking turns</strong>. In\u00a0each turn, you can take one of four actions: \"<strong>FIGHT</strong>\" brings up a menu of commands to give your PERSON; \"<strong>ITEM</strong>\" brings up an inventory of supplies for you to use; \"<strong>PPL</strong>\" brings up your roster of PEOPLE to deploy in place of your current PERSON; and \"<strong>RUN</strong>\" will make you flee the battle. Press the <strong>Z key</strong> to <strong>confirm</strong> selected menu commands; press the\u00a0<strong>X key</strong> to <strong>cancel</strong> them and return to a previous menu.</p>\n<p>Each PERSON has a limited number of <strong>health points</strong>; when these run out <strong>the</strong> <strong>PERSON is dead and gone forever!</strong> Some <strong>items</strong> can recover health points before that happens.</p>\n<p>You can use such items in the <strong>field screen</strong> by pressing the <strong>Enter key</strong>\u00a0or<strong> Return key</strong> to bring up the main menu. From there you can also <strong>see the status</strong> of your PEOPLE, <strong>switch their order</strong>\u00a0in the roster, and <strong>view a summary of your avatar</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n<p>I tried to write this game program a number of times. In the end, the only natural way to do it\u00a0was writing it in Haskell using the\u00a0Glasgow Haskell Compiler.\u00a0Among many other benefits, this allowed me to express much of the game in\u00a0the embedded language\u00a0Yampa, created by <strong>Henrik Nilsson</strong> and <strong>Antony Courtney</strong>, and maintained by <strong>Ivan Perez</strong>.</p>\n<p>Linkage to your system's\u00a0audio and video\u00a0subsystems appears courtesy of\u00a0Simple DirectMedia Layer\u00a0by <strong>Sam Latinga</strong> and colleagues.
