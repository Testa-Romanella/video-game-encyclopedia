Rudely awakened by guards knocking down your door, you're forced at swordpoint to Prague, where the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II is forcing occultists of all kinds to search for the Philosopher's Stone.</p>\n<p>You're a witch, not an alchemist. You have no idea what you're doing. But they left you with a whole laboratory and a lot of alchemical books, and some of the formulae look like they could help you get out of here...</p>\n<p>Gameplay is disturbingly similar to conducting academic research. You've been warned.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT: Evan J.
