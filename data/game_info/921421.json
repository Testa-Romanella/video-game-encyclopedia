The player controls a single branch that represents a human life on a way to reach an abstract life goal. The speed and richness of the branch are progressively decreasing. The growing and decaying branch could divide itsel by dropping an heir that could finish the desired life goal or try to reach a destination if its own. We'd like to reference great flesh classics like Pac-Man or Snake and use the aesthetic of minimalism that should evoke the insignificance yet an unbreakable resilience of human desires.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b5748c59e1e5a7c2c6b15bb9b4a9345.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["mlozanek", "Lucinaa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
