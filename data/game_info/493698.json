Dale and a few other coworkers convinced me to buy a Tandy Color Computer as my first computer; Dale was soon to sell his first game, Doubleback, to Tandy.</p>\n<p><strong>The original Temple of ROM</strong> was developed on a modest setup: a very early silver Coco1 with chiclet keys, RCA color TV, EDTASM cartridge, and a cassette tape recorder.</p>\n<p><strong>The source code for the game</strong> was on three 20 minute cassettes, meaning that each debugging session or program build required a lengthy and insanely convoluted process of swapping tapes and making meticulous backups.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspired by the Atari game Adventure</strong> and the fantasy novels of Katherine Kurtz, I developed a dungeon exploration game with a large, scrolling maze, populated with monsters and treasures.</p>\n<p><strong>Tandy liked my game</strong> and agreed to buy it, and happily it sold quite well in stores. Now, 38 years later, I have freshened up the game a bit, expanding the maze by 45% and adding a few more challenging monsters.</p>\n<p>Feel free to peruse the source code for this project:</p>\n<p>Temple of ROM II project on Github.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also build your own levels!</p>\n<p>Temple of ROM II online level builder.</p>\n<p><em>I've also included\u00a0the original Temple of ROM game in all its 1980s glory.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T02:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cdbd2d0bc11ecd8e724a58873d43bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rick Adams"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
