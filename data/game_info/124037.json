Then add a Program Sheet and perhaps a Marble machine or two. The Program Sheet is where you will edit the song's \"score\".</p>\n<p>The Beat Machine needs to be connected to the Program Sheet to trigger reading of rows on the sheet. Click the Beat Machine you placed and notice the 3 buttons in the pop-up. Click on one and you will see a line. Now move the mouse over the Program Sheet device and click to connect. Similarly you can connect the Program Sheet's signal outputs to the Marble Machine or other Devices.</p>\n<p>In the Program Sheet's pop-up you click or drag over the cells to mark the ones which will generate a signal when the row is read.</p>\n<p>Now place a Snare Drum, from the Percussive category, somewhere below the Marble Machine and press Play to see what happens.</p>\n<p>Settings</p>\n<p>Besides the common options like sound volume and screen resolution you will note a Sound Data drop-down. This allows you to select which Sound Font to use. A Sound Font tells the game what an instrument sounds like and the sound can differ quite a bit depending on which Sound Font you use. Some might sound quite realistic while others sound very synthetic.</p>\n<p>Just do a search for Sound Fonts on the internet or visit http://www.synthfont.com/links_to_soundfonts.html for some links. Copy the SF2 file into the game's <em>.\\muchine_Data\\StreamingAssets\\SoundData\\</em> folder and restart the game to see the new Sound Font in the settings.</p>\n<p>enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/444/44443eda8c765b85ca8a6f531bd73d1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leslie Young"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
