Ranging from melancholic ambient explorations to intense high-energy action, the game shifts through various stages.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMeant to be played in low lighting with headphones or a loud sound system.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlayable with options for <strong><em>keyboard OR gamepad controls</em></strong>. Originally devised as a twin-stick shooter, the control system has evolved to also include an aim/lock firing mechanic for play with just five keys, or one stick and one button. This method may increase the difficulty however.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tKludge = '\r\n\t<em>An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole'</em>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game engine used is the ZGameEditor, with most graphics being code based.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe sound design is realized through the SunVox modular tracker,. using synths, samples, and some effects chains coordinated with the gameplay.  Old analog and digital synthesizers are programmed and recorded, samples chosen, and manipulated.   Some sequences are played back through the trackers interface while some notes are triggered directly from the game's code.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>NOTE</strong>:The game is currently un-optimized and not tested on low-end hardware,. runs great on a middle of the road desktop system.  Further updates will tend towards greater optimizations as bottlenecks are uncovered. (pending support)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f5/0f5ae051c1c7bef5ebec138a5ffab6ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
