Please read the Notes section below for <strong>how to play</strong> as well as suggestions for how best to run the game. IF YOU USE A CONTROLLER, USE THE D-PAD!</p>\n<p>Quick ProTip for Beginners: don't pick up too many pets too fast because it can get overwhelming!<br/></p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>A Walk Around The Block is an isometric singleplayer action game where you try to get the highest score before time runs out. Points can be added or deducted by various actions you or your pets do. Each additional pet you're walking multiplies the number of points you get per yellow orb. <br/></p>\n<p>There are three types of pets: Dogs, Chickens and ChickenDogs, which each have their own behaviors and interactions with the environment. <br/></p>\n<p>The player can walk up to 4 pets at a time, each controlled by one of the \"face buttons\" on your controller or the keys IJKL on your keyboard. The leashes' color corresponds to the button pressed to control that pet. Players can hold down the button to keep a constant pull on the leash or tap the button to give the leash a yank to quickly pull a pet toward the player.<br/><br/>Walking around the block you'll encounter neighbors, chipmunks and worms. Dogs love to be petted, but will try to chase down chipmunks. Chickens ignore the chipmunks, will eat worms and will annoy people. ChickenDogs will destroy anything they encounter.<br/></p>\n<p>The player levels up after each 1000 points which affects how quickly you can move and how powerful your pets are.

Also, analog sticks work mostly but D-Pad responds a lot better. \r\nPlugging in a controller will sometimes make the keyboard no longer playable. \r\n    <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p>TLDR: WASD and IJKL\r\n    </p>\n<p>W - Move Up\u2b06\ufe0f\r\n    </p>\n<p>A -\u00a0 Move Left\u2b05\ufe0f\r\n    </p>\n<p>S - Move Down\u2b07\ufe0f\r\n    </p>\n<p>D - Move Right\u27a1\ufe0f \r\n    </p>\n<p>IJKL - to pull/yank the corresponding pet (if you have one)<br/></p>\n<p>I - Tapping <strong>yanks</strong> the Yellow leashed pet.
