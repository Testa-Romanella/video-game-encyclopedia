All three have been turned to stone by an evil plague. \u00a0A bouquet of 12 flowers can bring them back. This is a calm farming game that comes with very few stressors.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Weed your garden to gain points. Ghosts help you automate the process.</p>\n\n<p>Plant flowers using your points. Careful:\u00a0the more flowers you buy, the more expensive they become.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Water your flowers to make them ripe for the harvest. Cloud trees will periodically rain on your flowers.</p>\n\n<p>Autos - like Cloud Trees and Planter Golems - will help you reach your goal of 3 bouquets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T05:20:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a8/6a852381ad0fa164a98eee3c9056b0c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rockwillck"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
