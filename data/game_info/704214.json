A dolphin who is dedicated to do its best in order to destroy the plastics. You will swim near to the surface in harmony.. then you will dive to the dangerous land of plastics. If you manage to build up speed in correct manners, you will feel the power you have.. if not.. then you will probably die horribly due to the plastics in your organs. You will constantly need fresh air so you will swim back and forth between the surface and the deep water. (well.. that is not entirely true but it sounds better than \"You will pick up hp's while airborne\")</p>\n<p>The game is fun if you play it the way i do and you probably will not because i did not have enough time to create a proper tutorial.</p>\n<p>:/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3efa610bcb54aac5a08c7a015f34118f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serdetay"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
