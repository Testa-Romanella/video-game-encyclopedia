Soon after arrival you lose contact to an outpost. This moon, which seemed so promising at first, turns out to be a deathtrap. You were never alone here and now they are coming for you...</p>\n<p>Defend the base tower in the middle! The turrets around it protect it but are attacked as well. To assign targets to the towers you will have to focus the drone's beam on the monsters.<br/>It's enough to target the monsters once, the turrets will do the rest once the target is locked.</p>\n<p>Just survive the attacking waves and make it to the shuttle!</p>\n<p><strong>Short notes on the controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Q/E - move camera up/down<br/>Mouse wheel - focus the beam of the drone<br/>W/A/S/D - Move forward, left, back, right, as in any other game, or bring the mouse close to the edge of your screen.</p>\n<p>If you can't find any monsters you maybe need\u00a0to adjust your monitor\u00a0brightness a bit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b1520003e9f51106e926c136bfc35b16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Skydra"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
