{"id": 438064, "slug": "projekt-kaktus", "name": "Projekt Kaktus", "name_original": "Projekt Kaktus", "description": "Features and Storyline\r\n<p>Projekt Kaktus revolves around its cactus protagonist, Jacktus: literally fallen from the sky, he soon finds himself in the crosshairs of some aggressive tumbleweeds with an axe to grind\u2026 and a pretty menacing Peyote. Starting from a dilapidated cemetery, Jacktus runs towards danger through a desert, a mostly abandoned town and a big dark cave, where the Peyote is waiting for him.</p>\n<ul><li>JACKTUS: you\u2019re the coolest cactus in the west\u2026 \u2018nuff said \u2018bout that</li><li>SPINES: your spines are your health, so manage them carefully, shoot the evil tumbleweeds but pay attention not to die in the process;</li><li>RECHARGE: we don\u2019t want to kill you too easily, so stop your shooting once every now and then; when your recharge bar is full, your spines will be replenished in a snap;</li><li>ENEMIES: the only fools brave (or stupid) enough to face a gunslinger cactus are tumbleweeds, and you will encounter them in a couple of different fashions</li></ul>\n<p>The main feature of the game is that Jacktus\u2019 attack is also his health, meaning that the player has to carefully manage Jacktus\u2019 spines to survive; there are ways to charge up the spines again, some more straightforward and slow, others more immediate but prone to backfiring (aka Debuffs). The settings change in tone and in gameplay: the sepia-toned areas are mainly platforming with some light shooting, while the black &amp; white areas are more intense and dangerous.</p>\n<p>Another thing to mention is the Peyote\u2019s attack pattern: he\u2019s the big boss at the end of the level and it has 4 different attacks, one from his main body, the other from the small peyotes attached to its lower end.</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPED BY:</strong></p>\n<p>WE NEED A NAME STUDIO TEAM (EVENT HORIZON SCHOOL PADUA, YEAR 1, 2019/2020)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:08:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1fbb1434dba4cff85d40aea43c0ca38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Event Horizon School"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
