To win the game, stay alive collecting as many treasures (coins) as you can, and\u00a0reach the warp zone just under the\u00a050th floor.</li><li>You cannot go back to previous floors.</li><li>The dungeon is revealed bit by bit\u00a0as you explore. The number of the\u00a0current floor, your coordinates and percentage of visited spots is displayed at the top of the screen.</li><li>Beware of spike traps scattered throughout the floor, as they will reduce your life energy. Spikes can be destroyed with bombs.</li><li>This game has permadeath, i.e. if you die, it's over.\u00a0There is no \"save game\" feature.</li><li>You can increase your life energy, buy more bombs and get\u00a0a map of the current floor by finding the hidden merchants.</li><li>Bombs only destroy walls and traps located immediately adjacent to the spot where you drop them.</li><li>Bombs\u00a0don't deal any damage to enemies, but\u00a0they can deal a lot of damage to you, so move away fast as soon as you drop one.<br/>\n</li><li>You gain experience points for each enemy killed. Your experience\u00a0level increases when you reach the limit for the current level. Higher levels = more powerful attacks.</li><li>Enemies get stronger and spawn more often the deeper you are.</li><li>When the game is over, your stats will be recorded in a file called \"hi_scores.txt\". This is just to keep\u00a0a history of all your playthroughs and achievements.</li><li>If you don't like the default color schemes you can change them in the file \"color_schemes.txt\", as long as you keep them in the same format. The game randomly picks a color scheme for each floor from that list. You can modify the existing colors and also\u00a0remove or add new entries.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T08:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bf8153d5c12c75854956633e1fb24c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fernando Aires Castello"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
