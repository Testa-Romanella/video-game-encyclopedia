{"id": 978193, "slug": "athena-crisis", "name": "Athena Crisis", "name_original": "Athena Crisis", "description": "Athena Crisis is a modern retro turn-based strategy game that presents multiple gripping single-player campaigns alongside sync and async online multiplayer, as well as a full map and campaign editor, leaderboards, player skills and unit powers. Fans of Into The Breach, Advance Wars, or Fire Emblem will feel right at home in Athena Crisis!<br/><br/>Victory in Athena Crisis can be obtained in multiple ways: defeat all enemy units to clear a map, take over your opponent\u2019s structures and bases, escort units to an escape zone, or simply survive for a period of time against overwhelming odds. Outwit, outbuild, and outfight your opponents to become the best Athena Crisis player.<h3>Take Command</h3>Command 40+ infantry, ground, naval and air units in turn-based battles. Each structure you capture will net you more resources each turn, which you can use to build more powerful units and expand even further! Here's the twist: the actions within your game world can echo across to other players' experiences, and vice versa - creating a dynamic, interconnected universe!<br/><h3>Think Tactically</h3>Beware the fog! Proceeding too far behind enemy lines may leave your units exposed to attacks from unexpected directions, or even at risk of\u2026dinosaur munches? Strategic thinking will be required to take advantage of terrain and lines of sight.<br/><h3>Skills and Powers</h3>Customize your gameplay experience with unique unlockable skills and powers: Unlock new units, apply status effects or completely change how some unit mechanics work.
