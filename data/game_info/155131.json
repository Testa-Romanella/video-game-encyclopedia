You have a coffee press which magically restores coffee when pumped (X). But it only holds 4 pours and you need 2 pours to fill a cup! Keep that pump hand ready!</p>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>I spent lots and lots of time in this game's file, and it sure doesn't look it. I threw away several different ideas before landing at this, but it came out surprisingly well. Play as 'Patrick' trying to serve that good coffee to absent customers. If you care about your results, try to do it fast and without spilling\u00a0(overfilling) any! The game is themed off a Waypoint Radio podcast episode title, simply, 'Pump-Action Patrick'.</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM July 2018</p>\n<p>Waypoint Community Game Jam 2 (Big Boy Season)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b0/5b0188192bb37d781a1ee84da08b2fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
