A popular story told to children before bedtime, the tale follows a little monkey that mistakes the moon's reflection on the surface of the lake as the actual moon. Fearing that the moon has fallen into the water, the monkey bands together with his friends to scoop it out of the water, only to find that it was a reflection all along. This folktale serves as a reminder to young children to think before acting, and that situations may not be as they seem upon first glance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:07:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b8/0b832b7f3cb43ee6360fee0efdf7fdc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["kdaiii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
