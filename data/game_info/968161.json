Use your superior driving skills to avoid them, or turn your tank's cannon and blast them away.<br/><br/>Each time you fire and hit a vehicle, you can gain extra time, and if you achieve consecutive hits, you can accumulate combo points and earn bonus time based on your maximum combo. However, you need to reload your ammo after each shot, during which time you'll be unable to fire again. If you get stuck in traffic, you'll be helpless, and the smoke from the destroyed vehicles will block your vision, making it hard to see ahead. You need to make quick decisions about whether to continue firing to extend your time or to use your ammo to clear obstacles.<br/><br/><br/>Remember that you're driving a tank, a powerful vehicle that can also ram other vehicles aside. However, this action can cause damage to your tank, slow you down, and interrupt your combo. Use it wisely.<h3>STAGES</h3>The road is not always the same, and you need to adapt to different conditions:<br/><br/>\u25cf The wide and bright forest road is always friendly at the beginning.<br/><br/>\u25cf The dark temple ruins trail will obscure your view of the road ahead.<br/><br/>\u25cf The crowded city roads have narrow two-lane roads with fixed obstacles, but there are also clever spaces outside the lanes that you can use.<br/><br/>\u25cf Space offers a magical environment with unexpected hazards.<h3>POWERFULL TANKS</h3><br/>The game offers 14 different World War II tanks, each with its own unique characteristics such as high acceleration, top speed, thick armor, or short reload time. Try to earn rewards and unlock all of them by completing each level.<h3>CHALLENGE MODE</h3><br/>Challenge mode is available for each environment you pass.
