In this game, you participate in a \"game show\" where you are the contestant before an invisible (but loud)\u00a0audience. You must organize your pills through a number puzzle while enduring the constant jeering and laughter of the audience. I chose this topic because it's a nightmare I have somewhat often, actually.</p>\n<p>I settled on the core gameplay loop fairly early on, so most of my development time has been focused on improving the presentation of the game to better convey the theme. I created assets for the stage and played around with the lighting and used copious scripting to create systems for the different monitors and audio. In the end, this somewhat overextended me a bit and I needed to reel myself back in to make the deadline. The most fun part of developing the game was easily the scripting, because I like scripting. Code is fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe6b50dfd5bf83c79686291a703d033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ThisisMyClassPage"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
