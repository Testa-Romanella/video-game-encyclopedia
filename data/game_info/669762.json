I Used A Few\u00a0Tutorials In Order To Make This Game ,Which Is Why There Are No Ads In The Game. This Game Was Made In Order For Me To Build An Audience So That Once I Start Making Proper Games , I May Have A Small Community Of People That Are Aware of Me. I Also Just Enjoy Making Games And Am Still Learning The Art Of Game Development.\u00a0Hope You Enjoy!!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/690/6905b72086317d4297a1e722fbeadaa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Blue Diamond Studioz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
