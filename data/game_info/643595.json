Little do you know that you are a child that cares about the world around you. I did NOT make the low poly earth model and got off the unity asset store from Ryan Zehm. Important: The right controller ray only works with buttons but the left only works for picking up trash. This was only tested on oculus. I am not sure if it works for wmr, valve index, or htc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T04:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eaa/eaa59975c018cdb552a9cc63fb14d0ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChefMe727"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
