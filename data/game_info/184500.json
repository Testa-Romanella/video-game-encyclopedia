Will probably pick at it over the next week for completions sake. If you're interested in playing the final version check back later.</p>\n<p>TODO:<br/>- Add audio<br/>- More options to entertain/feed the cats<br/>- Better cat wandering<br/>- More balanced spawning algorithm</p>\n<p>Written in java from scratch using Slick-Util/LWJGL for openGL wrappers.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE (08/12/17)</p>\n<p>Uploaded a feature complete version. Could still benefit from balancing and doesn't have any sound but its close to the game I envision at the start.</p>\n\n<p>GAME PLAY</p>\n<p>Click the cats thinking of hearts to give love, place down food, water and toys when they're needed.
