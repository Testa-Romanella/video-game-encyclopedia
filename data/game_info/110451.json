It was released in the website's prime, back when it was owned by Life Savers.</p>\n<p>Lost in time since then, I remade the game from scratch so it can be played on modern computers and Android devices! This is a faithful remake with subtle differences, most notably in how it controls. To play, you use the mouse to aim and hit the ball towards that direction. The further the mouse cursor is pulled back, the bigger the shot. For Android, use your finger!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bd68fb9d46e83ba84ec8afb8281337f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Jack-of-All Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
