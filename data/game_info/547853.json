While the game itself is simple, I create this game to brush off my game development skills. Hopefully, I would make more games in the future. One more thing, this game does not have AI, so you either play by yourself or play with someone else. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T10:20:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/22159d479bc119b3ddafd0a7baf4d151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shadowhen89"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
