I modified the sprite sheets in Aseprite and built the levels in Tiled.\u00a0My aim was to create a new story but keep the game's look and feel as close to the original Oracles games as possible. The story is much shorter than a real Zelda game, and doesn't feature any dungeons or bosses, but is a fun bit of nostalgia for fans of the\u00a0GBC\u00a0Zelda games. The game should take 30-60 mins to complete. This game features an AUTOSAVE that saves whenever a level is loaded or a key item is obtained.</p>\n<p>You can go to /Legend of Zelda Fangame/Resources/State.txt to delete or modify the saved game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Z - Sword (Item needed)</li><li>X - Talk;\u00a0Secondary Item</li><li>C - Cycle Secondary Item</li><li>Space - Jump (Item needed)</li><li>Arrows - Move</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:17:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc0ee98d3a307561e843694af8dee05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mattmd"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
