Movement speed of the racket during bounce affects speed of ball. You can try to play faster balls but it makes game harder. Goal is to minimize overall ball in play time in all levels, which is displayed after beating last level.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 21 levels to beat. Each level contains unique bricks layout with complexity varying among them.</p>\n<p>It takes about 30 - 40 minutes to beat whole game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7af/7af5ee492532d30df81c1d249d6b8e6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blazej"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
