As a gameplay animator my job\u00a0 is mainly focused on combat and I needed to understand how that works from a gameplay point of view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I created this game while also learning how to code in game maker studio, the art, code and animations are all done by myself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The prototype has a few objects that you can interact with, lots of bugs, if you go back from where you came from you will have everything respawned. The main focus is the boss fight which in itself is rudimentary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 For any questions feel free to contact me at : pixelartisland@gmail.com</p>\n<p><strong>Controls :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move Left</strong> - left arrow</li><li><strong>Move Right</strong>- right arrow</li><li><strong>Sheathe</strong>\u00a0Sword - W</li><li><strong>Unsheathe Sword</strong> - S</li><li><strong>Switch Direction</strong> - CTRL + Left arrow/Right arrow</li><li><strong>Dodge back </strong>- Arrow key + SHIFT\u00a0</li><li><strong>Attacks\u00a0</strong>- Arrow Keys + SPACE</li><li><strong>Use/Interact</strong> = E</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd36d4c93a34e2aefc7d4fb9df787634.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixelartisland"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
