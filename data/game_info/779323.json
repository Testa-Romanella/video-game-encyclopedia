Inspired by Don't Starve and Minecraft.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move, E to open the inventory, and Q to craft with the recipe on the slider. Click on any food (or bobbing item) in your inventory to eat it. Keep your hunger bar up, because a full bar will heal you and an empty bar will deplete your health. Hold space to break trees or rocks. While breaking a tree with no tools, there's a chance that you can cut your hand. If you can survive for 15 minutes, you will be rescued by a helicopter and therefore win the game.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Hero_Holmes360 for hosting the Ronocon Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Music: \"Cool space music\" by @owaiso (Scratch user)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T13:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bcedab11c4c738b9080065212ffae329.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["crazyera"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
