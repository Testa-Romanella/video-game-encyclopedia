All the action happened simultaneously in game world and places could be seen from the map or at the ground level. Individual characters could also be seen in larger battles (in which they either survived or died \u2014 Gandalf alone could easily defeat a hundred orcs). If the battle is quite small (less than 100 units approximately) it can be watched on ground level. Otherwise it will be only displayed numerically. On ground level characters could acquire objects and talk with computer-controlled friendly characters (such as Radagast or Tom Bombadil).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753292d5a5792dd004033f0fdada95f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 309, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II"], "developers": ["Krome Studios Melbourne", "Melbourne House"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Melbourne House", "Krome Studios Melbourne"], "esrb_rating": null}
