This also works with getting the extending cube facing upwards again.</p>\n<p>Tip: You can step up an extending cube(and only the extending cube)\u00a0without a hole, and this would eventually be required. The best way to do it is hold W while looking in the direction it is in. If that doesn't work, try changing the placement or angle of the cube and try again.</p>\n<p>A test subject(You) has been selected to complete a number of tests in a facility.
