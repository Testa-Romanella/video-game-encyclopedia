Press [R] to reload the level.</p>\n\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>Sometimes the Arrows from an object disapear. If you can, rotate the object, otherwise you'll have to reset the Level with [R]<br/>Some mirrors dont reflect the light when it comes from an object that is not supposed to be the solution here.<br/>All levels are playable, if you think a bug is preventing you from finishing a level, you are probably on the wrong way. Try something else or reset the level if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Devs:</p>\n<p>Bluegru<br/>SirRaynor<br/>Karim<br/>Cireeeee<br/>Razeac</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/908/90872bea47b89d079736af8226437031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["karim2989", "Bluegru", "Razeac", "cireeeee", "SirRaynor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
