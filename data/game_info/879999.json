SAFE PITCH ANGLE:  30'\r\nMIN. SAFE PITCH ANGLE: -30'\r\n    PITCH OUTSIDE OF THESE MARGINS PLACES PRESSURE STRESS ON HULL\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHUD \r\n-------\r\n\r\nElements detected on sonar are displayed in the following format:\r\n\r\n              ^ 100 FT\r\n              * 200 FT\r\n  \r\n^ denotes absolute depth in feet. \r\n* denotes distance from the vessel. \r\n\r\nDistance may not be displayed for all items. \r\n\r\nBLUE SQUARES denote synthetic read-outs: These provide absolute depth measurements\r\nfor nearby terrain features. The choice of depth for the vessel's manoeuvres can be decided\r\nfrom these measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMANDS\r\n--------\r\n\r\nSWEEP &lt;TIME IN SECONDS&gt;\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: SWEEP 2\r\n\r\nPerforms a sonar sweep in the direction of travel for the given number of seconds. \r\nApprox. 5 seconds permits a single 360-degree sweep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVE SONAR \r\n\r\nToggle continuous sonar sweeps on and off. \r\n\r\nWARNING: The ORIGIN of a sonar pulse CAN be determined by other vessels in some conditions. \r\nIt is recommended that you use continuous sweeping only to get initial surveys of the terrain.\r\nIt is ill-advised to continuously sweep once an enemy position has been detected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVE &lt;ABSOLUTE DEPTH IN FEET&gt;\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: DIVE 368\r\n\r\nDive to (or surface to) a specific depth in feet. \r\n\r\nWARNING: As a buoyant object subject to the laws of physics, the vessel will overshoot or undershoot\r\nthis depth by a given margin depending on velocity. i.e. A longer dive will result in a more \r\nnoticeable overshoot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFULL STOP \r\n\r\nStop all motion and all commands immediately (including diving and loading of torpedoes). \r\nNOTE: This does not cancel ACTIVE SONAR.\r\nWARNING: After being in motion the vessel will still have some momentum. It is not possible to immediately \r\ncome to a complete stop. This must be factored into commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEADY &lt;SPEED&gt; \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: STEADY 6\r\n\r\nBegin steady forward motion at the specified speed.\r\nNOTE: This command is a toggle and other commands can be run while steady forward motion is in progress.\r\nSteady forward motion will continue during other manoeuvres (like DIVE and PITCH) until canceled with \r\nFULL STOP. \r\n\r\nRecommended speeds:\r\n===================\r\n3        = Crawl. Useful during close combat.\r\n6  - 8   = General forward motion when terrain is known and clear\r\n12 - 22  = Fast escape or intercept. Not recommended when close to dangerous terrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURN ABOUT\r\n\r\nRotate the vessel around to face the opposite direction. \r\nThis process takes several seconds during which no other commands can be issued (exc. FULL STOP).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORWARD &lt;SECONDS&gt;\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: FORWARD 4\r\n\r\nMove forward at the slowest speed for the specified number of seconds. This can be used to 'edge forward'\r\nwhen STEADY is inappropriate (e.g. because of terrain proximity)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPITCH &lt;ANGLE IN DEGREES&gt; \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: PITCH -29\r\n\r\nPitch the vessel up or down, affecting all subsequent motion. PITCH 0 returns the vessel to a neutral position\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nLEFT FACING\r\n===========\r\n\r\n30 DEGREES\r\n          \\\r\n           \\\r\n       -----0 NEUTRAL  &lt;\r\n           /\r\n          /\r\n-30 DEGREES\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT FACING\r\n===========\r\n\r\n             30 DEGREES\r\n            /\r\n           /\r\n&gt; NEUTRAL 0 ------\r\n           \\\r\n            \\\r\n            -30 DEGREES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLESTATIONS\r\n\r\nPrepare the vessel and crew for combat. This is a prerequisite for loading and firing torpedoes and takes a number of seconds \r\nto complete. This order cannot be undone: The vessel REMAINS IN THIS STATE until enemy vessels are destroyed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Crew stress accrues for every hour spent in combat, which modifies the speed and effectiveness of various orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD TORPEDO\r\n\r\nLoad a torpedo for firing. The vessel must be in BATTLESTATIONS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE TORPEDO\r\n\r\nFire a loaded torpedo in the direction (and PITCH) of travel. The initial travel speed of the torpedo is fairly low and \r\nit will take a number of seconds to become visible on the HUD.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The maximum visibility range of a fired torpedo is approx. 250FT. After this point, it is only visible \r\nfrom sonar scans.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T07:13:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/520553b2dd9a3677a6d904ebe3e63234.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["d w roberts"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
