Your success in the mini-games will determine how strong the pen is by the end of the night. This will be tested, as the werehogs will try their hardest to break free at the end of the game!</p>\n<p>WARNING! Uhhh, this game is scuffed beyond belief. Think of it more as a conceptual experience! Have fun squishing the pigs around. When in doubt, hit space bar to progress!</p><p>*[Final Screen is a dark dead end. Oops!
