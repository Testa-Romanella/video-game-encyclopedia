This station works largely autonomously, but can receive commands from you via the AstrOS operating system.                                   Sell the mined raw materials on markets in space and on earth.             Research unknown samples found during mining operations to             unlock new resources and build your station into a real player in the space mining business.</p>\n<p>The game is developed and tested in Firefox only. If you have issues with Chrome&amp;Co. I recommend switching to this browser.</p>\n\r\nTutorial\r\n<p>I wrote an extensive in-game tutorial. It is opening after the game has started. Hope it helps to overcome the learning curve these kinds of managment games tend to have.\r\n</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\nhttps://www.bensound.com (New Dawn, Background Music)</p>\n<p>https://unicode-table.com/en/ (for all icons)<br/></p>\n<p>http://cliparts.co/clipart/2397655 (part of the logo)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fb/8fb6c3f8f703b34f14f1952538568cc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Humane Tiger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
