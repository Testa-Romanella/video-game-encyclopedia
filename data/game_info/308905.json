The Pumpking can only be defeated with a Magic Potion, whose ingredients are also inside caves and vaults (Wing of Bat, Molten Lava, Dried Bones / Rib, Fresh Hemlock, Scales of a\u00a0Newt and\u00a0 Poisoned Frog). On top of that, the crypts are locked, so that the Esmeralda has to jump onto her broom to search the surrounding landscape for the fitting keys.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect all six ingredients, stir it together in the witch\u2019s hut to make a Magic Potion (carefully poured into a Magic Vial)\u00a0and with this take the Magic Broom from the Pumpking. The keys to the crypts need to be collected first (luckily their colour coded), they have been scattered randomly in the upper world at the start of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2d/d2db59c4a2b59565141daf22027ab6bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aenever"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
