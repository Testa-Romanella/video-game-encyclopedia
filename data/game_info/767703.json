{"id": 767703, "slug": "twilight-sail", "name": "Twilight Sail", "name_original": "Twilight Sail", "description": "<p>The Age of Sail is in its Twilight years.\r\n</p>\n<p>The wind-taming  magnificient vessels that once ruled the oceans are soon to be a relic  of bygone days as the seas are taken over by new steam-powered ships.\r\n</p>\n<p>You  commandeer a trading ship in the Carribean struggling to keep up with  the new rivals in the horizon. Master the winds to outspeed and  outmanouver your foes - or get stuck tacking against a headwind while  your coal burning rivals snatch the best trade opportunities!\r\n</p>\n<p>Are you determined to stay relevant in the changing landscape or do you accept you are just delaying the inevitable?\r\n</p>\n<p>The  game is made in Unity by Ville Talonpoika and Leo J\u00e4ms\u00e4. Models were  created in Blender and music in LMMS. Soundtrack is partly our own  creation and partly Finnish folk seafaring music. <br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY</p><p>*Gamepad recommended*<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use left and right to turn your sails</li><li>Use A and D to turn the rudder</li><li>Press down to drop anchor</li><li>Press Control for birds eye view</li></ul>\n<p>You gain doubloons by transporting trade goods. Each harbor produces one good and wants another. The wanted good is the upper one. Your ship can carry one unit of given type. Doubloons are depleted over time and the game ends when they run out. New enemies will spawn every 10 years. The final score is the year until which you stay in business! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T02:19:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70d50b46706f411100271eba70ee2d56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Roboimuri"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
