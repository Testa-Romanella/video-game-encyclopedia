Your pieces can stack on top of each other and they start the game nested, off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece.<br/></p>\n<p>Your memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is covering before you move it. As soon as a player has three like-colored pieces in a row, he wins \u2014 except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that finishes a three-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's two other pieces in that row, the game continues.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T09:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/820a215c45ecf8df9a1dcdf9481131a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yoonwookim"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
