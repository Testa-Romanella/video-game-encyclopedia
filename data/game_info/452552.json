DEMO+. This update will be exclusive to this collection for the duration of this bundle.<br/></p>\n<p>This collection can be purchased in the bundle or by itself as a donation. Regardless of how you purchase, the proceeds will be split between:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</li><li>Community Bail Fund</li></ul>\n<p><strong>However, we recommend donating through the bundle to access this collection, as it bypasses  itch's cut and donates all the money you put in!</strong><strong> As of the time of writing, you can find the files on page 25 of the bundle's downloads once you access them.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Some of the games have exclusive updated content added after the jams as well. We hope you enjoy them and continue to show support for this cause.<br/><br/><strong>EDIT: </strong>We've added two zip files that have the entire collection of games in it. No more clicking one by one if you want to see everything our devs made! There's a zipped variation (all games are still zipped within the base zip file to preserve size when extracted, 1.35GB total), and an unzipped variation (all games are extracted within the zip for convenience, 3.25GB total).<br/></p>\n<p>Most downloads are for Windows.
