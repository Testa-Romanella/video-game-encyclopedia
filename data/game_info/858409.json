Only the first 3 chapters are available, and content is subject to change in the full release.\r\n\n<p><strong>A murder paves way to a reincarnation, a reincarnation</strong><strong> paves way to an uncontrollable bloodlust.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Even for Inhuman standards, Jesse is odd. They can't be classified as any one Inhuman type, and their memories of their past life - their reason for <strong>reincarnation</strong> - are foggy. With nothing but a gut feeling and echoes of a past, Jesse and their two Inhuman friends try to go about their days and find more of Jesse's past life... more importantly, the person who caused this burning hatred inside them.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Please forgive me, for the sins I have tried to forget.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Keronin didn't have much time to think about it. In his<strong> desperation </strong>to get away from the ghosts of his life, he packed up and moved to Paradise. In a place where Inhumans are accepted, he hopes dearly to have a fresh start in a life where he doesn't have to hide himself. But some mistakes can't be escaped.</p>\r\nMain Cast\r\n\r\nJesse\r\n\n<ul><li>Unknown Inhuman type</li><li>Constantly angry at the world</li><li>5'7\"</li><li>They/them</li></ul>\n<p>The newest Inhuman in Paradise. After being violently murdered and reincarnated with no memories of their past, Jesse is trying to find any trace of who they once were - and, by extension, the person who killed them.\u00a0There seems to be a deep resentment within them these days.</p>\r\nKeronin ('Maxwell Cohen')\r\n\n<ul><li>Cubus Inhuman\r\n</li><li>An anxious wreck\r\n</li><li>5'11\"\r\n</li><li>He/him\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>A strange man that recently moved to Paradise a few weeks ago. Casual friends with Torlan, though nothing too friendly. He's always a bit jittery and on edge, and Jesse would like to learn more about him.</p>\r\nTorlan ('Adrian Meyer')\r\n\n<ul><li>Lamia Inhuman</li><li>Overspends a lot</li><li>5'10\"</li><li>He/him</li></ul>\n<p>One of Jesse's two roommates. Torlan considers himself a hot commodity, just for being a male lamia in Paradise. Despite being able to make IDs for Inhumans, he just can't seem to stop spending all his money. He greatly loves his girlfriend, Ayuta.</p>\r\nColeth ('Miles Hoffman')\r\n\n<ul><li>Cubus Inhuman</li><li>Tired of everyone's nonsense</li><li>6'3\"</li><li>He/him</li></ul>\n<p>One of Jesse's two roommates. Coleth is an incubus with a crippling addiction to coffee - in his defense, though, with how ridiculous Jesse and Torlan are, it's no wonder he needs it. Works at the border between harpy and\u00a0<em>jiuweihu</em> territory. He thinks he's the sane one, but he's just as unhinged as his roommates.</p>\n<p>---</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left Click/Spacebar - Advances dialogue</p>\n<p>Right Click/Escape - Pulls up menu</p>\n<p>Shift - Message Backlog</p>\n<p>Make sure to move your cursor over in-game CGs for something special!</p>\r\nPayment\r\n<p>The demo will\u00a0<strong>always be free</strong> and payment is\u00a0<strong>optional</strong>.
