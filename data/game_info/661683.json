The chances are you've never heard of it, but I promise it's quite interesting and unusual. It was my first game made in Elm and I'll make a video about it on my YouTube channel. While the video is not up yet, you might find interesting how I made a nice maze game in just 8.5 minutes:</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cbecd59f4c9777b78c67f1471f1f1a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Igor Konyakhin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
