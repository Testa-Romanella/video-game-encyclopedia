But since their flesh was too far gone, they could only possess their bones of their old bodies, and in the process of reanimating their bones, their bones began to mutate and change in to horrific versions, like right out of a horror movie. <br/></p>\n<p>Game made in Unreal Engine 4<br/></p>\n<p>Game Packages\r\n  </p>\n<p>Epic Game\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Undead Pack\r\n  </li><li>4 IN 1 Modular Research Facil\r\n  </li><li>Paragon: Lt.
