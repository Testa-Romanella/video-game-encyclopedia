You can have up to 6 sets of stock at any time, they are shown on the right.</p><p>In the second phase, move the character to the sell buttons and interact to sell stock. Stocks rise and fall and you want to sell them at their peak if possible. Stocks will also decay (as indicated by the hearts) so if your stock only has a single heart, sell it or lose that investment.</p><p>The third phase is a brief respite. Study the wall to the right to determine which stocks are the best to buy. High value stocks will have greater fluctuations in value, stocks on a downward trend could be risky but profitable investments. Sometimes the stockbrokers will sell a stock at half price, so it's worthwhile to know the value of stocks.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or D-Pad - Move<br/>A, Space, or A on a controller - Buy stock, sell stock<br/>Start or Enter - Pause<br/><br/>Additional Information:<br/>- Stocks will decay after three turns, as indicated by the hearts. sell them before the end of the stock selling phase if they only have one heart or lose your entire investment.<br/>- You cannot lose the game, but you many poor investments could put you in a position where the game is nigh unwinnable.<br/>- You win by making 5000 gold.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>8 bit SFX by Beep Yeah!<br/>8-Bit Music Booster Pack by Bit Bert</p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/>- Gold will spawn in walls on occasion<br/>- Sometimes the UI will show stocks that you already sold</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b2/5b210c38ea1e2c5231cc7a024c838a32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doglessheadgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
