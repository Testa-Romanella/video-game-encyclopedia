Some are cautious, others are focused, and some actively attempt to sabotage other racers! There are four gamemodes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Free Play</strong> - Race any track you want, however you want. You can use cheats, play with a friend, or both if you so desire.</li><li><strong>Grand Prix</strong> - Compete with seven other racers in a four-track race.</li><li><strong>Time Trial</strong> - Race alone and try to get the best time on each track.</li><li><strong>Track Builder</strong> - Build your own tracks and play on them with all of the freedoms of Free Play.</li></ul>\n<p>There are three difficulty settings for races.</p>\n<p>On <strong>Easy </strong>difficulty, the race is slow-paced and no racers exhibit aggressive behavior.\r\nOn <strong>Normal </strong>difficulty, the race is moderately paced and only one racer exhibits aggressive behavior.\r\nOn <strong>Hard </strong>difficulty, the race is fast-paced and both aggressive racers will actively try to sabotage other racers.</p>\n<p><strong>The game is compatible with a gamepad</strong>. You can connect a second gamepad and race with a friend in the splitscreen multiplayer mode!</p>\n<p>You can save <strong>replays</strong> (one for each track) and view them later. Replays are found within the game files here:</p>\r\n\r\nXenon Kart Racing 0.6.0_Data/StreamingAssets/Replays/replay_#.bin\r\n<p>There's also a <strong>cheats terminal </strong>that gives you more control over the game than you should probably have, but it's fun anyways.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any bugs or glitches, please tell me and give specific details of what happened and how to reproduce it!</p>\n<p>Feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:29:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/3880e6a3837c29bf04e39cd3f16fa52a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xenon Neko"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
