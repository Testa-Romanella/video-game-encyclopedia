There aren't enough clerics to go around so everyone wants to join your party.\r\n</p>\n<p>Recruit your party and go into the dungeon trying to **heal them until they inevitably die**. Well the only thing that matters to you is your own life, so don't forget to get out before you die too.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong># Input :</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Everything is playable with the mouse</strong>. For combat you can also use Q/A, W/Z, E and R to cast your spells.\r\n</p>\n<p>You need to select your target by clicking them at the top of the Battle screen.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Context :</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Haven't finished a Ludum dare in a while so I'm glad to be back.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The original plan was to have way more content : Enemies and party members, spells, add items (the code is mostly there). And have multiple dungeons. But that's a scope problem and I can always add more later.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Post Jam changes :\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Guardian angel can now be cast !</li><li>Guild party emty slot only appear with party size</li><li>Quit button disabled in WebGL</li><li>Show Heal and Mana values</li><li>Changed fonts from TMP defaults</li><li>Show dungeon progression</li><li>Dead character can no longer be targetted</li><li>Running away now pauses battle</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for reading and playing</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T12:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5cc411b2f64ff4a318ca46bf15385a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Garazbolg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
