It is currently very simple with only 3 levels. <br/></p>\n<p>I would \u00a0like to thank the awesome team at GamedevTV for the courses and sharing their love of developing games to everyone. I would also like to thank Foxfin for their Super Platformer Asset Pack on steam. It was the best money I have spent of late. Check Foxfins work out, it is awesome. Also check out GamedevTV if you want to learn more about game development! <br/></p>\n<p>This is certainly a work in progress and I intend to improve the game fairly frequently.
