I would be sending pink slip, but no. We uhm.. lost our nightguard and we would like to transfer you to nightshift instead. Are you OK with that?</em></p>\n<p><em>Love, George<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong> Description<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This is a FNAF inspired game, made in less than 15 hours. You try to defend yourself from three animatronics that went NUTS. You can scare two with a repellent, but third one will not give himself so easily, so you have to reboot him when necessary.<br/></p>\n<p><strong> How to play\u00a0 (spoiler)<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Press <strong>&lt;SPACE&gt;</strong> or click on that small computer on the table to switch tab. On tab 1, you can change repellent setting by pressing <strong>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</strong> or clicking on that button. The text written on that button tells you which animatronic are you repelling. You can see the snowman in that door, but Penguin you can't see. You have to use the scanner on the second tab to find where he is. If he is near you, on the cam six, be careful. Once he leaves that cam, you have to immediately switch to the first tab to switch the repellent. You can control the scanner with <strong>&lt;ARROWS&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</strong>. \u00a0And yeah, the third REBOOT tab is against the third animatronic that doesn't have to travel to you thru the building and instead, he is hiding behind that crack in the wall. So reboot him from time to time by pressing <strong>&lt;SHIFT&gt; </strong>on that tab.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>This game is heavily inspired by FNAF from Scott Cawthon. I do not make any money out </strong></em><strong><em>of it and it was made for educational purpose only. Also, it doesn't have save system. Instead, you can choose what night you want. Some story elements will be hidden, though.</em><br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T10:51:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40cfaf2c5edcf361e4146c230f6b32e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lasermtv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
