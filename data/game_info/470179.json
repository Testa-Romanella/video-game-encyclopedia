As the client you decide how he gets through the dungeon. The problem is your map of the dungeon is blank. You have to lead the adventurer blind through the dungeon. As he explores you will learn more of the dungeon, but each time you give new orders his commission goes up. So you want to get as much movement out of each command, but take enough breaks between to get an idea of what you are sending him into. Be careful if you prove to be an ineffective navigator, the adventurer may stop following your commands.<br/></p>\n<p>Each turn you add up to ten commands and the adventure will follow them through. As he moves through you will learn the layout of walls, water, locked gates, etc. Try to find treasure and reach the exit in the least turns possible, because each turn costs gold. The adventure has 4 health, the dungeon has traps and if you lead him into too many he will no longer trust your leadership and may reject a command.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - Add direction to commands</p>\n<p>Space Bar- Order Adventures to execute your commands</p><p>Known Bugs</p><p>Respawning duplicates player - scene management issue, restarting game will resolve</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Ryan Sheeran- Programing</p>\n<p>Brandon Sheeran- Level Design/ Write Up</p>\n<p>Michael Buksar - Music/SFX</p>\n<p>Assets</p>\n<p>\tDungeon Tileset - Raou - https://raou.itch.io/dungeon-tileset-top-down-rpg</p>\n<p>\tKnight Model - CleanCutGames - https://cleancutgames.itch.io/pixelart-fantasy-characters</p>\n<p>Raft Asset from the Original Legend of Zelda</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T07:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f04/f04dec1efef3dc79d94822529b0314e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["QRyguy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
