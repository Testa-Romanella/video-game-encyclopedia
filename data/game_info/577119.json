In the space station, enemies wait to attempt to destroy the player, and they must be avoided or destroyed. The player must collect keys for the doors to advance to the final room where victory awaits.\u00a0 For this game, I created the 3D asteroids, the terrain textures, and wrote scripts to rotate asteroids. I also used the assets from MSU to create unique levels.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:48:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d66/d6699f6ce9217d53f7857c7278800ac3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nichi13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
