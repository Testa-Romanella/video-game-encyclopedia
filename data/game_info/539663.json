You can wall run by touching walls while in the air.\u00a0Mouse to aim, left click to shoot,\u00a0R key to reload, 1 2 and 3 keys switch weapons,\u00a0F key to punch,\u00a0right click to fire rocket, left shift to dash, left control to stop time. Press ESC to go back to main menu.<br/></p>\n<p>Windows, macOS, and Linux builds are available, but I've only tested the Windows one, so if the others are broken, that's probably why.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Also, there are two versions of the game, 0.3 and 0.3.1. Version 0.3.1 has major performance and bug fixes and I\u00a0highly recommend downloading it instead of 0.3. However, it\u00a0also an experimental white color scheme, which is why I've left version 0.3 available, for those that prefer the black and purple and have beefier computers that can handle the performance requirements of that version.</strong></p>\n<p>devlog:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/598cf426e15b6b28d2ab655f8eb2c618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Steven"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
