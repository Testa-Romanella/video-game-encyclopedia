The game has numerous features such as a variety of puzzles some unique to the game with combinations of it; Semi rogue-like levels that give each computer a set of levels that is unique for each one; A smart AI that you can avoid danger but may still be lead to its death; Challenge modes and YOLO mode that can give a more rogue-like experience with a cost of a life; and more to follow.<br/><br/>There is more to the game, as an early access it is still under construction. So please, bare with me as I make more levels and features. Only one person is working on the game with only his free time to work with. Which I am hoping to change.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/88924ab41d6266c191371db4fbf1c5ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 29}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christ Laurenz Sambrano"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Christ Laurenz Sambrano"], "esrb_rating": null}
