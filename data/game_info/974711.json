Destron is, at its heart, a terrorist organization, formerly known as the GELSHOCKER ALLIANCE (a joint organization between SHOCKER and GELDAM), whose objective is the conquest of the world, the destruction of civilization, and the enslavement of mankind.</p>\n<p>Because of what he saw, Kazami was targeted for assassination.

With the words &quot;Rider...Henshin!&quot;, Hongo Takeshi transformed and revealed his true identity - KAMEN RIDER!</p>\n<p>Kazami was now burning for revenge. He pleaded with his mentor to transform him into the cyborg - half human, half grasshopper - freak, the KAMEN RIDER. But the Kamen Riders were reluctant to do so. Being a Kamen Rider meant that one would never experience life as a true mortal man again. The aftermath would be a painful experience...</p>\n<p>As our heroes fought their way into a Destron&#39;s hideout, they suddenly fell into a trap! Under the Anti-Cyborg beams, the hapless Kamen Riders slowly began to disintegrate. From what seemed almost certain doom, Kazami Shiro came to the rescue!
