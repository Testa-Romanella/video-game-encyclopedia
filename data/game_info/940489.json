Adventuring Heros of the Alternate Dimensions", "description": "<p>This is the jam version.\u00a0 If I expand on it, I will link to the full version from here later.\u00a0 Screenshots are from old mid-jam versions,\u00a0but they should give an idea what to expect anyway.</p>\r\nA.H.A.D.\r\nAdventuring Heros of the Alternate Dimensions\r\n<p>AHAD is a first-person dungeon exploration game in which every bit of playable content is as procedurally generated as I can manage.\u00a0 In short, it exists to answer the question \"Does an RPG need to be designed?\"\u00a0 The end result is an exciting button that represents stepping through the veil of reality to find alternate realities full of strange things.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warnings</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Contains fantasy violence\u00a0between cute critters\u00a0in a turn-based dungeon crawler.</li><li>Contains randomized, maze-like dungeons with often narrow passages presented in a first-person view.</li><li>Contains randomized difficulty curves, so expect to die, often, unfairly, and quickly.</li><li>Controls like a FPS when out of combat, may not be accessible to older players looking for traditional dungeon crawl inputs.\u00a0 I'll be looking into adding traditional grid movement later.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>AHAD can be controlled by touching/dragging the virtual sticks, or on PC you can click the 3D view to walk around in a more traditional FPS control scheme with WASD and mouse look.\u00a0 In combat or menus, tap or click the buttons to choose the options.\u00a0 The interface should be mostly self-explanatory.</p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs and issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>CRITICAL WebGL build gets confused about window focus if you play full screen and then go back to windowed mode.\u00a0 I'm not sure how to fix this or what is even going on.\u00a0 Staying in one of those modes while playing appears to work fine.</li><li>CRITICAL WebGL build can be very slow for some reason the first time playing the game and looking around.\u00a0 I suspect it is something to do with the first time the game renders a dungeon prop/enemy model.\u00a0 I don't know where to start solving this, so for now just be patient, it isn't stuck, just really slow!</li><li>CRITICAL Sometimes combat is started when triggering the exit or new floor, when this happens the whole game ends up soft locked in combat.\u00a0 Need to find the cause still, it's buried deep and hard to recreate.\u00a0 For now just make sure to kill everything around the stairway.</li><li>CRITICAL enemy can target dead party members, making their attacks a bit less effective.</li><li>MILD radar does not show anything else besides the layout of the dungeon, this makes it easy to get lost.</li><li>MILD Sometimes the generator can reuse the same species template, resulting in two stat sheets that are the same species but have different rolled stats for combat.\u00a0 This is unintended and will require a better species selection code to fix.</li><li>CRITICAL but rare.\u00a0 On some stupid rare occasion the combat will not free your cursor or sometimes lock it into navigation mode.\u00a0 Use ESC on pc to free the cursor and attempt combat interaction again.\u00a0 There is no fix for mobile and I have no idea why this is happening.\u00a0 I have a \"fix\" patched in but no idea if it works or not because this issue is so random.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Procedural generation so far</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Party species and stats are randomly chosen at the start of each game.</li><li>All combat creatures, including party members, will randomly be assigned a move set pulled from a larger pool of what the universe contains.\u00a0 For now this is not attached to species.</li><li>Party levels up and gains randomized moves as they grow.</li><li>Dungeon floor layout will be generated each new game and each new floor.</li><li>A Database of enemies is built at the game start and expanded on each floor, and enemies are pulled from cloning this list.\u00a0 In short this means lots of enemies are clones of each other to aid in learning each run, but each run will have unique opponents.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Planned, but ended up on the cutting room floor for jam time</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Scoring for combat victories so score is a bit more exciting in general.</li><li>Combat skip turn option to allow players to act out of order until all have acted.\u00a0 This would need a rewrite of how the player turns are calculated.</li><li>More than 1 combat action per creature, especially for party members!\u00a0 Combat is so sad and boring right now.\u00a0 Might consider adding this to leveling or species data, still considering the implementation.</li><li>Name generation, species generation, more generating stuff in general.</li><li>Better UI that explains more to the user about what is going on in the stats/abilities/damages of the game world.</li><li>Different visual effects for each move, to make them unique/pick from a list of spell visual effects.\u00a0 Technically this version has 2 implemented but they look the same.</li><li>Items and equipment, some kind of drop/treasure/item system?</li><li>Scoring, gold found, stuff to do with it.</li><li>Random formulas to use stats to resolve combat attack score.\u00a0 Example: Str * move power, or ((Dex * Str) / 2) * move power.\u00a0 These would be per move created, so the player can learn them.</li><li>Random universal growth rules, like in this universe HPMax is determined by X formula, while in the next Y formula is used instead.\u00a0 These would carry over across the creatures, so a creature from X dimension is still using X formula in the Y dimension.</li><li>Ability to capture enemies to obtain new party members.</li><li>Ability to swap out members before play to customize starting party.\u00a0 This would come with a Guild system for storing and managing the members.</li><li>Random skins for dungeon, so each game looks a bit different.</li><li>Random skin features for dungeon skins, again for variety.</li></ul>", "metacritic":
