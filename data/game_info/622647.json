But you're surrounded by squares. Some are irrelevant. Others are useful and/or annoying. Then there are the black squares. They want you to Retry. They will shoot or even try to touch you. They are the bad guys. Be a good guy and pulverize those baddies, will you?<br/><br/>Survive and shoot all enemies in 200 levels. Each level won unblocks the next level permanently (autosave). Enemies come in a variety of black squares and action patterns, while squares of other colors do a multitude of things, ranging from reflecting bullets to teleporting you. Enemies are vanquished with a single hit, and so do you. Failing a level has no consequences. While the first levels are easy and often, very quick, difficulty increases greatly in later levels.<h3>Game Elements</h3><br/><br/>This is you.
