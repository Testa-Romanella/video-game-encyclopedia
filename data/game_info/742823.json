There's always a damn catch.</p>\n\n<p>The Devil's in the Details is a visual novel about discovery, mystery and how hard you're willing to work, in order to escape Hell. It'll be your job to evaluate contracts from people willing to sell their souls for their deepest desires. Whilst you do this, it'd be wise to build a rapport with not only Lucifer, but your fellow lost souls - who knows what benefits could arise.</p>\n<p><strong>The current version</strong> - 0.1.0 - is quite barebones, but serves as an introduction to the character of Lucifer and Hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Planned Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Contract Mechanics</li><li>Social Stats with each character</li><li>Unlockable Social Events</li><li>Multi-chapter story</li><li>Multiple Endings: Good, Bad and a Secret Ending</li><li>Currency/Monetary System</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Updates -\u00a0</strong>I'm hoping to update the game at least once a month, but this could end up being multiple times a month, with each update at least adding content to the story.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> There is some light swearing in the game, but no NSFW content in addition, at the moment or planned for the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:00:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f953ceb0fc5275059fb248d64c16d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blake Hewitt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
