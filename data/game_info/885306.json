Cubes version 0.4</em></strong><br/>My name is Mike, and I'm a student at a game development university in Norway, currently doing my first year. This project was initially going to be a learning experience for me on how to work in Unity and how to code. As I began working on it, I almost immediately fell in love with making this game, and right now I'm spending all my spare time at this project.\u00a0\u00a0I've got so many ideas and I've already began working on them.<strong><em>Join the Discord Server</em></strong><br/>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/UjN3pBgb<br/>You can get in touch with me and the community by joining the discord server. Everyone is welcome and feel free to share your progress, come with feedback or just lurk around.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong><em>Development<br/></em></strong>I've spent a lot of time and a bit of money into this project, and I plan to continue develop it to become greater. I'll gladly take suggestions and feedback about what you would like into the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Towers VS. Cubes is still <strong>very </strong>rough, and there's a lot missing. The balancing might still be way off, so please keep that in mind if there's any frustration about the game.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong><em>Support me?<br/></em></strong>I want to make this game as good as it can get, and while it's a side project while doing school, I would like to work even more on it, and gradually improve it as much as I possibly can. If you really like the project, please consider donating. It'd help me out so much, and everything will go into the development of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a bonus for donating, I'll give you some rewards depending on the amount you donated. (DM me on the discord if you donate)<strong><br/>$5 or more\u00a0<br/></strong>- A \"Supporter\" Role on the Discord which has access to a channel containing development progress and discussion about the next version of the game.<br/><br/><strong>$20 or more\u00a0</strong><br/>- All Cubes VS. Towers related releases, which means that whenever the full game and future things like DLC, passes or other is launched, you'll be given it for free.\u00a0<br/>- A \"VIP\" Role on the Discord, which has access to a channel where big decisions on the game might take place. This channel will be taken into heavy consideration when I implement new features or balance the game.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>$50 or more\u00a0<br/></strong>- All of the above<br/>- I want to develop games as long as I breathe, this has become my favorite activity to do. I plan to make more games after Cubes VS. Towers, and I'm open for suggestions. If you are so unearthly generous to donate this amount, I'll give you a free copy of ALL my future releases I'll ever make, as well as take your suggestions and feedback into what I can do for my future games. You'll be granted access to a lifetime supporter channel on Discord, and I'd love to talk about everything in there :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T08:36:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4e99aac4c6328551edffced455a3e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MikeNoLife"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
