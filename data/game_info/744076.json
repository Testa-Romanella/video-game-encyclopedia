You can play it here:\u00a0sand.jack.kiwi\u00a0or check out the code on\u00a0GitHub.</p>\n<p>The falling sand game was one of those classic games that everyone played in school. I've spent hours and hours playing similar games and after my experience simulating\u00a0cellular automata\u00a0with\u00a0Pixel Plumber\u00a0I wanted to take the idea further.\r\n</p>\n<p>When I started working on this I hoped to make a hyper-optimised JS implementation of the sand game, but as I was working on it I decided to favour code structure and readability over optimisation. It still manages to run near 60 FPS on my MacBook Pro so I'm pleased with that.\r\n</p>\n<p>The design for the 'device' is heavily inspired by\u00a0neumorphic\u00a0design principles and the\u00a0OP-1 synthesiser by Teenage Engineering.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T06:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96f/96f6ff2790776e29b7a3936a2f9f223a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Cruden"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
