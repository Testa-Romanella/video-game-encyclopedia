Ector don't have any combat abalities and have only 1 HP, so be careful around enemies. Try to complete all the levels to finally reach the... \"end\". (I challenge you to finish the game !)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to:<br/></strong>You need to use the cloud as platform by reversing the gravity (Press X), but be careful, each levels have a limited amount of powers and you can't disable the power while using it. You can see on the top left of your screen how many power you have left. You just need to finish each levels without being damaged once. Oh and remember that you can't be touch by any enemies ! Good luck ! :D <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Musics:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level 1 - 5: https://opengameart.org/users/codemanu</strong><strong>The \"End\": www.soundcloud.com/extenz/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arts</strong>:</p>\n<p>Me, I guess.
