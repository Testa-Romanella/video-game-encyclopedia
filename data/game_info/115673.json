The POLICE and MAINTENANCE CREW are\u00a0 trying to stop the civilians at all cost.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>By default, the game is scanning your face for four basic expressions:\u00a0Happiness, anger, surprise and sadness. The feeling of discomfort of being <em>watched </em>is very much intended, but despite the time limit and general tenseness it is also possible to just have a a casual stroll and\u00a0take in the sights.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>For more information, there is a (German) article about URBAN LEGEND on\u00a0ZEIT ONLINE. <br/><br/>And if you wonder what actual urban legend we're talking about here,\u00a0watch\u00a0this. But be warned, it's about angels &amp; feelings and really strange.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8bd26353d8fe96df48f7e1183745dfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gamecast"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
