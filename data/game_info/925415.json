The player gets 3 lives in a game, and when a zombie damages the player it loses one life. There are coins that are worth 20 points and killing each zombie gives you 5 points. Player can use the spacebar to shoot and arrow-keys to\u00a0move around. It is a competitive shooting game where the goal is to earn as much point as you want until the player dies.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I used different\u00a0triggers, colliders, sounds, visual effects and\u00a0\u00a0made a simple UI in the form of score and health indicators. It is a complete game loop with title and game over screens and\u00a0the player is given the option to play again. Also, there is\u00a0an option to exit normally when the player presses the escape key to exit from full screen.</p><p>Credits Section:</p><p>Sprites -\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Soldier (https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-soldier-sprite-sheets-pixel-art/)</li><li>Zombie (https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-zombie-sprite-sheet-pack-pixel-art/)</li><li>Coin (https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-game-coins-sprite-sheet)</li><li>Heart (https://opengameart.org/content/heart-pixel-art)</li></ul><p>Sounds -</p><ul><li>Background sound (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/orcs-loop-21568/)</li><li>Shooting sound (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/9mm-pistol-shot-6349/)</li><li>Zombie Dead sound (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/breeze-of-blood-122253/)</li><li>Point Collect sound (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/message-incoming-132126/)</li><li>Player Dead sound (https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/zombie-6851/)</li></ul>\n<p>Background Image -</p><ul><li>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/788692953476885743/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447af23b38390d5bd442bea9b5339418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Anik Barua"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
