(Dogma Challenge)", "description": "<p>\r\n\tControls: Hold left arrow or right arrow || &lt;--- or ---&gt;\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGoal: Follow the arrows as they light up to complete the level.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFail: all of your balls get destroyed by running into the dark green \"fail zones\".\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAs part of the final project in Spring 2015 Game Design 1 at Johnson County Community College, we had to design a game that follows the rules of the Dogma 2001 challenge.  It is described fully in the article by Gamasutra linked below.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\thttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131513/dogma...<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAlthough I was one of the few students that adhered to the full dogma rules, I found the rules to significantly favor abstract games rather than games that have any sort of coherent theme or story.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt was a very tough challenge and I'm fairly happy with how it turned out.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis is also the first game that I've called \"Balls!\".  Usually it's more of a descriptor than a title as the only controllable object within the games I make like this are basic primitive spheres... I.E. balls.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA presentation on this prototype can be found on my YouTube channel.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f164675dcf71624056183640c1989295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casey Shreve"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
