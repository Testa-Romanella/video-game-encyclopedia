This mod changes a few things such as right click to throw, shift to block, alt to slow time, new death callouts,\u00a0and no blood particles. (To be kid-friendly and make the game run smoother.) But the major change is if you complete level 10 in under 20 seconds you unlock, a unused asset, a gun! One shot kills, janky aiming, and dual wielding of a gun and a sword is all now possible. Remember, was the gun was cut from the game. To use the gun, pick up a sword powerup.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7c/c7c28fd391e2480b66e936640e3020a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JelyMe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
