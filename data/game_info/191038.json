Every time you correctly get through a doorway, you score a point- rounds are played first to 5 points. There will only be a limited amount of food cropping up so it will be a frantic scramble to get to it first, which you can do by dashing to it by pressing the left or right bumper.</p>\n<p>To ensure more people can play the game with less controllers available, we have mapped 2 players per Xbox controller! One player is the Left Joystick w/ left bumper dash, and the next player is right joystick is right joystick with right bumper to dash. (Same goes for the next controller for players 3 and 4).</p>\n<p>To begin, move Left or Right to select your bunny characters (make sure you know which bunny you are!), and when every player has a bunny selected, press any bumper to start the round!</p>\n<p>Hop to it!</p>\n<p>\"Dream Team\" is: Leora, Michael, Rene, Natalia, and Brian.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n</p>\n<p>P1 -\u00a0Left joystick to move, Left Bumper to Dash\r\n</p>\n<p>P2 - Right Joystick to move, Right Bumper to Dash</p>\n<p>P3 - (Second controller) Left joystick to move, Left bumper to Dash</p>\n<p>P4 - (Second controller) Right joystick to move, Right bumper to Dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b4b7ae485a73a54fe8b28de91c7e308.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aspiring Fires"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
