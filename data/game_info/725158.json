Legend has it - the gummy juiciness of this glorious gelato was so delicioso that it gained sentience! Thus, tons of tiny slimes were born, spreading cheerful colourfulness around the world. They watched us while we worked, adopting some of our mannerisms. The joyful jellies began forming small squishy slime societies, with many of the jubilant gels finding hobbies, acquiring jobs, and fostering friendships.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This brings us to an eensy isolated island in the Southern Peninsula, where one very special slime is about to learn something new for their little community:\r\n</p>\n<p>The secrets to happiness and personal wellbeing.\r\n</p>\n<p>------------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Made for XBCGD7319 2021 as a Final Phase submission by the 3rd-year Vega Durban student 'Game Changers' team.
