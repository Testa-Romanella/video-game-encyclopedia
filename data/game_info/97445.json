See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! </li><li>A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! </li><li>Fight for your dreams on the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! </li><li>Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! </li><li>Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both?</li></ul><p>To sell, or not to sell:</p>The game will be available as a pay-what-you-liked release. <p>\"Pay what you want\"- type models often comes with certain expectations, namely that the games are short, or small scale projects. <br/>In truth, these expectations fail to realistically apply to many projects using this model, and Honey is one of them. <br/></p><p>I don't want to put a retail price on it. The indie standard of 7.99 might give it a breathing chance in a very congested storefront environment, but would be nowhere near representative of the work and time i invested in the project. </p><p>But mostly, what matters to me is that YOU value the experience it will provide, and I hope you will decide to support my work and its continued existence by however much you value it to be. </p><p>In the end, I hate to think of my work as a product I'm selling so that you, as a customer, can consume it - I'd rather our relationship be that of patrons enjoying the work of a craftsman, whose creations you help through monetary support and word of mouth. </p><p>I'll open donations and contribution pages closer to the game release, but before then, you can support my patreon at www.patreon.com/pehesse , or save up your money so it's ready to go when the game will be available to download! </p><p>And I hope, most of all, you will have fun playing this game! </p><p>FAQ:</p>-How far along is the game? <p>The game is currently at about 90% completion. I'm planning two more features for the game - one related to the core experience, the other related to bonus content (it could very well be DLC added after the game's release, but I intend for the initial package to be as complete as possible). There is also script editing, testing, debugging... not a lot compared to what came before, but plenty enough to keep busy! </p><p>-When will it release? </p><p>I don't want to commit to any specific date, even though release is definitely a matter of months, simply because I don't want to create expectations. </p><p>I'm aiming for a Q4 2016 release, and you can trust that I will release the game as soon as it's possible to do so, meaning when I believe it's fully ready! </p><p>-Will it come to early access? </p><p>No. This game has a strong narrative focus, and the script isn't subject to change at this point, meaning playing it now in early access would spoil many of its developments. I also don't believe in early access as a business model, especially in conjunction with the \"pay what you want\" approach.</p><p>However, there have been and will be more testing rounds. If you're interested in participating in testing, please contact me, though with the following caveats: <br/>don't apply for a testing build if you: <br/>-only wish to play through the game <br/>-don't intend to give feedback <br/>-expect a polished and bug free experience <br/>-and/or are frustrated by the prospect of having to restart a save file several times over as I update the test builds! </p><p>This is all so the final game will have none of that, so if you are only interested in the most complete experience possible, please wait until the game's release! </p><p>-Will there be voice acting? </p><p>No. I believe the game is stronger without, as it allows me far greater possibilities for writing the script, tweaking and editing it until the very last stages of development, along with allowing me to write a much bigger number of lines than I could possibly afford to record! </p><p>Additionally, I didn't write these characters with specific voices in mind - I'd much rather you imagine or act out your own! </p><p>Where to find Honey:</p>On her homepage: pehesse.fr/honey <br/>On tumblr: pehesse.tumblr.com <br/>On twitter: @lavantdapres <br/>On TIGSource: forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=42222.0 <br/>On IndieDB: www.indiedb.com/games/honey-rose-underdog-fighter-extraordinaire <p>Questions?
