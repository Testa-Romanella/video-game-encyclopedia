{"id": 797072, "slug": "lost-in-the-stars", "name": "Lost in the Stars", "name_original": "Lost in the Stars", "description": "<p>For the <strong>GDTV Game Jam 2022. </strong>A<strong> </strong>2D space shooter with three levels, upgrade mechanics (unlockable via progression) and lots of big explosions.<strong> <br/></strong></p>\n<p>Your ship is equipped with both forward lasers and a turret which fires towards the mouse pointer.<strong> PS.\u00a0if you don't like 'tank controls' then pressing 'M' will change to more modern controls.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>W</strong>: Forward thrust</li><li><strong>S</strong>: Reverse thrust</li><li><strong>A</strong>: Anticlockwise thrust</li><li><strong>D</strong>: Clockwise thrust</li><li><strong>Left click (or ctrl)</strong>: Fire main lasers</li><li><strong>Right click</strong> <strong>(or space)</strong>: Fire turret</li><li><strong>Shift</strong>: Afterburner</li></ul>\n<p><strong>New - Alternate Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>M</strong>: Toggle between classic movement and easier movement. Easy movement makes WSAD move you towards the cardinal directions. <br/>(note: this is an experimental feature but added so hopefully everyone can enjoy the game without the controls getting in the way)</li></ul>\n<p>Collect minerals from destroying asteroids and foes. Use minerals to upgrade your <strong>guns,</strong> \u00a0<strong>turret </strong>and <strong>ship</strong>'s armour and engine / turning performance.</p>\n<p>Good luck and have fun! I tried to provide a balance between relaxed gameplay with action as frenetic as you want to make it.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Your max upgrade level increases as you progress (phoenix-like from the ashes)</li><li>Blind-firing into the distance will cause enemies to return fire! They won't always chase you, but they will fire back with decent accuracy. Balance aiming and gratuitous laser death spraying :)</li><li>Don't forget the afterburner if things get dicey.</li><li>Tank controls take some getting used to, upgrading your ship can help make you more agile. The modern control option via the 'M' key is also on hand.</li><li>Keep moving!!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Sprites:</p>\n<ul><li>Kenney - for most of the assets</li><li>Vesselforge for customised Kenney stuff</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/sci-fi-effects by Scorpio</li><li>2k_mercury.jpg - planet texture: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/</li><li>2015 Cruiser Bold font - http://www.pixelsagas.com</li></ul>\n<p>Fire &amp; Explosion effects:</p>\n<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/unity-particle-pack...</li><li>\"Tower Defence Basic Towers\" by Nido licensed CC0: https://opengameart.org/node/114170</li><li>\"barrier - sprite sheet\" by gfroad licensed CC0: https://opengameart.org/content/barrier-sprite-sheet</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<ul><li>Space Ambience &amp; Chronos by Alexander Nakarada: https://freepd.com/electronic.php</li><li>Goodnightmare by Kevin MacLeod: https://freepd.com/electronic.php</li><li>Think About it &amp; Go On Without Me by Bryan Teoh: https://freepd.com/epic.php</li></ul>\n<p>Backgrounds:</p>\n<ul><li>https://opengameart.org/content/vortex-background by darkrose</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/weg-art-background-space by vladart</li></ul>\n<p>Everything else was made by myself, let me know if I missed anything!
