You, a little frog named frog, have to jump and dodge out of their way.\u00a0Set them up in lines (Tetris style) in order to clear them off of your land.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>-Pull them with your tongue while they're green and\u00a0falling.</p>\n<p>-Turn them into dust once they're dry, yellow, and\u00a0set on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Just be careful using that tongue of yours. Getting squished is easier than you think.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>-Raise your acrobatics game by upgrading your jump height and tongue length every time you clear 3 lines.</p>\n<p>-Collect all the eyes and uncover the mystery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-But most of all we hope you have fun!</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Pullfrog is a\u00a0game created by Joven Paul and Mario Carballo. Made in Pico8 over the month of June 2020. We had a ton of fun making it and we learned a lot. If you have any feedback about it, feel free to let us know! We want to balance it just right so all kinds of players can enjoy it.</p>\n<p>-Thanks for playing\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:45:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/462cf3362ca6a94e6bfab8b678660895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["AFK", "Joven Paul"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
