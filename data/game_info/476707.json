The reason for this is because this is not my actual demo. It has no cutscenes or lore bits anywhere so even though you guys know some of the lore, a newcomer would have no idea what's going on. I really just made this demo beta so you guys can have a hand at the controls of the game and get a feel for it. I am still working on the demo and having you guys test run the demo beta is really helpful so i don't have these issues when making the actual demo of the game.</p><p>NEW PLAYER DISCLAIMER: This game is still in a very early stage of development. There is a story to go along with it but the beta that you are able to play is just a way that i can let some people do bug and glitch test and get a feel for the controls of the game. You can still play it and look for bugs and glitches yourself but don't except too much of the game at the current moment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:41:04", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThePlutonicWolf"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
