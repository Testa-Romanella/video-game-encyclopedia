Wealth, power, the adoration of millions, and\u2026 secrets to protect. This weekend he has gathered his family to discuss his running for presidency of the United States. Lust, revenge and betrayal are all at play in this political thriller.<br/><br/>So do you just watch? Or\u2026 will you risk getting involved? Will the videotape you make save the country? Or might it cost you your life?<br/><br/>As the voyeur, it\u2019s all up to you.<br/><br/><strong>* * *</strong><br/><br/>Voyeur was first released on the Phillips CD-i back in 1993 and was one of the first big-budget games to take advantage of the console\u2019s FMV \u2013 that\u2019s full-motion-video \u2013 capabilities. Whereas today we are used to full-screen video in resolutions of 4K or more, the inclusion of \u2018real-life\u2019 filmed content within the context of the game was considered a huge step forward\u2026 and Voyeur was leading the way.<br/><br/>It wasn\u2019t only the game\u2019s technical capabilities that made headlines, however. The ostensibly \u201cadult\u201d content \u2013 in fact pretty tame in reality \u2013 led to Voyeur joining the Leisure Suit Larry series and Digital Pictures\u2019 Night Trap (among others) in an exclusive club of games which stirred up controversy to such a level that the media \u2013 acting as society\u2019s moral guardians \u2013 called for them to be banned.<br/><br/>In Voyeur, you take on the role of a private investigator hired to collect evidence of wealthy CEO Reed Hawke\u2019s corruption by a member of his family. To keep the game fresh over multiple plays (with multiple endings, again a mechanic well ahead of its time) the family member is chosen at random from those that Reed has gathered together in order to announce his bid for the country\u2019s presidency. Taking control of a video camera located in a building opposite the family\u2019s mansion, your goal is to collect enough video evidence to destroy the would-be-president\u2019s career. You might want to include some danger money in your quote for the weekend though, as if you come to the wrong conclusion after compiling your evidence, you will end up victim of a ruthless assassin!<br/><br/>Interestingly, the game\u2019s design was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window, with the player initially only able to see partial scenes. If they make the wrong decision about where their focus should be, their sense of context for other material may be tainted. More so that any other game before it, Voyeur elevated FMV above the level of a gimmick and made it an integral part of the gameplay. Critically acclaimed for its originality and the quality of the acting \u2013 previous efforts had been hopelessly amateur \u2013 Voyeur rightly takes its place among a small number of games that were both highly controversial and great fun to play!<br/><br/>You too can close the blinds, draw the curtains and hone your skills as a top private dick by keeping a close \u2013 a very close \u2013 eye on the Hawke family, becoming the ultimate\u2026 voyeur.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfb/cfb404df97f391140a737d54a9124eb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Philips P.O.V.
