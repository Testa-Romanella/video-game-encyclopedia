The game caused a lot of controversy for its violent scenes.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>A death sentenced convict James awakens in Carcer City after his supposed execution by lethal injection. The protagonist finds himself equipped with an earpiece, in which he hears the voice of The Director. The Director offers James freedom in turn for helping The Director shoot his violent TV show. It is said that a gang called The Hoods is patrolling the neighborhood killing everyone they spot. James has to survive the night in Carcer City in order to get his freedom.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players have to traverse multiple locations to complete a specific list of tasks. These tasks come down to getting somewhere, murdering a gang member, and finding items. </p>\n<p>There is a group of special enemies called The Hunters which run to the players as soon as they are spotted. The game features an advanced stealth system. The players can be hidden in the shadows, yet if they step on something, a noise will be made, which can attract The Hunters.</p>\n<p>There are two ways of executing an enemy - a direct confrontation or a stealth kill. It is much harder to kill an enemy using the first way, as the game encourages the players to use stealth kills. These stealth kills are often referred to as Executions. There are three types of executions, with each one varying in their speed and violence.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2003-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T21:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c23/c23b578d6a9dd1c73ee403157184e793.jpg", "website": "http://www.rockstargames.com/manhunt", "rating": 3.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 112, "owned": 1301, "beaten": 260, "toplay": 76, "dropped": 155, "playing": 16}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 331, "suggestions_count": 565, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 331, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Rockstar North", "Rockstar Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
