He utilized the trompe l'oeil effect, the Oculus, and cinematic painted imaging on the walls, to reveal a world of fictional and symbolic situations combined with classical mythology. However, Andrea Mantegna playfully organized these compositional components, inaugurating a proto-technological system of visualization that transforms the viewer's perception in an immersive experience that goes beyond the mere effect of illusion. The research and the development of the installation \u201cThe Most Beautiful Room in the World\u201d describes and explains through cinematic and interactive/immersive experiences what Mantegna expressed masterfully at the end of the 15th century in the Saint Giorgio Castle in Mantua, Italy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T09:51:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/445e8c7845376cf7fb1cc9b6342cd55e.jpg", "website": "http://www.andresmontenegro.com/NewWebsite/creative/weddingchamber.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andres Montenegro"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["Pinichanchi Animation"], "esrb_rating": null}
