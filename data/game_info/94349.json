Your main tool to achieve your mission is a magic torch which you use to illuminate your path, defend from evil spirits and solve puzzles.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br/><em>This is not an RPG, this is not Roguelike, this is not a game with procedurally generated maps - this is a Storyline adventure game which includes puzzles, action and exploration. All the maps are carefully crafted to produce the most enjoyable experience for a player.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Please note 2:</strong><br/><em>Early Access means that the game as it is can not be finished since last map content is missing and may include bugs. Your profile progress may also get lost due to bigger change on the final release due to positive changes. As a developer I promise, that I will do my best to provide you an amazing game, worth of your penny once it is finally released.</em></p>\n\r\n\r\nEarly Access:\r\n<p>\r\n\tI've been developing Courier of the Crypts in my free time for a while now. Since I'm the solo developer on the project apart from the composer, things takes time and money. With Early Access I want to put more time in the development of the game and less time into freelancing. With your help through suggestions and bug reports I will work through until the game is finished.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</strong></p>\n<p><em>\u201cGame will be released as a final version when all the content gets done and bugs fixed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><strong>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Current version contains:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 Storyline maps </li>\n<li>First 13 gameplay maps </li><li>X secret maps</li>\n<li>Profile system </li><li>Crypt Shop (upgrades)</li>\n<li>Map perfection system </li>\n<li>Full controller support</li>\n<li>Arachnophobic filter (if you're afraid of spiders)</li><li>Achievements (Steam only)</li><li>Xbox controller support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can already spend quite some time in the game, especially if you're after all the secrets and relics.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\"The game is featuring somewhat linear story progression through the crypt maps and for that I'll be releasing new maps in order.
