After theme announce in Friday I was worried, that I will end up with nothing at all. And there it is - character is moving, doing something, there is some messages, collisions, assets, a buggy and unclear freezing system ;)\u00a0. I did something I was scary of because of unknown scale - video game. I'm not sure if I could do this in few days with Unity. So thank you Godot, thank you very much :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31a/31a5dbb1b8e8b7d01ec90f30b95ac02b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["SilentManifesto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
