They found that only by manufacturing and upgrading various towers could they deal with the invading monsters. These towers were made of a combination of high technology and magic, and could shoot various types of weapons and spells, such as rockets and magic lightning.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach person had their own responsibilities and tasks. Some people manufactured towers, some researched magic, some managed resources, and some fought. They worked closely together, constantly improving the ability and efficiency of the towers, while also upgrading their own skills to better deal with the increasingly powerful monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs time passed, humans gradually mastered the skills to deal with the monsters. However, just when they felt victory was within reach, the monsters became even stronger and more cunning, keeping humans in a state of constant challenge and progress.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter years of battle, humans finally defeated the invading monsters and achieved victory. However, they also realized that maintaining ecological balance and protecting this beautiful planet was the true challenge. They decided to continue to work hard and strive for a better future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can build towers, upgrade towers, delete towers,<br/>\r\nLAN connection, multiplayer collaboration, battle,ect.<br/>\r\nMonsters will appear in waves within the specified time.
