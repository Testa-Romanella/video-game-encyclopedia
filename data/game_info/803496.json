Pick up items by clicking on them and place down items by clicking on a counter while holding an item. To make an order, place\u00a0the meat on the stove\u00a0and when the meat is cooked well, put\u00a0it on a plate that has already has a bottom bun on it. Make sure to add the top bun! Place the burger, plate and all,\u00a0on the takeout counter and a customer should come and pick it up.\u00a0Every time a customer leaves the restaurant, they get a bit crazier. Soon you will not only have to cook food, but also\u00a0keep your\u00a0customers in line as they go crazy.<br/></p>\n<p>Press the Esc key to quit the game.</p>\n<p>Warning: This is an early prototype. This game is nowhere near completion. This prototype is based around the crazy customers, as that part is the most experimental mechanic.\u00a0We want your feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T16:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d298f88c57c7eb14120d832d9f945e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zaleyact"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
