As of the result: The classic NES \"Battle City\" game with steroids. Realistic controls of the tank. Shooting in any direction. Tricky enemies. 15 maps and a level editor. Perhaps, the difficulty is too high. Hidden bonuses will make the game more diverse.</p>\n<p>==================<br/>### Bonus list ###<br/>==================</p>\n<p>Helmet: An immortality for 30 seconds.
