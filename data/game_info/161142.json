Therefore I made this game for you to experience the pain I feel. During the night, you can memorize everybody's name, during the day, you need to <strong>accept the quest</strong> from different people, and then <strong>deliver the quest</strong> on the specific day just like your messy schedule.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMusic takes from Duke Ellington - Take the -A- Train\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cecf340f5133ab902426db3d9c9c8211.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Erenyx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
