You have to fight your way through corrupted enemies with your trusty weapon \u201cKusarigama\u201d, to find a way to heal said corruption.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On this project I worked together with\u00a0 \u00a0Stephanie Dietzel.</p>\n<p>The focus of the game is the combat system. At first, you can only defend yourself against the animals that have mutated into monsters with close combat attacks. You can perform a combination of attacks and in the later course of the game you also get the possibility to defeat your opponents with ranged and area attacks. The controls are based on other titles of the genre, in which you can target your opponents and evade their attacks.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to first get all the improvements of your weapon to get the full potential out of the combat system and to be able to face the dangers of the game world better. You also need to find the six key fragments in the game world to get to the healing source and cure the plague.</p>\n<p>Link:\u00a0 \u00a0GitHub\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(source code)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/9931d6425dfad661886f8f97fa17dae3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["krtzgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
