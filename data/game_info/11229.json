Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts.<br/>Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own.<br/>The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use.<br/>Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus.<br/>The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational.<br/><br/>There is plenty more to keep you on your toes.<br/>Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion.<br/>Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere.<br/>There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries.<br/>Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput.<br/>Cargo stores can sure come in handy.<br/>What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry.<br/>... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints?<br/><br/>Complete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements.<br/><br/>LOGistICAL's base game covers the whole of Australia including all the major cities, towns and industries.
