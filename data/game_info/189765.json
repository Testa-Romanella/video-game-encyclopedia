In order to succeed you must over come deadly terrain, relentless lava imps, and deadly bosses. Armed with nothing more than a ranged sword, and insane jumping skills, you must, against all odds, kill both gods of hell. Warrior Bob 2 features the unforgiving terrain of hell, tumultuous ambience, terrifying platforming, and relentless enemies. Warrior Bob 2 is, simply put, the most unforgiving, challenging, and addictive, first person indie platforming hack 'n' slash game ever created.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11e/11e1dac1bd936e94d4c0284dcd2434c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Baxternet2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
