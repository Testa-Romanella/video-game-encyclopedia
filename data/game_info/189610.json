And to be honest I made it on the very last day in a few hours. So it's pretty rushed, and kinda short.\u00a0 But nonetheless there are five different endings to the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first ever Game Jam as well as the first time I have ever finished a \"game\". So it was a lot of stressful fun to be a part of this. I hope you guys at least get a laugh out of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cf/2cf94435a95b396f1351f571db8f7205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Harbinger_CR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
