Colin, Andrew, and Cameron are college students studying Computer Science and have interests in game development, and used this event to put those interests to the test. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is a dark, fantasy first-person puzzle game where the adventurer (you) comes across what seems to be a magical staff. Taking the staff seems to give our adventurer more power than they've ever had access to, but at what cost? <br/></p>\n<p>This game is made with the Unreal Engine (our first real experience with this engine, all of us coming from Unity). We had a blast putting this project together and are so satisfied with how it came out. Give it a try and let us know what you think!! <br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our file size ended up being quite big due to the quality of our assets (Thanks Unreal), so we had to upload the game to Google Drive to handle the 2.5ish gig zip (3.8ish gig distribution). Sorry about this and we still hope you check it out!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd3593c81a60d6c480ca10dba754164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Colin Sanders", "Andrew Sylvester", "Cameron Meyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
