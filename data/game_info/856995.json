In this game you are a hexagon constantly moving forward and towards where your mouse is pointing, you can also; shoot, pick up supplies, dash and survive as long as you can. Yes, in fact this is a casual arcade game, but it is also competitive, giving you a timer at the top of the screen and challenging you to survive as long as you can. Of course, you can adjust the enemy spawn-rate in the Options menu.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/327/32756427ec126099b08c7822b47b7aac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CopperToothDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
