A short arcade-like experience with the goal of beating your fastest time in each level. Flex your puzzle-solving and speedrunning abilities as you forge the best path to the exit door.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Death doesn't scare you. It energizes you. Phase through anything that would normally kill you and gain an extra mid-air dash.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Experiment - there's always another solution, but it may not be obvious. Cut around the unphaseable acid spikes? Wall jump first for a good angle to chain together dashes? Reposition an enemy for an ideal route?<br/><br/><br/><br/>No hints. Just your brain, your controller, and the ability to phase dash. Will you rise to the challenge?<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Phase dash</strong> - Walls and platforms can no longer stop you. Choose how to utilize your dash to make it to the end.<br/></li><li><strong>Dangerous speed</strong> - Phasing through an enemy or dangerous object grants you an extra mid-air dash. Chain together dashes to avoid death and blaze past barriers.<br/></li><li><strong>Tricky navigation</strong> - Disappearing dash platforms, hovering ghosts, directional push arrows, and more will lay between you and the exit. Observe, learn, and experiment. Think carefully how to maneuver through the levels.<br/></li><li><strong>Level timer</strong> - The timer saves the fastest time you've achieved on each level. There is no online leaderboard. The focus is on you to figure out the fastest route and improve on your best time!<br/></li><li><strong>Level ranks</strong> - Aim for the S, A, B, or C rank on a level based on completion time! Speedrunners can hunt for the S rank times or even the secret Z rank times.<br/></li><li><strong>Customization</strong> - Remappable controls (for controller and keyboard), screenshake disable, and shadow removal allow you to enjoy the experience your way.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198590/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T03:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d52/d52754f4a7e21619a4cfa565430c80e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Two Slash Nine Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Two Slash Nine Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
