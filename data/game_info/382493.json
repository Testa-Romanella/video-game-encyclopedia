It's a platformer with minimalistic graphics and 8-bit music. You start with no abilities, then gain them gradually. There is an enemy that bombs you from the sky, you need to defeat it. You can see the game as a metaphor for defeating our problems when we had nothing at the start.<br/><br/>The main idea (escaping from bombard) is the same with my earlier prototype, Escape From Bombard. I didn't use any old code from Escape From Bombard, though, all game code is written from the start. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong><br/>Design &amp; Programming: Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX: \u00d6zg\u00fcr Kahraman<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/82312627ae90d86b1f6766d6ec28fcfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
