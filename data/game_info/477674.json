Surguts are intelligent beings who live on one planet in another galaxy\u00a0<br/>\u00a0(3 billion light years away from the Sun). They used to live in small communities, and over time, their unified state appeared.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0They never had wars,\u00a0so other races living in the same galaxy (which Surgut did not know about) dubbed this planet a special status,\u00a0<br/>\u00a0placed guard ships at the entrance to the star system of Surgut and protected this system from external wars and other influences.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Surgut distinguishes only shades of gray, and from that they see the world in black and white. But unlike vision,<br/>\u00a0their hearing is very developed and has a very large range.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here, one Surgut went to study his native island. After a tedious journey,\u00a0<br/>\u00a0he is supposed to return to his home. But he also has one unfinished case -\u00a0<br/>\u00a0local scientists have invented a device that can expand the range of visible colors.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0Our Surgut could not ignore this in any way. The game begins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/31274382f548e0bc62817d37e44f3256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NUNGSNAIL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
