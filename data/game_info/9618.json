Purchase this only if you wish to participate in DoN's EA journey with your feedback/suggestions for the game's long-term growth.<br/><br/>Drunk On Nectar is a Nature Sandbox game about animals, plants and ecology. Multiple game-modes allow you to either play as a creature yourself, simulate ecosystems or create scenarios of your own.<br/><br/>DoN aims to provide the most comprehensive nature experience gaming has ever seen. To this end, the game has been built at invertebrate-scale (a micro world) for an unprecedented level of detail. Plants in DoN are not flat props but living, growing entities that flower, pollinate and propagate across seasons like real plants. Finally, each species has unique gameplay depending on its morphology.<br/><br/>The current release features eight invertebrate species: The Monarch Butterfly (will full lifecycle from Caterpillar to adult!), Jumping Spider (Phidippus Regius), The Ladybug Beetle, Dragonfly (Common Hawker), Ants &amp; Mealybugs (mutualism), Butterfly (Viceroy), and a Bee (Solitary). Plants are first-class citizens in DoN and expected to play an increasingly important role over time.<br/><br/>Additional species of animals, plants and ecological phenomena are planned for addition once the game's EA goals (read above) have been met. You are welcome to vote for a creature or plant you're excited about for addition in the community forums!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d414a7323eea2510f74dc30f1166a79.jpg", "website": "http://www.drunkonnectar.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 12}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 383, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Venugopalan Sreedharan"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Venugopalan Sreedharan"], "esrb_rating": null}
