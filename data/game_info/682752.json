Each quadrant is a different color. The quadrants rotate clockwise/counterclockwise when you move left/right.</p>\n<p>Smaller blocks of the same four colors slowly fall from above. If any of these small blocks become adjacent to a matching color on the player character, then they are consumed.</p>\n<p>Each block consumed awards points and raises the combo. The combo resets to zero after one second without consuming a block. While maintaining the combo, each successive block consumed, awards one more point than the last (+1, +2, +3, +4, etc).</p>\n<p>The game is over if the player is crushed by a block or if they fall off the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>The top option from the title screen starts endless mode. Try to survive and get as high a score as possible.</p>\n<p>The bottom option from the title screen leads to the puzzle menu. From there, various puzzles can be chosen. The goal of each puzzle is to consume every colored block without falling or getting crushed.</p>\n<p>Tip:\u00a0The quadrants on the player character rotate 90 degrees whether moving one space at a time or two spaces at a time. Because of this property the player can adjust the rotation of their quadrants in relation to the surrounding blocks. Two space movement may have other applications as well...<br/></p>\n<p>-----Puzzle Categories-----</p>\n<p>Each quadrant of puzzles in the puzzle select screen have a different theme. The upper left quadrant contains static puzzles that allow you to take your time. The upper right quadrant of puzzles have moving parts and\u00a0require quick thinking.
