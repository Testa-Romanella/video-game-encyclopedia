Evoke the memories of things which never existed and plan something that\u2019s never gonna happen. Reflect when you don\u2019t need to. Then look inside yourself and try not to cry.<br/><br/>Just relax and talk to yourself, looking at the professor\u2019s room or trying to perceive the silhouettes in the white emptiness. Listen to the music. Ask yourself questions and give answers to them. This game is not about victory or failure, fast response or precision, achievements or research. Just in some way.
