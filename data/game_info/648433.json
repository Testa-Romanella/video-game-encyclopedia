When someone experiences a variety of symptoms related to their mental health that might escalate to certain levels, their Mind OS\u00a0would 'reboot' and an Recovery AI executes, aiding them through various ways reducing stress and anxiety\u00a0in the program, till the user felt ready to return to the present.</p>\n<p>As a practical tool for now, this prototype features rooms showcasing breathing exercises\u00a0and meditation methods that can be used for self care using visualisation techniques and positive affirmations.\u00a0The tool can be developed even further to include extended versions of these methods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Aimed at our\u00a0BIPOC &amp; LGBTQ+ communities\u00a0\u00a0who may not have anyone to talk to, or help regarding mental health for various reasons such. We take our health and tech into our own hands, creating virtual places for ourselves online\u00a0where we can flourish.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Inspired by vintage operating systems\u00a0and vaporwave aesthetics.</p>\n<p>Like my work?
