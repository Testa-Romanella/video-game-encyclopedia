Japan\u2019s surrender announcement via the radio was unclear to most Koreans at the time as it used very vague, formal wording. Thus, it was not until the next day or even later that word was spread of their own freedom. The video game, in the form of a visual novel, follows the protagonist as they gather clues after hearing the broadcast in order to reveal what changes it would bring in their country. Following a linear story incorporating a few player choices, the player gets to experience what it felt like to live in Korea when it was a Japanese colony. Through the narrative and the characters presented, they learn how the country gained their independence and how it was a big triumph, a truly monumental day celebrated and remembered by the nation every year, to this day.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Disciplines integrated: Linear Algebra, History, Digital Art</p>\n\n<p>Bibliography</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T09:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91caffd31ea3390a0c300ba59b21ff6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tayareum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
