With your trusty Extendo-Rapier, the main course is the popular Sword and Box magic trick. Alas, there is one problem... You don't actually know how to do magic tricks! But the show must go on. Can you learn to do it on the job?</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In Magician's Skewer, you play as the Magician. Use your Rapier to stab the magic box, but beware, your assistants are inside! Clear a stage by stabbing all the Rapiers all the way through the box from any directions.</p>\n<p>To do so, there are a few tricks that can help you, such as...<br/></p>\r\nAssistant cry\r\n<p>If you hit an assistant, they will cry out to let you know where you hit them. Use it to guide your sword in the right place and clear the stage.</p>\n\r\nAssistant's silhouette\r\n<p>To the left of the screen, you can see the silhouette of your assistants. This will surely help you figure out in what pose your assistants are hiding inside the box.</p>\r\nFreeloading rascals\r\n<p>Occasionally, wild goblin thieves will jump in and hide in your magic box! If you hit them with your Rapiers you will get a bonus!</p>\n<p>Just like the assistants, the goblins' silhouette are displayed for your convenience, but this time on the right side of the screen.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\nStarting the game\r\n<p>The title screen doesn't have a \"New Game\" button...? Don't panic, this is an intended artistic decision.</p>\r\nGame controls\r\n<p>Once you are in the game, click one of the arrow indicators on the box to stab the box.</p>\r\nUpcoming Feature\r\n<br/>\n<br/>Credits\r\nSpiralhalo\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Game Design \r\n</li><li>Mockups &amp; UI Assets \r\n</li><li>Assets\u00a0Implementation \r\n</li></ul>\r\nBluilisht\r\n<ul><li>Game Design\r\n</li><li>Product Direction\r\n</li><li>Programming</li></ul>\r\nLazcht\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>Art &amp; Audio Direction\r\n</li><li>Character Design &amp;\u00a0Assets\r\n</li><li>Audio Engineering (Hunt,\u00a0Mix,\u00a0EQ)\r\n</li></ul>\r\nRoyalty-free Assets Credits\r\n<ul><li>BGM -\u00a0peritune.com\u00a0(Spooktacular, Jingle Halloween 4, 5)\r\n</li><li>SFX -\u00a0\u00a0peritune.com,\u00a0freesound.org\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>yummie, lemonjolly, reidmangan, panxozerok, lucish, wearefreesfx, nekoninja, syna-max, krizin, matrixxx, tim-kahn, eben-frostey, td6d, bravefrog, debgsound, misstickcle</p>\n<em>Thank you for playing!!</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T15:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a16a68dd542c2aab91133075b358b0d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bluilisht", "spiralhalo", "lazcht"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
