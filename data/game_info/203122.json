There are 19 of the yellow things, but you only need 18 to win. Surely not the mistake of someone who didn't care to fix it.<br/></p>\n<p>You can control this game with the arrow keys or WASD. If both is not an option for some reason, you can also use 1234.</p>\n<p>If you don't like the music, you can mute (and unmute) it with M.</p>\n<p>Also, during development i lost a significant amount of progress due to careless overwriting of the map data, so I had to recreate the entire map. Can you find the ghost of the old one still lingering around?<br/></p>\n<p>This game was created for FEMICOM Game Jam #4: Make cute PONG!, and is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85b/85b0a31f4cd2e3106422835d77453395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["earth-rabbit"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
