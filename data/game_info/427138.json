Make sure your cuts are balanced, as splitting a lantern exactly in half gives you more height. Travel as high as possible and compete for the high score!<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING GAME CRASHES </strong>I have a separate download that generates a crash log file. I'll update the main executable once the jam rating period is over!</p>\n<p>One known bug is that <strong>typing F during the \"enter name\" prompt crashes the game.</strong> This is from a bit of leftover code I used for troubleshooting and forgot to remove. Woo, game jam code! The above alternate download also fixes this error.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for the ScoreSpace Jam #8. All graphics, music, sound effects, and game development was done by me within the time of the jam. You can view this game's source code on my Github<br/></p>\n<p><strong>This game used Python prototyping libraries</strong> I developed for past projects. These include: PySprocket, a tool for quick networking and Pyracy, a tool for particle effects and sprite management. It also uses PyGame, a third-party graphics library for Python.<br/></p>\n<p>I used Sibelius, Audacity, and SFXR for audio. You can listen to the soundtrack on my Soundcloud. I used Paint.NET for making graphics. I used a Ngrok tunnel and a Raspberry Pi for the high-score server (I'm not kidding).<br/></p>\n<p>Speaking of which,<strong> this game has an online high-score leaderboard. </strong>I'll be maintaining it for the two weeks following 4/6/20, but no guarantees after that. If something is awry, put a comment below and I'll try to fix it.</p>\n<p>This game is dedicated to the great Mark Somerville, whom I owe a game.
