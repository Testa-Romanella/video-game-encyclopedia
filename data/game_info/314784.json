It's really glitchy becous we wasted a lot of time on a one bug that could have been solved in 3 minutes. Only 5 levels becouse of this.</p>\n\n<p>A D - move</p>\n<p>W/Space - jump</p><p>X - Speed Powerup [if bought]</p><p>C - Jump Powerup [if bought]</p>\n\n<p>In game you have two stats:</p>\n<p>Your Lifecoins [top left] and your Resistance [top left]. When your resistance ends you need to retry the level. When you run out of lifecoins you need to start over the whole game.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>Somewhere in Russia, 3019...\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the Moscow State University something unbelievable has happened. The university's antennas recieved a reply from an other civilization to the Arecibo message sent in 1974.<br/>Aliens sent us a codec to communicate quickly [in just one month]. Unortunally, the codec was recieved uncorrectly and the University's reply instead of saying ,,What planet\" said ,,War planet\". The next day when people realised their mistake a flood happened. The codec was saved on intelligent robo-cards which aren't water proof. Three copies were made and you are the last robocard left now. When you escaped the university you realised that the air was so wet that it was damaging you.You need to get to the Emergency Facility as quick as you can, so they can send a corrected message.</p>\n<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>\n<p>We're two friends working together with @samgus [ @bajtix 's dad ] on a game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>- @bajtix - programming, art, story, idea, levels<br/>- @snajper-1212 - art<br/>- @samgus - level design<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb281b61894bf021f21ea8def4e7e0f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bajtix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
