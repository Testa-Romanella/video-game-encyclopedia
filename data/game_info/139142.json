Pressing up accelerates your ship in the direction it is facing; pressing down accelerates your ship in the direction opposite the way it is facing. Left and right spin the ship, but do not alter your velocity. Spacebar shoots. The player and enemies wrap around the sides of the level.</p><p>Enemies appear from the sides in each level. When you destroy all enemies, you move to the next level. Depending on the difficulty selected, some enemies will drop powerups that give you better/faster weapons, more shields, or extra lives. You can collect powerups by colliding with them or by shooting them with the ship's main laser. (Missiles do not collect powerups.) Missiles can be destroyed with laser shots, but laser shots cannot be stopped.</p><p>Code for this game is available on GitHub:</p><p>https://github.com/fazjaxton/SpaceShooter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba872d669db79eaa36ced6a980c1709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["FazJaxton"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
