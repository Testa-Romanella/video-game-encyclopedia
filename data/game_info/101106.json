They do not depend of each other and can be downloaded separatelly.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMy Home Unity Game is this game, full.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEldamar The Hamster Unity Game is the level \"In your memory\" only, without menu.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEldamar The Hamster Android Game  is an apk you can install in your android device, and it is a smaller version of the \"In your memory\" level, specifically made for android. I've been wanting to do a Unity apk for android since I began with this program and although I haven't been able to convert a normal project into android because the computer limitations, I just made this smaller version in memory of Eldamar, and now I've finally done what I wanted. The controls for that are very simple, it uses the touch screen. In the rar there is an image to guide you about the controls in case you need help. For some reason, I've tested it and playing vertically it works perfect, but playing horizontally it bugs sometimes when you want to walk forward. I have no idea about why this happens but I think it's okay since it's not a big thing.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFinal Words\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI guess this will be my last game created with Unity. I don't know about the future, but it was hard to do and a bit desperating because the computer I used, although it is not bad, it is not enough for Unity. These levels have many gameobjects because the buildings. Even so, it has been a good experience, mostly talking about having the game finally done, and also having in mind the experimentation I've done with the soundtrack. I think it is a good way to say goodbye to Unity.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCredits\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t3D models: http://www.sweethome3d.com/freeModels.jsp\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPet Cage: zf1-mitchell\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTextures: Honey Icechant, VonGklugelstein Alter (SecondLife)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPainters: Ron Miller, Erika McGinnis, Chad Glass, Corina Chirila, Ed Hengeveld, Snake Jagger, Deneb Arici\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSound effects: MaderaDelEste Films, MadamVicious, Caculo, Lizanejordaan\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSpecial thanks to Raquel \u2665\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn your memory, Eldamar\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Buy the Soundtrack</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90b925950c876f113d9b1c4f5d7c3a2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fegefeueranilmathiel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
