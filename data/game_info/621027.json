Then grab the logs and stick them in the holes around the perimeter to make a fence.\u00a0 The fox will attack you, but it can't hurt you, so take it easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n<p>I thought it fit the theme of \"Joined Together\" because 1. it is multiplayer, and 2. The chickens are joining forces to defend their land.\u00a0I bit off more than I could chew and the game is incomplete. You can call it Chicken (Coe-Ahp) or (Coo-P), I won't be mad.</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>4.
