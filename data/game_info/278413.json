In this game jam, you had to make a game in one week based around the theme announced when the game jam starts. For this week, the theme was \"electricity.\"<br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Walter, the player, recently got a new job! This job involved putting down new electricity posts along a very straight road. To Walter, this seemed very tedious and time consuming. So, instead of doing his job the way he's supposed to do it, it chooses to stand on the back of his truck while his coworker is driving to throw the posts like javelins into the group.<br/></p>\n<p>Your job is to put as many posts into the group as possibly without hitting a rock with one or not having it up right. Otherwise, Walter gets fired, or game over! As the game progresses, the truck goes faster, Walter must throw the posts faster, and more rocks get in the way. How well will you do?</p>\r\nDonations\r\n<p>Although the game is free to download, it would be very appreciated if you would just donate around half the cost of a cup of coffee.</p>\n<ul><li>If you donate $1 or more, you will be able to download the main theme to the song so you can loop the track and jam out!</li><li>If you donate $2.50 or more, you will gain access to all of the game's code, assets, etc.! Although, make sure you have purchased Game Maker Studio 2 for desktops. Otherwise, you will not be able to access or use the file provided.\u00a0<strong>This is only intended to be used to learn how the game works, not to try to pass it off as your own.</strong></li></ul>\r\nFuture for Project\r\n<p>Although there are some things I wish I could have included before running out of time, I don't think I'll be updating the game after this. Unless if there is a game breaking bug that needs to be fixed, there probably won't be anything else to look for in this project. However, you can follow me here on itch.io for other game jams I'll be participating in!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I must give credit where credit is due. All of these wonderful people did such an amazing job and I can't thank them enough for wanting to collaborate with me. It was a pleasure collaborating with them.</p>\n<ul><li>The game would not look the way it is without <strong>Delthor</strong>! If you want to check him out, click here to go to his itch.io page.</li><li>If you wanted to know the man behind this masterpiece of a main theme, it is none other than <strong>Tobikomi</strong>! He did such an amazing job with the track and deserves all the credit for his work. You should check out his YouTube channel by clicking here.</li><li>Last but not least,\u00a0<strong>Pix</strong> did a fantastic job with setting the mood for the game over scene with his game over theme. Obviously you wouldn't feel good if you got fired, so why not include some feels-y music? You can check out his other tunes on his SoundCloud by clicking here.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65cc1f9bc0179be9e99b24f65260292e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mason Zettlemoyer"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
