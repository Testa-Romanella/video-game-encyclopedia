Player start from a not so clean scene and\u00a0a bar showing anxiety level which goes up automatically. Player cleans up the enemies\u00a0which are dirty faces , hands and bugs.The anxiety level decreases when player attacks with\u00a0the cleaner. A NPC will show up in the next scene and tells the player to find the key to inner\u00a0peace with zero anxiety. The key is a vacuum seal. The player will crawl into a machine that\u00a0vacuum seals her. The final scene will be in a museum where gold frames are hung on the\u00a0wall. Player wins by going into the gold frame , become an artwork and reach inner peace.</p><p>Rules</p><p>The first scene is a platformer game, player needs to kill enemies by attacking them\u00a0with the cleaner. When the enemies are dead, the bar goes down, or it goes up automatically.\u00a0When the player make it through the first level, they jump into a particle system and they will\u00a0see a NPC, press the Q key to interact with him. After that they will go through the vacuum\u00a0sealer to get themselves vacuum sealed. The vacuum sealed player enters the final scene\u00a0which is a museum, going into the gold frame will end the game.</p><p>Artist's Statement</p><p>While discussing about serious games and games more than entertainment, I had an\u00a0idea about making games about anxiety. I was suffering from anxiety for a while, and it made\u00a0me hated myself a lot at that time. I couldn\u2019t feel normal or happy when I see things like bugs\u00a0or anything that I think are unclean. So I joked about vacuum sealing myself to my friends.\u00a0And every time I visit museums in the city I see artworks and I wish I were that calm and\u00a0peaceful. I wanted to show people how it feels like to have anxiety or any kind of disorder. I\u00a0researched about mental illness like anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The\u00a0symptoms for obsessive-compulsive disorder is over cleaning. And anxiety are mostly caused\u00a0by depression. I made the character wear orange colored shirt because it a symbol for what\u00a0prisoners wear in jail. Meaning life with anxiety feels like jail to me. Also there are no eyeballs\u00a0in the eyes. I felt like it could make the character look more empty and hopeless for her life.\u00a0The mechanics for the game are fairly simple. Mostly just moving with the arrows and fighting\u00a0the enemies. It is like life, you move and something bothers you. It is important to make\u00a0yourself comfortable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f80fdeace6308b377c9efafd69b653.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["sleepin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
