{"id": 407629, "slug": "rubber-duck-save-me", "name": "Rubber Duck, Save Me!", "name_original": "Rubber Duck, Save Me!", "description": "<p>This game was originally started for the Taku's Mini Jam (May 2019) on the theme Rubber Duck. I thought interesting to use the concept of rubber duck debugging (reasoning by talking to oneself) in a point-and-click puzzle, while having an actual rubber duck in a bathroom.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>If you have already played games made with Ren'Py, you already know the main controls: click or press Space to continue dialogues.</p>\n<p>In this game, you can also interact with items between dialogues by clicking on them. However, unlike point-and-click adventures, all actions are completely contextual and do not require to select any verb or combination of items. For instance:</p>\n<p>* click on item that can't be taken =&gt; Look at item</p>\n<p>* click on item that can be taken =&gt; take item (there is no inventory, so the item remains in hand until you use it)</p>\n<p>* with item in hand, click on another item for which the combination makes sense =&gt; use item in hand with other item</p>\n<p>The mouse icon will change when hovering an item to show which kind of contextual action would be applied.</p>\r\nScope\r\n<p>The game is pretty short, it only features a few puzzle steps and is a few minutes long.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>I created it in a top-down manner:</p>\n<p>* start with the introduction and ending, with only 1 puzzle step to finish the game</p>\n<p>* insert intermediate puzzle steps  gradually, while making sure that the game can be finished at any time of development</p>\n<p>This proved efficient, as it allowed me to keep a playable version at any step, and decide to stop and release the game with minimal change when I decided that there was enough content.</p>\r\nLicense\r\n<p>The itch.io cover title uses the Purisa font, which is under GPL-2.0.</p>\n<p>Other licenses are defined in the project metadata and in the source code repository.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f0013e4261a5e9703769d5be06ff9eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["komehara"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
