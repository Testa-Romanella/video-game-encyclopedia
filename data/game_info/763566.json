He and his evil minions plan to ruthlessly walk and run towards the Home Base, damaging it.<br/>Thankfully, some guy with an afro is here to take care of that by placing tower-friends and shooting his fists at them.</em></p>\n<p>This project's development is currently <strong>on hold</strong>. In here you'll find a single level, a single playable character, no sound, no story, and no coop. As you may guess, <em>a bit more was planned</em>.</p>\r\nBut! In this game, there is\r\n<ul><li>Main <strong>character leveling</strong>, increasing most <strong>stats </strong>and giving a perk choice every 10 levels until the 50th (<em>Heroes of the Storm</em> inspired).</li><li>Two <strong>towers </strong>to place, each <strong>upgradable </strong>in three paths with new abilities on the third and fifth step (<em>Bloons Tower Defense</em> inspired).</li><li>Three kinds of <strong>enemies </strong>with multiple <strong>variations </strong>so technically it's almost like there are 22 different enemies.</li><li>Dynamic <strong>pathfinding</strong>, using towers to bend enemy paths is recommended.</li><li>Killing enemies to gain rage (mana). Use rage to place towers and upgrade them.</li><li>Hand crafted <strong>models </strong>and <strong>textures</strong>.</li><li>Working <strong>minimap</strong>, zoomable, following the player or centered.</li><li>Two keyboard modes, <strong>Qwerty </strong>and <strong>Azerty</strong>.</li><li>Incredible <strong>replayability </strong>by adding a little star to the title screen if you finish all 30 waves, and maybe more stars if you push on...</li></ul>\r\nHere, and in the <em>ReadMe</em>, are the upgrade paths for the turrets\r\nAfro Wall\r\n<ul><li><strong>Power 3:</strong> Fists touched become explosive.</li><li><strong>Power 5:</strong> Fists touched become very explosive.</li><li><strong>Delay 3:</strong> Students all punch incoming balls to a precise point in front of them.</li><li><strong>Delay 5:</strong> Students shoot their own fists, and target the same point as the player during E spell.</li><li><strong>Armor 3:</strong> Students can punch skulls.</li><li><strong>Armor 5:</strong> Students can punch all bones.</li></ul>\r\nAfro Ball\r\n<ul><li><strong>Delay 3:</strong> While launched, bounces toward closest enemy.</li><li><strong>Delay 5:</strong> While launched, \"bounces\" in the air to redirect toward closest enemy.</li><li><strong>Damage 3:</strong> When ground pounding, creates explosions.</li><li><strong>Damage 5:</strong> When ground pounding, creates more explosions.</li><li><strong>Range 3:</strong> When ground pounding, creates a tornado within its range, hitting multiple times.</li><li><strong>Range 5:</strong> When ground pounding, creates a bigger tornado within its range, hitting multiple times.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Right click </strong>to move.</li><li><strong>Left click</strong> to select towers and shoot fists while in shooting stance.</li><li><strong>Q</strong>, <strong>W</strong>, <strong>E </strong>and <strong>R </strong>to use spells. <strong>Q </strong>and <strong>W </strong>are towers, <strong>E </strong>is a stance to shoot from, and <strong>R </strong>is an \"ultimate\" free to use in this version of the game.</li><li><strong>A </strong>and <strong>D </strong>to move the camera left and right.</li><li><strong>Mouse Wheel</strong> to zoom in and out.</li><li><strong>F</strong> to alternate between an angled camera and a fully vertical one.</li></ul>\r\nPost Scriptum\r\n<p>This was my first real project as a solo game dev and I learned a lot. Of course I would have liked to do things differently, or add way more stuff, but I need to focus on other things right now.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying I will never update this along the line, I plan to, but don't expect a new character or the fabled coop mode anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Oh and this was made with <em>Unity </em>on <em>Windows</em>, can't say I have specifically tested for <em>Linux </em>and <em>Mac</em>. As far as I am aware I don't have the means to accurately test and debug on those two, so I'll take them down if there are problems.</p>\r\nHope you have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T23:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af593b6c02c2580595e53ea0b2f02ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["gorlups"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
