Currently, with effort, you may actually get to\u00a0win this early game, since there are only 30 out of the 101 rooms. The harder to 'impossible' levels start from there. So, feel free to warm up those legs with this early access, and we shall continue from there with constant updates. Once the 101 rooms are available, it is going to be insanely hard to get to the end, no joking. And, the price is going up once fully released!<br/><br/>Thanks for playing and supporting!<br/><em><strong>moh</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T07:07:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c18/c18cc06a6d216a46eefbbf3426d919b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["astroNmoh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
