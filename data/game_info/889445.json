The cliche crafted the main mechanism of the gameplay: pet as many horses as possible, and avoid the skeleton horse (ie, don't beat a dead horse).</p>\n\n<p>Ghost Rodeo is made for the Github Game Off 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Source Code:\u00a0https://github.com/RigorMortisTortoise/ghost-rodeo</p><p>My Website: Rigor Mortis Tortoise</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Menu Song: Spaghetti Western Theme (Orchestral)</p>\n<p>Author: linxiaoma</p>\n\n<p>In-game Song: Spaghetti Western</p>\n<p>Author: Spring Spring</p>\n\n<p>Sound effects obtained from Zatsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T18:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d5a3571fa9d0f117c23e118254a5fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rigormortistortoise"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
