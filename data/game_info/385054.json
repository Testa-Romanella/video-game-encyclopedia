The game is a simple maze game where you must find your way to the center of the maze before your light runs out. Be warned, this maze is not a perfect maze so expect loops and shortcuts that can help or harm you along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is quite rough and I did not have the time to really polish it or play test it much but still happy to have gotten it done. Thanks to the Godot Wild team for putting on this jam!</p>\n<p>Godot version: 3.1.1 release</p>\n<p>Audio and Assets pulled from\u00a0https://opengameart.org\u00a0under\u00a0Public Domain (CC0) License</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T05:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca8/ca8c2af32fde2a3da9b2466755b16f68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pttn40"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
