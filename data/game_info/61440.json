Historically, however, the Vikings were real allrounders: ingenious explorers, merchants, fighters and sailors. They understood, much better than any other people at that time the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to the degree that they may have been in the real life of a Viking.
