The player now has to adapt to, not only moving straight, but also climb vertically and falling in order to get away from their doom!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:07:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e55/e55dfd4b92a8f2709e96662b3890c760.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelcometgames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
