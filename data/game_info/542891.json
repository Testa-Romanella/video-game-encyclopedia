Every encounter offers an opportunity to build up your deck of cards - which are essentially skills unique to each champion. Draft and assemble a finely-honed deck in order to make it all the way to the end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Every champion has their own unique pool of cards and can only play a card that is theirs. By working together a party can pull off powerful combos that would not have been possible to achieve with just one champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is still a very early demo and many elements are yet to be finalized. Which is why I'm here seeking feedback! Please play the demo and let me know what you think :)</p>\n<p>Feel free\u00a0to share any feedback you have here. But the fastest way to get to me would be\u00a0though\u00a0<strong>DISCORD.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can also find me on -<br/>Twitter<br/>Instagram<br/>Tumblr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T04:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86c/86cebcea90d6440671fc2e58002eb191.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yongjustyong"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
