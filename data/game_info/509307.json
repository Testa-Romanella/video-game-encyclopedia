{"id": 509307, "slug": "aimi", "name": "Aimi", "name_original": "Aimi", "description": "Aimi is a short, atmospheric horror game initially created for the IGMC 2018 but which has since been expanded upon and improved. <strong>This game is heavily story-driven, with horror taking a backseat to a more in touch and emotional story and with gameplay being made up of puzzles in between longer cutscenes. An initial playthrough of Aimi could be completed in about 1 hour.  However, there are multiple different endings that can extend gameplay.</strong> Additionally, Aimi was developed as a sort of therapy game by a 16-year-old kid (me!) so do keep that in mind.<br/><br/>While Aimi contains only a few optional jumpscares, there is a lot of <strong>cartoon blood and gore and extensive swearing.</strong> The game <strong>explores themes of mental illness and suicide in a thoughtful manner.</strong><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><strong>Almost every random crash, increase in lag, or other error can be fixed entirely with a simple game restart. If you encounter an error that isn't fixed after a restart, please message me in one of the appropriate forums.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T21:29:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7ade21d180b5bf24fc05bc2469cbd91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Toasty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Toasty"], "esrb_rating": null}
