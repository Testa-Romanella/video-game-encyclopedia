One must be able to see, while the other can be blind. You have to partner up and see how many packages you can deliver.\u00a0The player who <strong>Creates</strong> the room (click on the editable text, text something and Create) will be able to see what happens, but will be unable to control the car. This person will have to give directions to a blind person who will <strong>Join</strong>\u00a0the room (click on the editable text on the side of \"Join\", write the same name as written by the player who created the room and press Join). Play with a blind friend! You can also test how people would manage to deal with blindness, because player two always have a black screen on sight. Just a little secret... you can hear if NPC cars are far or close just by hearing the sound of their engines.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/202/2024bd01a16be4b2ac21443bebfc6543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hidasi Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
