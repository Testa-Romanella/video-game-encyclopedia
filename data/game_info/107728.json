This page is left up for reference for me to compare different works I make at different times. You are still welcome to check it out.</strong></p>\r\n\t\"Honey, everyone who comes to Industry has issues. That's the kind of place this is, and we're the kind of people attracted to it.\"\r\n<p>\r\n\tLilycal Laika is a visual novel set in a Sci-fi universe. The story follows Laika, who ran away from a rogue planet to Industry Colony where she intends to work as a Striker. Laika's adventures will be affected by the various people she meets there, each of whom carry their own emotional baggage. That's the kind of people that Industry attracts - people with issues of their own, who desire an escape from their old world into a reckless thrill-seeking life.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt is still a demo version, and only goes through the first act with glimpses at what each route in the story would be like.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tLilycal Laika was originally made for Tyrano Builder's game jam (about a month), and was further worked on during the Yuri Game Jam (about two weeks worth of added time). I worked on everything myself, apart from the open domain music, so things can be rough - but it was a fun learning experience. I would be interested in joining a team as a writer so I wouldn't have to do everything else alone.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlease try it out, and I hope you enjoy it!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tI would really appreciate it if you would send me feedback at anya [dot] fennec [at] gmail [dot] com.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou may also reach me on twitter @anya_fennec\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThank you for checking out Lilycal Laika!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tUpdate 06/11/15 - Removed some unneeded files, everything should be the same except the download size.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tUpdate 05/11/15 - Converted to ren'py engine, and added a lot of new images and story content.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tUpdate 22/09/15 - Very minor script changes. This is the last build that was made with Tyrano Builder and that falls within TB's jam time limit.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e13f35f3473e570003dd7cbb0aab4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["anya.fennec"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
