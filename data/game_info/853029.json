{"id": 853029, "slug": "detective-horse", "name": "Detective Horse", "name_original": "Detective Horse", "description": "<p>Detective Horse is the result of my biting off more than i could chew for Mini Jam 115: Noir: an attempt to draw, animate, and write a point-and-click graphical adventure game in less than 72\u00a0hours.</p>\n<p>I liked much more the noir style of the jam\u2019s theme than its required limitation, Everything is Temporary, and you won\u2019t see much \u201ctemporary things\u201d, but i could not let the opportunity of developing a simple black-and-white, film noir adventure game pass. \r\nOf course, i one can argue that, since this is a game, once the browser is closed, everything will be lost, thus \u201ctemporary\u201d. There, limitation satisfied!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, 72\u00a0hours are not enough for such an ambitious project, and i ended up with a very, very short game that does not even have a proper story. Also, i am afraid that my sense of humor is very bad, so forgive me for the crude jokes.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you a lot for playing!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The whole game is played with the primary mouse button, the left one by default. It should work with a touchscreen too, but i have not tested it.</p>\n<p>Click anywhere on the screen to advance the dialog. It will show a notice when the conversation is over, and then you can point-and-click at objects. The pointer will change whenever the mouse is hovering anything that can be clicked. Sometimes it can be a small object.</p>\r\nAssets\r\nFonts\r\n<ul>\n<li>Amatic SC by Vernon Adams (github.com/vernnobile)<br/>\r\nLicensed under SIL Open Font License<br/>\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL</li>\n</ul>\r\nMusic\r\n<ul>\n<li>Bass Walker by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution\u00a04.0 License<br/>\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li>\n<li>Fast Talking by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution\u00a04.0 License<br/>\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li>\n</ul>\r\nSounds\r\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking a glass by Vincent Kurt Anderes (freesound.org/people/VincentKurtAnderes)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution-NonCommercial\u00a04.0 License<br/>\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</li>\n<li>Camera Click NIKON by Snapper4298 (freesound.org/people/Snapper4298)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution\u00a04.0 License<br/>\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li>\n<li>Switch ON - Livingroom by MastersDisaster (freesound.org/people/MastersDisaster)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution\u00a04.0 License<br/>\r\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T08:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5eff72d91b24228c6c58a047f012ed8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PerIta Soft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
