The goal of this game (more of an interactive course) is to introduce beginners to the wonders of the world of Computer Science! The game has have two core components:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Lessons:</strong> An interactive course to teach you how to think computationally, how to write programs in Python, and how to design classes using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).<br/></li><li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Multiple choice, short answer, and math problems to test your understanding of Python, computational thinking, and OOP. These challenges are embedded throughout the Lessons, so you can practice your understanding of concepts in real-time under an Active Learning framework.</li></ul><br/>This game assumes absolutely <strong>zero prerequisite background</strong>.
