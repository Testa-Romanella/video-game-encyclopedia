Thank you for checking out this \"game\".</p>\n<p>This was made for Strawberry Jam 7, and the theme was \"Horny Games\".</p>\n<p>Though it may look like it was hacked together in a weekend, we actually had the entire month of February to work on our little abominations. The original concept I had for this game was to make one giant metaphor for the surprisingly epic journey a sperm cell takes to reach the egg, and I had plenty of really cool ideas I was hoping to impliment. Unfortunately, almost all of them had to be cut because I just completely stopped working on my entry after the first week and procrastinated until like the very last day.</p>\n<p>Goddamnit.</p>\n<p>Anyway, ASS-TROIDS thrusts the player into a reasonably accurate simulation of orbit around THE BLACK HOLE SUN and hands them a \"gun\". Your goal is simple: Shoot the space rocks, don't let any of them hit you.</p>\n<p>The challenge, of course, is that your targets are moving, and your \"gun\" is an ejaculating penis. Good luck!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W --- Accelerate forward</p>\n<p>A --- Accelerate left</p>\n<p>S --- Accelerate backward</p>\n<p>D --- Accelerate right</p>\n<p>SPACE --- Accelerate upward</p>\n<p>LSHIFT --- Accelerate downward</p>\n<p>I/J/K/L --- Rotate spaceship</p>\n<p>E --- Roll right</p>\n<p>Q --- Roll left</p>\n<p>P --- Toggle Precision Maneuvering Mode</p>\n<p>TAB --- Toggle 3rd person camera</p>\n<p>F/LMB --- Fire Main Weapon</p>\n<p>R/RMB --- Deploy Grenade</p>\n<p>TIPS AND TRICKS:</p>\n<p>- Your spaceship is already in a stable orbit around THE BLACK HOLE SUN when the game begins. Don't panic, it's not going to immediately suck you in.</p>\n<p>- There is very little friction in space. Your ship will continue to coast even if you are not firing your thrusters. Avoid overdoing your thrusters.</p>\n<p>- Don't aim for where the asteroid is, aim for where it is going to be.</p>\n<p>- If an asteroid is rushing straight for you, shooting it may be more effective than trying to dodge.</p>\n<p>- The little red asteroids with exclamation marks are BOMBS. Feel free to shoot at one, just so long as you keep your distance.</p>\n<p>- Stay away from THE BLACK HOLE SUN. Its gravity causes nearby asteroids to move quickly, making them that much harder to actually hit.</p>\n<p>- Your bullets and grenades are NOT massless. Don't forget to factor in recoil while maneuvering.</p>\n<p>- Beware of Kessler Syndrome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T12:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb071031fc7d0998f2870eaa389cf5a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Q.
