To do this you must travel along the treacherous platforms, obtaining as many coins as possible. Be careful though as enemies like to steal coins. Enemies will also kill you if you get too close so make sure to jump over them. There are also spikes which are like enemies, however they do not move like enemies do.</p>\n<p>To move use the arrow keys, to jump use the up arrow key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T06:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/161c0eb43a801f7c55248541b227b7f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spartan Game Labs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
