Each of them is a skilled fighter, but none of them knows anything about strategy. It is up to you to command them in battle\u00a0and lead them to victory and loot!</p>\n<p><strong>Upgrade Your Squad!</strong><br/>Crabs do not learn quickly - but they sometimes find useful things among the shinies they loot! Each ability or trinket brings something new to the battlefield, making the crab better at a certain role. You need a tank, a damage dealer and a healer? Or maybe you'd like to try something bizzare? Crabs would trust your judgement!</p>\n<p><strong>Attune to Elements!</strong><br/>There are five Elements watching over the coast: Sun, Sand, Wind, Ocean and Greed.\u00a0All of them might be\u00a0willing to lend aid or place their wrath upon beligerent crustaceans. Please them, an they will grant crabs unique powers, enhancing their abilities!</p>\n<p>The game\u00a0in a very early state.\u00a0The development is ongoing (been so for 4+ months) and new things are added every week. Some integral parts are still missing, but what is there already could keep you busy for an hour or two. Your thoughts about the game are very welcome. You can use in-game feedback form, email me at crab.raid.tactics@gmail.com or connect with me (@srvelat) on Twitter!</p>\n<p>Crabs are only gathering for their first try, and although raid wipe is inevitable at this point - the first pack of monsters is about to be pulled.
