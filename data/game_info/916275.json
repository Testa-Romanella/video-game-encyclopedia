It was created with Unity  and written in C# due to the use of ML-Agents i also needed some basic Python lines and a virtual Python environment . This was my Bachelor Project for my Bachelor with Honours in Games Programming at the SAE Institute. It was a Solo Project and the duration of the Development was approximately 4-6 Months. It is  the 6th Project and was the most time consuming Project i've ever done. <br/></p>\n<p>The Aim of the Project was to create a Unity Project that is actually a fully playable Game but the core Focus was the Creation of a Method to implement an AI that learns the Gameplay with Machine Learning. The AI should be able to reach the Goal with as less as Information as possible and at least with acceptable Times compared to a Human Players. Another diffuculty was the aim that only Information a normal Player would have, should be passed to the AI too.  To accomplish this Goals in Time I decided to use ML-Agents as a baseline to get the AI Training done, since creating a own Framework for Machine Learning would have used up allmost all the time for the Project. This was my first experience ever with Machine Learning and ML-Agents so the project included a lot of Research and Reading about how everything works.\u00a0 I learned a lot about ML-Agents, Machine Learning and how effective the usage of such Methods are for the future especially when u have insane Hardware capabilities.</p>\n<p>The training of the AI was only done on my own private Rig with a 10900k and a 3090RTX, which should assume a lot of Power but due to the complexity and the usage of a lot of Raycasts to solve the Problems(wasn't the best way for this Scenario to be used), even this Hardware ran into Performance issues while training, that definitly created a lot of false Training Data and increased the amount of time by a lot, that the Model has to be trained.<br/></p>\n<p>But in the End the AI was capable to get some pretty good Lap times, for only beeing able to detect Enemies and Objects with Raycasts not knowing their direction or speed or anything else.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Game Information:\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Game Idea is based on the WC3 Custom Map Run Kitty Run. It got a little more different enemies than the original and there are no skills or shops included. The perspective of the game is changed to a kind of Third-Person-Perspective to be more challenging<br/></p>\n<p>Game Modes: <br/></p>\n<p>Player vs AI : Comepete in a challenge to meassure your skills with the AI.</p>\n<p>Player Only(Hard): Play a version of the Game with a harder difficulty.</p>\n<p>AI Only: Watch the AI play the game on her own, while beeing able to see the chosen Input. You can also swap to a free Controlable Unity Like Cam by pressing \"Spacebar\".<br/></p>\n<p>Language of the Game: English only   \r\n</p>\n<p>Playtime/Duration: Approximatly 1:30 - 4:00 Minutes</p>\n<p>There is a bug that is not showing the correct rewards for the Player and AI, so the only way to meassure is actually the Lap time. This also applies for the HighscoreBoard.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T15:10:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71ecbf5baa229167108cabed9f640ca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stefan M\u00e4nnel"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
