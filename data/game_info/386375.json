{"id": 386375, "slug": "campers-vs-counselors", "name": "Campers vs. Counselors!", "name_original": "Campers vs. Counselors!", "description": "<p>This is a game all about facing off in the ultimate battle - a campers vs. counselors dodgeball game! You play as a lone counselor, the last one left on your team, tasked with playing against six campers of various ages and skill levels. Avoid what they throw at you, and throw balls back at them - but don't get a headshot, or you'll be out! I actually have been working as a day camp counselor for the last several summers, and have played this kind of dodgeball match several times. The nature of being vastly outnumbered by an army of children felt very game-like, so I decided for it to be my topic.</p>\n\n<p>When I started work on this game, I actually wasn't really sure if it was what I wanted to do: I had stronger memories to pick from, and I wasn't sure if I could pull off the technical aspects of <em>this</em> idea. But after a slow start in which I barely got my character to jump, I managed to get help where I needed it and progressed on my own. It was fun making the throw code, and although I was dreading trying to duplicate that into my AI enemies, that ended up being enjoyable as well when I just got down to doing it. Designing the game world and making models in Maya was a bit more tedious, especially since most of the world is made of background objects that cannot be interacted with. I think that I ended up spending so much time agonizing over the next challenge in the project that I neglected to use that time to do simple things instead, leading to a much larger pile-up of work at the end of the project than could have been necessary. That said, I was in a far better position than I thought I would have been by the time the 3rd milestone was due.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:48:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/528/528aedcb86fb2fcd3f5e9cfe3480afd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adamax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
