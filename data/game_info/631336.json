It is a game that tells a story about a magic world and a small town called Athilidus. You get there but at first there is nothing to look at... You have to make it filled with life once again. Build new houses and invite more people into town. Build factories to help the city develop. And of course, decorate it to your taste so the people in town are happier.</p>\n\n<p>The whole process of creation of this game you can find on mu YouTube channel Tamara Makes Games. I shared all the wins and struggles that I had while making this game. The development is not over yet! I will be posting more updates on this game so be sure to subscribe.</p>\n\n<p>I made the game already available to play because I want you to actually feel it and not just see how it is being developed. In most cases, great games take years to develop. And I don\u2019t even know if this game will ever be finished and released. So, to not waste the work I\u2019ve done I am publishing it right now.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In addition, this way I can discover bugs or simply things that you don\u2019t like about the game. If you spot something that is working incorrectly \u2013 leave me a comment.</p>\n<p>Some bugs that I know of:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Web build - no saving (this is intentional)</li><li>Android - touches go through UI (very annoying, trying to fix)</li><li>PC - everything's fine (I hope)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b67c3c706ca1d6d05aeda8905ca7a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Tamara"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
