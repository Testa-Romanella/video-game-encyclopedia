Help Santa enter houses, deliver presents, and leave - all without being seen or detected by the automated robots his elves have made to help him train.<br/><br/><h3>ELF-MADE STEALTH TRAINING WAREHOUSE</h3><br/>This year, due to social distancing requirements, Santa can't undertake his normal training. Thankfully, his elves have crafted a fully automated Santa training area in a disused warehouse - with lots of \"houses\" for Santa to sneak his way through. <strong>Help Santa complete his training ahead of the Christmas period, by sneaking through all five house layouts to deliver presents in record time.</strong><h3>YOU BETTER WATCH OUT</h3><br/>Make your way through fake houses, past fake robot residents, and place some fake presents.
