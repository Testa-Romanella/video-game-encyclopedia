Sometimes that&#39;s more than enough.<br />\n(Still, you&#39;re anxious, aren&#39;t you?)<br />\n- Of course. Moreover, I&#39;m completely terrified. Was it that obvious?<br />\n(You&#39;re looking in every direction, but not up.)<br />\n- Ah, this...<br />\n- I&#39;ve already told you, haven&#39;t I?<br />\n(About what?)<br />\n- Ah, you know, small stuff.<br />\n(Can small stuff make you terrified?)<br />\n- It&#39;s... hard to explain.<br />\nI climb up the metal railing and let my legs hang down. I sneak short glances at the abyss from time to time. It replies with angry, cold breath. That&#39;s how we interact. Like old friends.<br />\n- Sometimes I feel like the whole world pretends to be crazy.<br />\n- As if it&#39;s trying to make me believe in something that doesn&#39;t exist.<br />\n(That&#39;s weird, isn&#39;t it?)<br />\nThe game is a sequel to Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk.<br />\nThe game&#39;s events begin the same moment the first game ends.GAME&#39;S KEY FEATURES:Psychedelic narrative full of pyramidal verbal constructions.<br />\nStylized pixel graphics which reflect the girl&#39;s distorted perception of the world.<br />\nHigh variability: each playthrough is unique. However, some dialogue lines, images and scenes have only a small chance of appearing; you&#39;ll have to really get close to the girl in order to find out everything she hides.<br />\nOppressive and viscous soundtrack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T13:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2a8/2a88f50fc8fe893de15a3bbcae992b01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 36, "owned": 362, "beaten": 88, "toplay": 43, "dropped": 8, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 76, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nikita Kryukov"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nikita Kryukov"], "esrb_rating": null}
