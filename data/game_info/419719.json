I am Sinless Hornet and I\u00b4m here to bring you my latest (and first) game in early development; Almost Gone. In Almost Gone you take the role of Eleanor, a young adult working for a mailing company. After being asigned with the delivery of a mysterious letter, Eleanor finds herself lost in a weird place full of weird characters, some of which are eager to help Eleanor and some of which are eager to eat her. But that\u00b4s adult life, right?<br />\nAs I said before, right now the game is in early development, and I would REALLY appreciate some love from you. You can test it, and tell me what was your experience. It\u00b4s free, after all! I am willing to accept any feedback, as long as it is constructive critique.Game features (as of now):+A colorful cast of characters that may try to charm you!+The alpha for the first chapter of the story+Turn-based combat, wow+Not much else. (Hey, I\u00b4m working on it!)<br />\nI have to thank to Pencil Arsenal (IG: pencil_arsenal) for helping me with the artwork, and Yanfly for their fantastic plugins.And there you go, I don\u00b4t know what else to say.
