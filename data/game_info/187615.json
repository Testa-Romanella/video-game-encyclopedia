As such, much attention was directed towards re-creating the fine architecture and historic details of each individual building within the main street, such as the church, which has evidence of construction dating back to the 14th century. Due to the long history of the town, each building or plot of land has surely had a long history, and evidentially the style of architecture does vary from building to building. Importantly, the environment was constructed based of recent pictures of the street Which means many of the buildings may have changed over time or could have been completely remodeled from its original design. That being said, it is to my knowledge that most of these buildings, in accordance with the preservation rules and regulations of historic buildings, have only changed in relation to the facade or shop based aspect, preserving the original architecture of the building.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The scene, as much as it focuses on the architecture of each building, also attempts to create an environment with a unified colour palette, and to create this; textures have been re-used on different buildings, in accordance with colour and style to match the original, but to also unify the street in style and colour.</p>\n<p>How you explore of react to the environment, may certainly vary depending on your interests. I believe that this game offers more to people who have an interest in history, architecture, or culture as apposed to people who are looking for an action based, or a fast paced environment.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0There is no objective to the game in a traditional sense, rather the game or more appropriately the \u2018environment\u2019, simply hopes to capture the beauty of a specific time and place and present it in an aesthetically pleasing manor for all to enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62c625e14521aec8bd40139df3943cab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["S3600609"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
