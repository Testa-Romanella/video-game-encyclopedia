Each player can capture the ball by using their tractor beam, or try to dislodge the ball from another player by firing their weapon. If the ball has been captured the player can fire the ball at a target by releasing it from the tractor beam. The player can also score by ramming the ball, or hitting it with a weapon hit (propelling the ball into a goal area).ControlsEach player can use the keyboard to control their jetpack, but a gamepad is definitely recommended.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/586/586f35fa2cdda20233b5cd3e583c72f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B Rees"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["B Rees"], "esrb_rating": null}
