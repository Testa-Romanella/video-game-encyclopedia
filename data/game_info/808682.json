It's kinda like snake but in space! Built using Godot 4 Alpha 7.</p>\n<p>I always struggle with scope creep when trying to get into a gamedev project, so this time I wanted to build something with the mindset of a gamejam. I had a week-plus vacation from work, so my goal was to build and publish a game before my vacation was over. By the end of the week, I had something that was playable with most of the art in place to boot, but I held off on publishing it until I got a few kinks ironed out. So, I didn't meet my original goal, but I still feel that this was a positive expierence overall!</p>\n<p>Since that first week or so of progress, I've added music and sound effects, a few settings in the main menu, a few gameplay and visual tweaks, and some performance improvements. I also implemented controller support with help and contributions from @asheliahut!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T19:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f6/9f6f1d647fcbd41771aaacac1c803bbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kylewlacy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
