It was directed by Akira Kitamura, with Nobuyuki Matsushima as lead programmer, and is the first game of the Mega Man franchise and the original video game series. Mega Man was produced by a small team specifically for the home console market, a first for Capcom, who previously focused on arcade titles.</p>\n<p>The game begins the struggle of the humanoid robot and player-character Mega Man against the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six Robot Masters under his control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in a \"Robot Master\" boss battle that awards the player-character a unique weapon.</p>\n<p>Critics praised Mega Man for its overall design, though the game was not a commercial success. Mega Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions that define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs. The game has since been included in game compilations and rereleased on mobile phones, console emulation services. It received a full 3D remake titled Mega Man Powered Up in 2006.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T01:42:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75e4208b398749d84f0e71e1ac54bf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.99, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 70, "beaten": 163, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 43, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 137, "suggestions_count": 420, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 141, "platforms": ["Wii U", "Android", "Wii", "PlayStation", "Nintendo 3DS", "iOS", "NES"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Sony Interactive Entertainment America"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
