The final version will be released Summer 2015. If you enjoy the demo and want to see more, please help us out and vote for us on Steam Greenlight!</p><p>Glorch's Great Escape is a challenging puzzle platformer where your only weapon is the almighty \"Telenade.\" Guide Glorch from his prison cell through the defenses of his captor's space station, and discover why he was locked up in the first place. <br/><br/>You'll be solving plenty of difficult platforming puzzles and scenarios, finding some secrets, smashing a few robots, and generally dying a whole bunch of times. We've made sure to include a freshly composed jazzy soundtrack to help keep your platformer rage levels in check. <br/><br/>This game is based on our top 20 entry of the same name from Ludum Dare 32. We have reworked the art/sound, refined the controls, and have added lots of new levels, but you are encouraged to try the Ludum Dare version on the Ludum Dare website if you would like to see its beginnings. ( http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&amp;uid=51056 ) </p><p><strong>So what is a Telenade, and why is Walking for Chumps?</strong></p><p>Glorch can waddle left and right if he must, but he isn't even going to attempt to jump. That sounds like too much effort. Besides, why bother walking when you can just teleport wherever you want to go within range of a short throw? Only chumps would do that.</p><p><strong>What is a Glorch anyway?</strong></p><p>Glorch is a member of the Glorches, a race of...ahem...\"big boned\" purple aliens. They are the inventors of the Telenade.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff0dbffad13291f421996479b59059c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Warrior General Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
