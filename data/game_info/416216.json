However,\u00a0 he never really thought about trying to participate in the event, at least until his godfather/guardian Ronald told him that he could possibly take on a job overseas for two years leaving the colt all alone. Since Ronald has been his only companion ever since his parents died when he was thirteen Roger finds himself desperate not to be separated from the older shepherd. How coincidental that the sponsor of Quicksilver Championship has just opened up an all expense paid year for young equines to come and train at his mansion!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Is such a thing too good to be true?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Roger doesn't care.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only thing he's concerned with is not being separated from the only family member that he has left in the world.</p>\n<p>Of course, his lack of concern behind the particulars of what's happening around him may cause him much more grief than he's prepared to endure.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps, it might just make him into a stallion, the likes of which the world will come to admire above all else.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Want to hear his story?</p><p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/BeastiDragon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcd698552137a1d8cd69347f9773bad3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["xneobeastx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
