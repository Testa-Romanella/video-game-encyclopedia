It's inspired by games like Everyday Shooter and Kamilia 3. I made this game to push my limits as a player, so it's rather hard, but I hope that it's fun.\u00a0The current build includes one level with music by Milana Zilnik. The distribution also contains some unused art and music tucked away somewhere.</p>\n<p>This is a very early build.\u00a0It isn't optimized, and might not run on your computer at all! Only the windows version has been tested, and only on Windows 7.\u00a0Good luck!</p>\n<p>Press \"a\" or move into the test boss portal to begin. During a level, press \"i\" to turn on invulnerability. Move with the arrow keys, use \"x\" to slow down, and press space to activate a teleport marker, release space to jump to the marker. \"f\" will fast-forward, which may cause desync. \"k\" will skip the boss altogether. Other buttons might do other even less useful things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T06:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c39/c3994fcb9a4c49efe4daf9c11ffd1825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spriteguard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
