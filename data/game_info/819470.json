In order to reach the escape pods,\u00a0you will need to\u00a0collect and shoot unique dice at your enemies during fast and deadly duels.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>use WASD to control your character\r\n</p>\n<p>use your mouse to select your dice during combat\r\n</p>\n<p>press ESC to access the menu\r\n</p>Mechanics explanation<p>Due to time limitation, we were not able to include tutorial in game (for which we are sorry!). Instead we offer you the following explanation.</p><p>In combat use dice with different effects to your advantage. Any die you shoot will damage the opponent, while dice you left in your pocket will act as a shield and prevent damage dealt by your enemy. In addition, playing dies with similar values after each other will deal double damage.\u00a0Collect unique\u00a0dice and select your favourites in inventory between battles.</p><p>In the inventory screen the player can specify the amount of dice of each type the player wants to use in combat. Mind you, the more dice of one type, means less chance of getting other types!\u00a0<br/></p><p>In each turn, the player has 3 dice with values visible, and 3 dice with values obscured, shown as \"???\". The player can later unlock upgrade that makes more dice visible.<br/>The player can acquire additional multipliers by loading dice in certain sequences. Loading into chambers dice which values are multiplicities of the previous dice, will result in x2 modifier, or x3 modifier (if the sequence is 3 dice long).<br/>For example: 2, 4; 1, 2, 4; 6, 12 etc.</p>\r\nAssets used\r\n<p>Visuals:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>\u201cWarped Top-Down Tech Lab\u201d and \u201cBulkhead Walls Environment\u201d by ansimuz https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-top-down-tech-lab\r\nhttps://ansimuz.itch.io/bulkhead-walls-environment\r\n</li><li>\"Pixelated Attack/Hit Animations\" by Viktor<br/>https://v-ktor.itch.io/pixelated-attackhit-animations</li></ul>\n<p>Sounds:\r\n</p>\n<p>freesound: cgeffex,casadalenha, mypantsfelldown, soundslikewillem, flem0527, Uhnji_, ryansitz, acidsnowflake\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Coding and Unity development - Robert Zych\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound and UI Design - Miko\u0142aj Bujak (https://bjk.design)\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0Lead Art Design - Nikodem Chmielewski\r\n</p>\n<p>Game Design, Production and additional Art - Teofil Chmielewski (https://radiatore.itch.io)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/208/2088ef6fc87b73636d7b0dcd46a52913.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radiatore"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
