Inspired by the majesty of chickens with swole arms, they banded together over 80 days and across 6 time zones to create Teddy Gainz and the Horror of Insect Island, the first game from the Teddy Gainz Productions Team. Our team had a blast learning how to make a game together and participating in our first game jam here on Itch.io. We hope you enjoy playing our game as much, if not more than we enjoyed getting to know each other and building it! Thank you!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>&lt;3 The TG Team\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Letter From the\u00a0Update Team</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Over the last seven months, we have had the pleasure of getting to know Teddy, Thicc, the inhabitants of The Sunnyside Ilses, and each other even better. We endeavored to bring to life the whole original story our team conceived for the game jam\u00a0\u00a0with playability that would make it fun and accessible for more players to enjoy. We corrected so many typos, made so many new assets, fixed so many bugs (big and small) and laughed so much while making this game. We hope even more people can share in that joy and this story of friendship.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Our team had so much fun we have already selected another jam to participate in please follow us on Itch.io, Twitter, and Youtube\u00a0to see what we make next!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>&lt;3 The TG\u00a0Team\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Update Credits\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Amber Nicole Williams - Game Artist -\u00a0@Ambrowskii\u00a0-\u00a0ambrowskii.itch.io\u00a0-LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0https://ambrowskii.com<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Ricardo Aviles - Game Designer / Developer / Sound Designer -\u00a0@ricky_games20\u00a0 -\u00a0ricardoaviles.itch.io\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn</em></p>\n<p><em>Kenna Lindsay - Executive Producer -\u00a0@kenna_lindsay\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0kennamlindsay.com\u00a0</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Original</strong><strong>\u00a0Credits\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Amber Nicole Williams - Game Artist -\u00a0@Ambrowskii\u00a0-\u00a0ambrowskii.itch.io\u00a0-LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0https://ambrowskii.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Anfer Molina - Game Designer / Developer - @anferm\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Cindy Fan - Art Director / Game Artist -\u00a0@CindFan\u00a0-\u00a0itch.io/profile/cindf\u00a0-\u00a0www.cind.ca\r\n</p>\n<p>Cynthia Sulit - Producer / Artist - Twitter\u00a0@mcjsulit\u00a0 -\u00a0Arch + Form (portfolio.site)\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Dawn Hammond-Quaye - Game Designer / Developer -\u00a0@TheArtemis_Moon\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0dawnhq.co.uk\r\n</p>\n<p>Jon Perez - Production Consultant -\u00a0@darthgreebo\r\n</p>\n<p>Kenna Lindsay - Executive Producer -\u00a0@kenna_lindsay\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0kennamlindsay.com\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Leyla Mamedova - QA -\u00a0@leylses\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0-\u00a0leylamamedova.com\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Morgan Anderson - Game Artist / Character Artist -\u00a0artstation.com/breaded\u00a0- \u00a0morganderson.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Ricardo Aviles - Game Designer / Developer / Sound Designer -\u00a0@ricky_games20\u00a0 -\u00a0ricardoaviles.itch.io\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn\r\n</p>\n<p>Rika Watanabe -\u00a0 Narrative Designer / Game Writer -\u00a0@riki_0ntherocks\u00a0-\u00a0itch.io/profile/riki-0ntherocks\u00a0-\u00a0LinkedIn</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0(People who supported, listened to, encouraged, and loved us while we did this.
