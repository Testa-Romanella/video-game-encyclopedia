It's also an experiment in gamifying content and making more educational resources available online. If the community finds this useful, I'd love to produce more of these types of resources, in a range of subjects with no cost ever: They'll always be free to install, share and use. Let me know in the reviews if gamifying learning content and revision questions in this way is something that you think may have potential. <strong>Thanks for playing</strong>!!!<br/><br/>\"I'm done revising.. how can I LEARN new stuff?!?!\" Well...additional FREE physiology and anatomy video content is covered on my YouTube channel: \"<strong>Physiology with Dr Christian</strong>\": - Check it out by clicking \"Visit the website\" on the right sidebar.<br/><br/>PS: I'm on Instagram too - visit and say hi: <strong>@physiologywithchristian</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6d6c6d92640ec1b365e20a2fdad8b34.jpg", "website": "http://www.youtube.com/c/PhysiologywithChristian", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Physiology with Dr Christian"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Physiology with Dr Christian"], "esrb_rating": null}
