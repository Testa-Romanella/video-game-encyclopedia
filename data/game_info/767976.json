The player, as a musician, gets a drum loop in his/her mind and he/she is going to realize it. So in this game, you will listen the loop once and then use the instruments to rebuild it, and once again, etc. However, you can only use the given random instrument once, and change into another one.(The sequence is shown on the left side, from top to bottom) Don\u2019t worry, the correct beats are saved in the next turn. (just like a loop! =D) Realize the beats before the music ends and the instruments run out!\r\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve just created two levels (A and B). And I tried to use various ways to make the game look better.\r\n</p>\n<p>The connection between this game and the topic is, the time is inevitable. As is written on the tape, I used pixelated style\uff0cwith Lo-Fi music and the tape to compose the game. I want to memorize the gone days with this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s a far-fetched explanation because I first want this game an endless one (auto-generated beats!). I failed because it\u2019s too hard.\r\n</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I really want this game packed in WebGL, but I encountered an error from unity in the process of packing (I tried for almost 3 hours\u2026). I would like to know if there\u2019re solutions or someone can help.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, thanks a lot for playing! ENJOY!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb93a3b998de613a0d94cfc270db8346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jyumonji_x"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
