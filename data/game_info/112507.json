It's all about growing, and it is also about using two buttons to rotate left and right. The more things you absorb the bigger the Tornado will be. <br/><br/>Notes <br/>===== <br/>-Please, give some time to the game to download and start (WebGL). <br/>-If you play from Ludum Dare page you won't see the destruction progress bar. <br/>-Alternate left and right to go into straight direction. <br/><br/><br/>Controls <br/>======== <br/>Option 1: Left + Right (Keyboard and Joystick) <br/>Option 2: Mouse button left + Mouse button right <br/>Option 3: Key A + Key D <br/><br/>Development <br/>=========== <br/>This time I could only develop for one day, I had a good idea but not much time, this is why the game is less polished than I would like. There is no sound, no sharks, and, once more, there are no enemies. <br/><br/>Game is developed using Unity 5, MSVS and Paint shop pro. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b29ad9c7f0c19abc490a761c87f280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["zener"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
