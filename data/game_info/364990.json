Use the power of art to explore, solve puzzles, help your animal friends and restore color to the world. Created by Greg Lobanov (Wandersong), Lena Raine (Celeste,  Guild Wars 2), Em Halberstadt (Night in the Woods, Wandersong, Untitled Goose Game), and newcomers Alexis Dean-Jones and Madeline Berger!<br />\nThe Brush is a one-of-a-kind artifact that can color the world. Naturally, it needs a wielder, a master artist responsible for all colors and for passing the brush down. The current wielder, Chicory, is immensely talented and beloved by all... until all the color in the land vanishes, and her with it! I guess that leaves it up to you, her number one fan, to take up the brush and fill in for her. Hmm... good luck!<br />\nExplore the Picnic Province, and draw on anything!<br />\nManipulate the environment with your paint and solve puzzles!<br />\nUnlock new paint abilities and use them to reach new places!<br />\nCollectible clothes, plants and furniture to dress your character and the world how you want!<br />\nA world full of animal characters to help and befriend!<br />\nLocal co-op! Play with your friends and paint together!<br />\nIt&#39;s like Zelda in a coloring book world, with a dash of Animal Crossing!</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "2021-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-10T16:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/710/71095dec34962a167121a9d67838818f.jpg", "website": "http://draw.dog", "rating": 3.94, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 35, "owned": 238, "beaten": 47, "toplay": 84, "dropped": 36, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 103, "ratings_count": 63, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 63, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Finji", "Greg Lobanov"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Greg Lobanov"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
