Is a fast paced platformer created as a submission for MiniJam 108 - Seaside. It is also my first ever game that I've 'finished', and published! :D</p>\n<p>The tide is rising fast, and unlike your brother and sister crabs, you haven't learnt how to swim yet! Jump and climb your way to the top to escape the rushing water and meet up with your fellow crabby friends.</p>\n<p>The game features turtles! Watch out for their sharp beaks though. Their bite will kill you in one hit. Falling in the water will kill you (in one hit?). And stepping on sand will break it (the hit from the crab's legs kill it one hit?) If you hadn't guessed, the limitation for the jam was: Everything dies in one hit.</p>\n<p>All assets used, graphics and scripts were made by myself in three days. Run out of time for music and sounds.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: WASD or arrows</p>\n<p>Jump/Wall jump: Space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T05:54:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8e263d45a9c124bdfb294f36f694078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lukas Buchel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
