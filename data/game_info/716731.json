It features the three famous animatronics from the Slammy's Pizzeria franchise, named \"Slammy\" and \"Ashley\" and \"Paul\".\u00a0 All unique in their designs and do not infringe on any copyright law (for legal reasons that is a joke).</p>\n<p>Special thanks to BruhMoment76 and\u00a0AshAnimates who helped me with this project with voice acting. This was originally an easter egg for DOOMORI 2 but we decided to flesh it out as a full minigame.
