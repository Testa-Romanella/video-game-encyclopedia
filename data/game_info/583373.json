There is no ending, just see how long you can survive.<br/><br/>[Dev Note]<br/>I had more plans for this, but ran out of time after spending way too long on bugs. I wanted to expand on the horror theme, by making additional noises, monsters, and even have the obstacles look at the player and talk. I got 2 different bugs that took me way too long to fix and thus I could not deliver on any of this.\u00a0I stuck to my theme though and it is time to release it. There will not be any future additions outside of fixing any major bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b53e85723e7fa4767a69395c6a4df93e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["7 Day Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
