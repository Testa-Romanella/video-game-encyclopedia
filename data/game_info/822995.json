You have the unique ability to  jump inside other boxes to help you jump higher, get over spikes, and  use switches! Can you clear all sections of the warehouse?\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is mainly a demonstration of a more complex idea that I <em>might</em>  carry on developing, depending on how the reception for this demo goes.  I might add a level editor, a new user interface, more customisable  controls and tutorials, as well as new blocks, boxes, and game  mechanics.\r\n    </p>\n<p>Made for the My First Game Jam: Summer 2022 https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2022<br/></p>\n\n<p>Coding, Concept and In-game Art by Jamaco\r\n    </p>\n<p>Box Art/Title Screen by Michael Zhang\r\n    </p>\n<p>Music by Kevin Macleod from incompetech.com\r\n    </p>\n<p>Sound Effects by Mike Koenig from soundbible.com\r\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T20:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2dd103e4136dc6c1026196e7eac1910.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["jamaco"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
