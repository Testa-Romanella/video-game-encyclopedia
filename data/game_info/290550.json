Killing enemy ships or holding special positions decreases\r\nthe enemy team's ticket counter. A team wins if the other team's counter hits zero. Your ships spawn at <em>jump gates</em> held by your team.\r\nYou can conquer further jump gates by flying close to them while there is no enemy ship around.\r\nJump gates with a green arrow next to their name spawn NPC cruisers. The players choose one of four <em>ship classes</em>.</p>\n<ul><li><em>Fighter</em> for ordinary combat.</li><li><em>Bomber</em> to tackle big cruisers and stations.</li><li><em>Scout</em> for quick strikes at unexpected positions. (Scouts jam the enemy radar to a certain degree, but also counter enemy jamming.)</li><li><em>Support</em> which regenerate friendly ships or supply them with new ammunition.</li></ul>\n<p>The <em>fighting</em> is quite similar to FreeSpace, Freelancer and other space games.</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: regulate the forward/backward/sideward thrust.</li><li>Q and E: roll.</li><li>Tab: enable the after burner</li><li>Middle mouse button: lock targets (highlighted by a rectangle)</li><li>Left/right mouse button: fire at the targeted ship</li><li>Ctrl trigger special ability.
