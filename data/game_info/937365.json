{"id": 937365, "slug": "untitled-space-station-rat-fetching-experience-dem", "name": "Untitled Space Station Rat Fetching Experience [DEMO]", "name_original": "Untitled Space Station Rat Fetching Experience [DEMO]", "description": "<p>[WARNING: VERY VERY EARLY PROTOTYPE]</p>\n<p>This is a proof-of-concept demo for a first person 3d Space Station game, heavily influenced by Space Station 13 and games like Deus Ex and Morrowind.</p>\n<p>No graphics are final, there is barely audio, lighting is basically out-of-the-box Godot default,\u00a0and expect jank in controls. This is a WIP prototype meant for gathering feedback. This is likely to be updated several times as development continues.</p>\n<p>The Goal:</p>\n<p>In this demo, I'm hoping players will try to reach the rat NPC standing on the far right top corner from where you enter the room. There are a number of ways to reach it, I'd love feedback on which if any were used. There's currently no quest/reward system in place.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move around</li><li>Left/Right click: Use left/right hand actions</li><li>Tab: Exit dialogue, switch between both left and right hand intents</li><li>Q/E: Switch between individual hand intents</li><li>C: Toggle crouch</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>R: Restart game</li></ul>\n<p>Dialogue:</p>\n<p>Currently you can ask people about specific topics, similar to Morrowind. Their disposition can affect their responses. A lot of dialogue / item description is placeholder currently.</p>\n<p>Disposition:</p>\n<p>Disposition is raised and lowered based off your actions and what the NPCs observe. Hitting or dragging someone will lower their disposition for instance.</p>\n<p>Lockpicking:</p>\n<p>You can lockpick doors by interacting with a door and selecting \"Lockpick\". Click the large grey circle to try and catch the spinning cursor over a target before time runs out. Missing decreases the timer.</p>\n<p>Hacking:</p>\n<p>Guide the mouse through the maze, sort of like operation. You can hack terminals to boobytrap them, or open doors, or hack Maynard the robot to do all kinds of stuff.</p>\n<p>Climbing:</p>\n<p>Using the \"grab\" intent on something mounted will let you climb it by holding jump. When you're not holding jump, you will slowly descend. In order to climb a ladder you need to alternate hitting left and right hand grabs. It is difficult to climb a ladder while holding something, so try throwing it to your destination.</p>\n<p>Throwing:</p>\n<p>Hold the \"throw\" option to throw a held object. The further you hold, the further the throw.</p>\n<p>The Brig:</p>\n<p>Misbehaving will likely end up with you being dragged to the brig. The sentences are short, but can mean that whatever havoc you caused previously has time to be cleaned up. There are a number of ways to escape the brig.</p>\n<p>Grates:</p>\n<p>Grates are bolted onto the wall with screws. You can find a screwdriver to try and remove them. You can also hang from grates.</p>\n<p>music by turgidharrier</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T15:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/328c721093bb82a94edb28ea7b0dcc3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["bokoyoss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
