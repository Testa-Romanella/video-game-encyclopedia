In the last few days, thoughts<br/>\r\nhad appeared in his mind - he somehow missed the days of his<br/>\r\nadventuring.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMonty closed his eyes and decided to take forty winks.

From the cloud, rays of light beamed out which swirled and<br/>\r\ndarted over the terrain as though they were looking for something.  He<br/>\r\nsaw a ray of light advancing towards him and felt \"butterflies\"<br/>\r\nerrupting into a frenzy in his stomach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is a shooter platformer genre played over five levels.  <br/>\r\nYou are able to select levels 1 to 4 at random, but to play level 5, <br/>\r\nyou must have completed the previous four levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach level contains food and supplies to help you on your travels.<br/>\r\nYou may find a friendly shop keeper.
