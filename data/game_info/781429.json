As you progress in the game you will encounter several enemies\u00a0and a two-stage boss fight. There are several pickups to collect as you progress that can both help you in the\u00a0overworld and in combat. Each pickup has a glowing white aura to differentiate them from the rest of the plants.</p>\n<p>During combat, you can choose between two different attack types, bracing, and using pickups to enhance attacks or\u00a0heal. There is a small window on both attack and defense where an icon pops up signifying a quick time event that\u00a0can empower attacks and increase damage resistance.\u00a0</p><p>There are several green beacon plants that indicate the correct\u00a0path to each boss. There are also breakable walls in the overworld that require one Bombeii Worm pickup to destroy.\u00a0The minimap can also be used to navigate the space, both enemies and pickups appear on the minimap.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p> Natural disasters ravage the planet and scientists have tracked the source to the Marianas Trench. Your crew is\u00a0one of many sent to investigate the source and put a stop to it. As you explore the deepest parts of the world's ocean\u00a0you encounter new species of plants and animals, and discover an ancient eldritch creature. This creature isn't\u00a0interested in letting you leave the trench alive.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Nick Corcillo - Music Composer</p>\n<p>Harrison Dresser - Intern</p>\n<p>Stan Morris - Professor Voice Actor</p>\n<p>Gideon Shbeeb - Executive Producer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b782382386e1900d670da20375cb5c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FloridaManCam"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
