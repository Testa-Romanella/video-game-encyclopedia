Use Alt F4 to quit the game as due to time constraints we couldn't add a pause menu. Use E to mount the elephant.</p>\n<p>Since the deadline was tight we could not fix all the bugs and optimize the game so you can expect some bugs and low fps if playing on low spec PC. We highly recommend to play on a high end PC for a smooth experince ;p.</p>\n<p>Note- The elephant caught some bugs but it can still attack your enemies :D. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T12:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/060/0609cb654c82246e43acc4ff8d9624e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ancient_India_Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
