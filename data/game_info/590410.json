The game currently has a very short play time but I hope you enjoy the day in the life of a cat.</p>\n<p>This project was based upon the 2d shooter files presented by Michigan State Uni. Various changes have been made:</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 A complete theme change. This is no longer your grandparents space shooter. The theme also includes a full narrative and characters.</p>\n<p>2. Sprite change! After quickly learning to create pixel art, I\u00a0 designed my own sprites, to completely change the way the game looks. Everything you see has been made by me!</p>\n<p>3. Music and SFX changes. Some of the music has been sourced but a couple of the sound effects were recorded from my own pets.</p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Additional levels. Originally the course project started out with 1 level, this has now been expanded to 3 chapters. Find out even more about Kedi!</p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 Expanded cut scenes to add to the drama! With audio and SFXs as well.</p>\n<p>One of the more complete projects I've recently done.</p>\n<p>Created by Daryl J Peel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T09:29:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/06620de7c3f14da6aa5bffbeb1e0d066.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
