This is more economical than employing humans, but without supervision can lead to catastrophic results. Just such a catastrophe has happened, and you have been employed on a temporary basis to clean up the mess. The data cards needed to keep the facility running have been scattered all over the various levels, and need putting back in the data card readers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dangerous for humans to enter the facility, so you have to do your job remotely. You do this with the aid of a team of specialised robots. On each level you need to choose a robot, sometimes more robots, who are best equipped to do the job. Once the robots are deployed, you instruct them to pick up the data card and take it to the reader.\r\n</p>\n<p>That sounds easy, but there are obstacles. Contraptions like turntables, conveyor belts and teleporters may help or hinder your task. Security forcefields might block your way and need to be deactivated or otherwise bypassed. And some levels have guard robots which patrol the area; these are unaware of your important task and might destroy you if you are not careful.\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Team Droid</strong></em>\u00a0is a turn-based puzzle game that rewards careful thinking rather than fast reactions. You must examine each level to see which robots are most suited to it, and then instruct those robots turn by turn on exactly what to do. There is a library of actions you can choose from, but because of the state of chaos, not all of the actions are available each turn. So you will have to think ahead and improvise.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Requires DOSBox to run.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T14:45:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e3a0863836d4b0b31bd685fd0b3bf60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyningstan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
