The fourth player controls the Brain and can therefore control the environment, with a laser turret shooting the minions, boxing gloves to punch them and fire traps to burn them!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When the players start the game, they will customize their playable minion with different hairstyles and items on their back so they can play as the minion that reflects their own personality! The players will then take turns controlling the Brain and will get points based on how much damage they\u2019re able to make. The other players will get points when completing a level, a task or picking up special cogwheels. In the end, only one will be the winner of the round!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Grab a controller, and help your friends to face through a world full of chaotic rumble and have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p><em>Main menu &amp; character customization</em><br/>Left stick: Move cursor<br/>Right stick: Rotate character<br/>Bottom face button (A/Cross): Press menu button/Add player<br/>Left face button (X/Square): Change windup key<br/>Upper face button (Y/Triangle): Change head ornament<br/>Start:\u00a0Start game</p>\n<p><em>Minion</em><br/>Left stick: Move<br/>Bottom face button (A/Cross): Jump<br/>Left\u00a0face button (X/Square): Punch<br/>Upper face button (Y/Triangle): Pick up/drop<br/>Right face button (B/Circle): Dash<br/>Right bumper (RB/R1): Throw goo<br/>Start: Pause menu &amp; Instructions</p>\n<p><em>Brain</em><br/>Left stick: Move cursor<br/>Bottom face button (A/Cross): Activate traps &amp; turrets</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>BrainPower was developed during 6 weeks at Futuregames game development school by these people:</p>\n<p>Bj\u00f6rn Fritzon - Product owner, gameplay design, sound design.<br/>Eric Richardson - Art direction, character art.<br/>Johannes Ekholm - Environment art, prop art.<br/>Joji Santhosh - Environment art, prop art.<br/>Josef Gustavsson - Narrative design.<br/>Maximilian Treven - Gameplay design, FX.<br/>Petra Aderlund - Environment art, prop art.<br/>Sebastian Lian - Level design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d3c30873579a7e705494c6c6c62e6b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Memorymatic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
