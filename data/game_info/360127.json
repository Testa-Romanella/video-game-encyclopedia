You're a treasure hunter, going through the catacombs to find the most valuable treasure -- <strong>except you only have one inventory slot</strong>! </p>\n<p>Each item has their own in-game value and weight. The heavier the treasure, the slower you run! Balance finding the rarest of treasures with making it out in time!\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Move\r\n<strong>Left Shift</strong> - Inventory</p>\n\r\nThoughts\r\n<p>This game was very fun to make! This was my first time participating in a game jam. Due to time constraints, I didn't get the chance to implement everything I wanted to put into the game, and there's definitely bugs. However, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Kevin Quan - Game design, programming, additional art</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Art:</strong><br/>16x16 DungeonTileset II - 0x72 - https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8dd/8dd69d29d3efeb35ef3e35f86a2e70bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Quan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
