{"id": 159216, "slug": "scoundrel", "name": "Scoundrel", "name_original": "Scoundrel", "description": "<p>Scoundrel is a single player rogue-like card game for use with a standard deck of playing cards. It was developed by Zack Gage and Kurt Bieg for Train Jam 2011.</p>\n<p>This is a Haxe-Flixel powered port that defies the idea that you don't need a device to play it :P</p>\n<p>The game only enforces the rules but does really little for you if you don't understand how to play.</p>\n<p>You get a Room from the deck. A room are 4 cards. To move to the next room you can either face the room (pick 3 cards) or run (shuffle and get 4 new cards), but you can't run from two rooms in a row.\u00a0Hearts will heal you for the face value. Diamonds are weapons that hit for the face value. Black cards\u00a0(Clubs and Spades) are enemies.\u00a0 The damage you take from an enemy is the difference between your weapon value and the enemy face value (Your fists count as a zero value). Be careful, using your weapon on an enemy makes it duller and it can only kill an enemy with a lower face value than the previous one.<br/></p>\n<p>The (official?) rules can be found here.<br/>http://www.stfj.net/art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game was made on 2012, when I came back to game making after my C# smartphone app phase, looking through my external drive I found the Haxe sources and decided to upload it here to start making some sort of portfolio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3cebec6fc3ba80b3208747c55d04ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Elemental Code"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
