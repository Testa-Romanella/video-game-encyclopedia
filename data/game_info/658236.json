Ink lets me explore that idea easily and simply, cutting straight to the actual content I want to express rather than getting bogged down by mechanics or visuals.</p>\n<p>The story isn't complete; only half of the experience is present: the actual hunting. I will expand this story out over time to include the reasons for you hunting and the real questions behind whether you should be hunting at all.</p>\n\n<p>Cover image from:\u00a0https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/begeloccupywoods</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T07:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd02cd44b7a5f19f95f70c8dbb38d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["igd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
