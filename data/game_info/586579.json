Let's make some egg tarts today and have an \"Eggcellent Start\"! From buying ingredients, to packing your tarts into a nice gift box, you'll be experiencing the joy of making this delicious snack through fun minigames.</p>\n<p>As my very first game made with Unity, the main purpose of this game is to help me get familiar with the game engine and\u00a0coding. For instance, the memory game has helped me practice using lists in C# while the packing scene requires me to apply my fundamental knowledge of UI in Unity, like the drag and drop function.</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for stopping by. Any feedback would be appreciated as it'll surely encourages me or help me improve in my future projects. &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052f7ca1897c933a79ff382abf4b7e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silent Knight Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
