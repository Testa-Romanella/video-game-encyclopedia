Both eras are significant periods of socio-political unrest in Britain and there are distinct similarities and differences across the two stories. The viewer must make decisions in a bid to better understand and escape their captor. However, it soon becomes apparent that not only the life of the protagonist hinges on these decisions, but also the lives of others.<br />\nThis live-action (FMV) game/interactive film features:<br />\n- Choice-based mechanics including 150 decision paths and 18 unique endings.<br />\n- Relationship-tracking mechanic which affects wider story in various ways.<br />\n- Success/fail tracking of sub-plots with supporting characters which affect wider story in various ways.<br />\n- Two game modes \u2013 \u2018Timed Choices\u2019 for a more immersive, pressured experience &amp; \u2018Paused Choices\u2019 for group play / audience participation during live streams.<br />\n- Renowned acting talent, including Anna Popplewell (&#39;The Chronicles of Narnia&#39;) and George Blagden (&#39;Vikings&#39; &amp; &#39;Versailles&#39;) as the two leads.<br />\nAdditionally, Paul Raschid - the writer-director, is one of the world&#39;s most prolific creatives in the live-action (FMV) video game genre.
