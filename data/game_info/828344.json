What a better way to show this than inflating yourself with air to the size of a blimp and play the game in that state? Have fun floating through\u00a0the skies of Acme Acres!</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0How to play</p>\n<p>\u00a0Move balloon-like inflated Babs in all directions with the D-pad (arrow keys on keyboard)</p>\n<p>\u00a0Pick up all the carrots you see, while avoiding the moving spikeballs that were thown at you by the rats. At the bottom left of the screen you can see the amount of\u00a0carrots left to collect in order to advance to the next area. If you are touched by a spikeball, the area restarts and you have to pick all the carrots again. 8 levels in total, and a small ending</p>\n\n<p>Controls (keyboard):</p>\n<p>\u00a0(in short, arrow keys to move and \"X\" key from keyboard to advance text or start game)</p>\n<p>\"Q\" key works as Gameboy's Start button: Starting game from title screen, pausing the game during gameplay</p>\n<p>\"X\" key works as Gameboy's A button: Advance text when displayed, or select an option from the pause menu</p>\n<p>Arrow keys as Gameboy's directions from the D-pad: Move balloon Babs during gameplay or select an option in the pause menu</p>\n<p>\"W\" key works as Gameboy's Select button: You can press it during title screen to restart the intro cutscene</p>\n<p>\"Z\" key works as Gameboy's B button: skip cutscenes if pressed at key moments</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0How to skip Intro cutscene or game start cutscene:</p>\n<p>Method 1 (only for intro cutscene)<br/></p>\n<p>Before the intro cutscene starts, while the Tiny Toon logo is still being displayed, press START (\"Q\" key on the keyboard)</p>\n<p>Method2</p>\n<p>Hold either B or Start (\"Z\" or \"Q\" on the keyboard) as you advance the text with the A button (\"X\" on keyboard). It's done this way because GB Studio cannot do a button check as dialogue text is being displayed. Works on both the intro cutscene and the game start cutscene</p>\n\n<p>Gameboy game made with GB Studio 3.0.3 by Chris Maltby. Very useful and practical software!</p>\n<p>Has joystick support.
