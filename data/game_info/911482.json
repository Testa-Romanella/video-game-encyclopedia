You can move them around using either WASD + arrows, WASD and mouse, or the thumbsticks on a controller. Your goal is to dodge and capture enemies for as long as you can. As you progress through the levels, the game will become more like a bullet hell. Luckily you can upgrade and unlock new features to help you along the way. If you can clear level 25 you are exceptional in the eyes of this developer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T04:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf032c19694d31a199c3917309e2e299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anonymous Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anonymous Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
