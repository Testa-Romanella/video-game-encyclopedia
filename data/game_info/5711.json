{"id": 5711, "slug": "the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing", "name": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing", "name_original": "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing", "description": "<p>The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an action RPG with elements of the hack and slash genre and the first part of the trilogy of the same name. It tells the story of Van Hellsing\u2019s son who continues his father\u2019s work and kills monsters on the streets of the fictional Borgova city. There he fights against a cult that spoils the life of civilians.<br />\nYou can develop the hunter&#39;s skills and upgrade his weapon and magic possession. Van Helsing Junior also has an ally, a ghost named Catherine who helps him in battles. Depending on your choice how to upgrade her, she can be a tank or a healer. The variety of weapons is not very huge; however, there are several ways to customize your character cosmetically.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nWhile the developers took inspiration from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, the game only slightly reminds of this novel. However, they successfully caught the atmosphere of a little 19th-century town and filled it with deep NPCs and interesting technological details.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2013-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:34:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3c3/3c363e31f4add887affadc82c641de72.jpg", "website": "http://www.neocoregames.com/games/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing/overview/", "rating": 3.42, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 158, "owned": 2744, "beaten": 141, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 121, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 226, "ratings_count": 317, "suggestions_count": 670, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 317, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NeocoreGames"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
