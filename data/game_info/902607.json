Made specifically for the <strong>7dfps GameJams (2022)</strong> with the goal of understanding any issues players may encounter in my game and how I can improve my video game development skills.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The UI design is basic, the way to shoot is simple and maybe a bit boring, but in general I tried to give the players a pleasant state after the game. The game offers the possibility to change the sensitivity of the mouse in order not to create discomfort during the game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>If you liked the game, then you can follow me both on my itch.io page and on Instagram.
