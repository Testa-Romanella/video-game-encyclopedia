Realms of Ancient War", "description": "<h3>The story</h3>\n<p>The continent inhabited by people, elves and gnomes lived in peace. Four kingdoms located on four sides of the world could always find a common language. Now in these lands chaos reigns. For twenty years, the war devoured the lives of everyone it could reach until the King of the North invited the leaders of other kingdoms to come together and end the meaningless deaths. The Temple of Heroes was chosen as a place to negotiate a truce was established. But something happened and all the kings, never returned home with signs of disease and the King of the North just disappeared. </p>\n<h3>The gameplay and the plot</h3>\n<p>We have the opportunity to manage the characters of three classes in the genre hack-and-slash RPG. Each of the classes has its own game mechanics. Depending on which of the heroes player chooses - mage, warrior or hunter, the starting location is different. The linear plot and linear hero upgrading might seem confusing at first but the locations themselves and the story, allow you to feel the scale of the game world. Another positive aspect is the possibility of cooperative play, and you can not only play on the network, but also on one computer with a split screen.</p>\n<p>The developer of the game is the French company Wizarbox, which, in addition to creating its own fantasy worlds, was engaged in porting other games on the console Xbox and PlayStation.</p>", "metacritic": 46, "released": "2012-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-21T08:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e1/6e18dbf24c543054865fcb6c45b32684.jpg", "website": "http://www.raw-thegame.com", "rating": 2.2, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 1078, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 23}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 54, "suggestions_count": 334, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
