Maybe they will be happy that I\r\n found them.\u00a0Until then, this garden looks a bit run down, maybe I should get to work.\"\r\nAbout the game\r\n<p><em>Potion Commotion</em> is a cute farming game where you grow plants to gather resources and using those resources to brew magical potions with unique abilities. On the way, you will find torn out pages from your master <em>Ardon Silvera</em> that provide more details on the plants, the potion, the garden and what happened to them.</p>\n<p>The game is quite straight forward. You click on seeds from your inventory and place them on a watered field. Fields can be watered with the Potion of Hydration, which can be made in the cauldron with 5 pieces of a Hydroangea flower. If you're ever confused, simply refer to the game's journal.</p>\n<p>This is just the basics. The game has a 'How to play' section in the menu and the game will guide you along the way.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>10 plants to grow</li><li>15 different unique potions to brew</li><li>3 unique background music loops</li><li>30 pages in an in-game journal</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Day/night cycle</li><li>Movable barrels for your items</li><li>A small storyline</li></ul>\r\nHeart edition?\r\n<p>This is the <em>Heart Edition</em> of Potion Commotion made by\u00a0Jas \ud83d\udc96 as part of a game jam with my gf\u00a0Kamilla's Rainbow.
