Don't worry, snAIk can provide you a slithery pal to eat your fruits with!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Just remember not to let him touch you. Don't ask.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys / A &amp; D / the joystick to turn the <strong>darker</strong> snake<strong>\u00a0</strong>left and right. Collect fruit to grow both you and your\u00a0<strong>lighter</strong>\u00a0AI partner and increase your score. Don't let yourself and the AI collide, or get too far away from each other.</p><p>Contrary to traditional snake, you can pass over yourself since this just complements this gameplay better. If I choose to update in future, I plan to add a 'classic mode' with 90* turning and self-collision.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4913a7cbea0c6dfe1d412f21ef4de0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrFGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
