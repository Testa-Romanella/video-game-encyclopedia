Unfortunately the decision to stow away for free in the cargo hold turned out to be the worst decision he'd ever made. During a terrible storm the cargo doors of the plane blew open and Ratty and his suitcase tumbled out of the plane. Ratty parachuted to safety but his tat (aka. luggage) had been scattered all over the city.</p>\n<p>He'd never visited London before but now Ratty was required to explore every nook and cranny of the huge capital in an effort to recover all of his lost items. Not great timing as his tummy was rumbling and he was so very hungry, having not had chance to scoff an airport meal, being a stow away and all.</p>\n<p>Can you help Ratty recover all his luggage before the poor mite pops his clogs due to cheez needz?</p>\n<p>The Game</p>\n<p>Rat-a-Tat is a tiny sprite platform game where you must go on several sorties through London looking to find your lost luggage, avoiding various nasties and keeping your tummy topped up with enough cheez to last till the end of each trip.</p>\n<p>Don't worry if you miss any items as you can always visit the same areas along another search route. Don't forget you are a tough cookie but also a terrible swimmer with a weakness for cheez.</p>\n<p>The Controls</p>\n<p>Q=Left, W-Right, Space-Jump.
