Hypoxia, put simply, means low oxygen.\u00a0The higher you go, the faster you lose oxygen.\u00a0 Getting oxygen bottles is critical to your survival.\u00a0 Other objects in the game cause other forms of hypoxia, so it is crucial to stay away from them, as they will also lower your oxygen levels.\u00a0 There are also good objects that, when hit, will allow you to soar to new heights and beat your high score!\u00a0 Don't hesitate, see how high you can go!<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0started creating Hypoxia\u00a0because my best friend was passing away from cancer.\u00a0 Our way to bond was to play video games together, so when he couldn't play anymore I\u00a0decided that I\u00a0wanted to dedicate a game to him.\u00a0 Full disclosure - Hypoxia is the first game I've ever created.\u00a0 I\u00a0am\u00a0 grateful that I was able to make a game that I\u00a0believe he would have been proud of, though I\u00a0wish he could have seen the final product.\u00a0 He passed away on\u00a0\u00a012 October 2019. \u00a0The music you hear in the game is a recording of\u00a0him playing his handpan and other instruments.\u00a0\u00a0There's more about our story in the\u00a0\"About\" section of the game.\u00a0 He also created a website shortly before he passed away if you're interested in reading his message.\u00a0\u00a0The link to his website\u00a0is:\u00a0https://soonerratherthanlater.com/</p>\n<p>I\u00a0want to say thank you to my wife, Keischa, for allowing me to invest so much time into this project.\u00a0 Balancing family, work, school, and this project was a lot to take on at one time and I\u00a0couldn't have done it without her - my wife, my soul mate, and my game tester.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I\u00a0want everyone to know\u00a0that I plan on continuing to make games in the future.\u00a0 While the situation that led me to creating Hypoxia wasn't ideal by any means, I\u00a0found a passion I\u00a0never knew I\u00a0had.\u00a0 I\u00a0look forward to your comments and support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:19:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baf/baf32af90c522898d9ee7add5f432c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaleStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
