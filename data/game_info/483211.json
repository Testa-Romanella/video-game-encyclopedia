In Ancient Uprising you take control of an elite operative tasked with infiltrating and destroying a rebellion which plans to destroy modern humanity. You must use resources found on the battlefield in order to become powerful enough to destroy the supernatural forces summoned by the rebellion.\u00a0 The enemies become more bullet stormy as the game progresses, so I hope you've practiced dodging bullets. The style of music contrast to the style of the sound effects, representing modern technology and ancient magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by BAMBanam, Sledge, and Kletiz for the 61st Mini Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8e8b0f3be2718fab78e92e9fb40b872.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zaplee"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
