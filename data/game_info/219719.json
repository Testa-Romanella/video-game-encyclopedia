To help to win games, you can use hints, undos and even shuffle all of the deck and face-down cards to get unstuck when you have no more moves. See if you can complete all 20 scenes!<br/><br/>The cards are designed to make them easy to see on devices ranging from large iPads to small iPhones. You can move cards by dragging them, tapping once to select and then again to place, or by double-tapping to move them to the most likely spot.
