I have made one patch to the game which fixes this, but to play the patched version you will either have to download the desktop version, or use this alternate link to play the web version. Nothing else about the gameplay was changed, so I suggest you play that version of the game instead of the build embedded above.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Shift (or right click) to dash</li><li>Left click to fire lasso towards cursor</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong><em>Garuda Ramuda</em></strong> - Art, Programming, Boss design, Level design</p>\n<p><strong><em>KP</em></strong> - Programming, Sound, Music, Level design</p>\n<p><strong><em>Noah Ataya</em></strong> - Additional assets<br/><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T08:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/625/6256f18097f89c5b54bf7cdb15918f13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
