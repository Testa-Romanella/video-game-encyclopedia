You have a limited time to do so, and each item brought to the heart gives you more time <br/></p>\n<p>The game challenges you with several puzzle-like rooms, where you have to manage the little time you have to collect the items in the right order.<br/></p>\n<p>According to the rules of the Compo format, all the game and the assets were made by me, during the first 48 hours of the jam.</p>\r\nHow do you play it?\r\n<p>The way you want. The game is compatible with WASD, Arrow keys and gamepads. Simply move the character like in any other game! You can pick up the items by walking on them and give them to the heart by colliding with it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Thank you</em></strong> if you played the game! This is my first Ludum Dare submission for the compo format, so it means a lot that you decided to try my game! :) Thank you very much!<br/></p>\r\nChangelog\r\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug making the music restart if losing on level one.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:24:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f02/f022709fcf62c4f5fb28778cec3b343f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sticmac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
