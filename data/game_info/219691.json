Simply tap on the screen to set your power and swing at the pitch. <br/>You can keep hitting home runs until you get ten \"outs\" -- misses or any hit that isn't a home run. <br/>This is a great game for adults and kids. It is especially fun to pass around and see who can get the most home runs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c502d0292ae49ae2e62afdf34b7aaeb7.jpg", "website": "http://clevermedia.com/iphonegames/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["CleverMedia"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["CleverMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
