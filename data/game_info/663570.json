You play as a dumb ass lining up for......?!</p>\n<p>It's a lining up simulator. You can just lining up or try to do something else (interesting) while lining up.\u00a0 Feel free to tell us how many interesting stuff/Easter eggs you have found! (I thing you may need\u00a0 explanations of some of them :D)<br/></p>\n<p>p.s. We haven't dealt with localization yet, so just enjoy the beautiful traditional Chinese at every ending!
