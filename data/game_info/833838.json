The difficulty\u00a0will gradually increase based on the score you got. The further you progressed, the more frequently the block waves\u00a0will spawn, so it might be a challenge later on.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is also my <strong>first project</strong> on the game making career, which is my dream since I was a middle school boy.\u00a0I'm still learning about game engine and other related stuff so it might seem like a very basic game, but I'm\u00a0happy with how it turned out and worth the time as well as the effort I spent on it.</p>\n\n<p>The game comes with different downloadable files for different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), so choose the correct one for your system.</p>\n<p>Finally, I'm hoping that you'll enjoy it and I'll be glad to hear your feedback and opinion for improvement.</p>\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n<ul><li>An endless runway, the game only ends if you collide with the obstacles or fall off the edges.</li><li>3 different camera angles to fit your style.</li><li>A high score system to display and store\u00a0your best.</li><li>6 difficulty levels, starts with the easiest one and gradually increases if you reach a specific score threshold.</li><li>A relaxing and chill music.</li></ul>\r\nDOWNLOAD &amp; INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<p>For Windows, download the setup file that compatible with your system, then run it and proceed through the installation.\r\n</p>\n<p>For Linux and macOS, simply download the zipped file, extract its content and run the game directly.</p>\r\nMUSIC CREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Song: </strong>Adrift Among Infinite Stars.</p>\n<p><strong>Author:</strong> Scott Buckley</p>\n<p>www.scottbuckley.com.au</p>\n<p><strong>Music promoted by:</strong> Chosic</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p><strong>License:\u00a0</strong>Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T08:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e8ab04649247a337e68bde23e43dd6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CST Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
