There are currently only 2 stages right now since the game is still in development and isn't fully ready (More will be added soon in future updates and all that stuff) (After all this is the first game I've made so please enjoy it and leave a comment what I should add)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T06:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/ceb7700716bda019f0b36addd409e3db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ykDarenPlays"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
