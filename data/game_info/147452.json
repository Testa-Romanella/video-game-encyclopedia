Zombies are killed when a wave of their matching color hits them.  Your 4 on stage speakers are your life bar.  Don't let the zombies near them until the end of the song to survive!</p><p>A game I pitched and helped create as part of the Global Game Jam 2017! The theme was \"waves\" and in the game, you play a bassist with the power to clear waves of your zombie fanbase at your show. I worked with 3 other talented individuals I met at the Jam and finished the game in 48 hours. Song was provided by Tree of Audio who setup camp at the Game Jam.</p><p>I've always wanted to make a rhythm game and this was an opportunity to learn how to do that in a short amount of time.<br/></p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Thomas Hyman - Programming</p><p>Adrian Sotomayor - Programing, Art, Sound</p><p>Sam Kern - Art, Programming</p><p>Mike Bell - Programming</p><p>Andrew Pang - Song</p><p><strong>Global Game Jam 2017 link:</strong></p><p>http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/all-your-bass</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a28/a2865d98920c54697256047dca0cc80c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TacoTruckGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
