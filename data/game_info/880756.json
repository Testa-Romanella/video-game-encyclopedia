Its a exploration seeking game where you have to find chests to increase your score and get into the next level. The levels are pretty desinged and are not too hard or too easy. On top of\u00a0 the chests are in most levels flying glass objects to make it a little bit easier so if you see one a chest is near.\u00a0 Good Luck and Fun!</p>\n<p>If you find bugs or have ideas to improve the game please let me know. I took a lot of work into this so i hope you like it!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0e/c0eb3e01f2e62f0a60b2b20bd7f82f0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vexital"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
