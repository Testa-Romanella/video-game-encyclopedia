The game has a high focus on movement capabilities, and the better you can use the Dash, Boost and Walljump, the better you will do in-game, not using these will make you much slower and less agile than your foe. Use everything to your advantage, and the game will keep you coming back because of its high skill ceiling. As well as being fun with friends, the game will run on virtually any machine because of its simple, yet aesthetically pleasing meshes, textures and environments.</p>\n<p><strong>MULTIPLAYER</strong></p>\n<p>Host matches with your friends, host a server to play against random people, or search for a match with the matching system, or browse for a server that's just right for you.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Daniel Zafrir for his work on the art in this title, and he has helped massively in the development of the game.</p>\r\nPLEASE NOTE!\r\nThis game requires steam to be open to play, if its not open you cannot see or join games\r\n<p>This version is extremely buggy and not finished, the game is also not currently in developement, to respawn after a goal is scored, press R (:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T04:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/5356ab77324459be10f5e7a20c94d307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frinky"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
