The trick to a good curve is to use the brakes to slow down if you are going too fast, and to keep your body in the direction of the turn. Since it is not a car, you cannot drift, but you can experience driving on the edge of the line using the brakes!<br/></p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T07:26:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ca/4cab9c88de832deeb72c3b455581a5e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["asiarai"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
