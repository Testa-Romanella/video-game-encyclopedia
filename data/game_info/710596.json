{"id": 710596, "slug": "dont-leave-it-blank", "name": "Don't Leave It Blank!", "name_original": "Don't Leave It Blank!", "description": "<p>Don't Leave It Blank! is a crossword puzzle game where, unlike crossword puzzles, there are no definitions, only the letters randomly drawn, the time limit, your vocabulary, your own foresight, and finally, the built-in dictionary limits you to complete the grid. (So, quite a lot of things. :) ) The goal of the game is to fill the grid completely in as few turns as possible and to achieve the highest possible score. 100 seconds per turn is available to the player for word formation. The newly placed letters must fall in a line and at the end of each turn only the words in the built-in dictionary may remain on the board.</p>\n<p>You can drag a letter from the rack to a field on the board. Or click on the field of the board where you want to place the first letter of the word you want to drop. An arrow will appear in the square to indicate the direction of the drop. If you click there again, the direction will change from horizontal to vertical, and vice versa. And then click on the letters on the rack in the order in which they follow each other in the word.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:15:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/9786a4ec0d931a3341214905552637dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["betuTboy"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
