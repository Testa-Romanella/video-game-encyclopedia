Good luck!</p><p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Num 1- 3 are the different \"tools\" you can use</p>\n<p>1 - regular blaster</p>\n<p>2 - laser</p>\n<p>3- Teleport(click on red floor tile).</p>\n<p>MOBILE: IT IS SO HARD, I do not recommend playing on mobile play on PC if you can for the best experience. It works great\u00a0but teleport does not work on this platform so gameplay is limited(And harder).</p>\n\n<p>Music Credit: \"Path Of hope\" AleXZavera on pixabay.com</p>\n<p>Music Credit: \"Ghost Coast 2030\" Eidunn on pixabay.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:59:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ef/9eff72069ee2febdb5832223e666e468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thigadoodal2"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
