Sounds like a lot of hoopla, unless you're Benji.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to Where's My Drink? 2, the sequel to our previous highly-loved game, Where's My Drink? Run around<strong> Bonky Bottoms</strong> as <strong>Benji\u00a0\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0a\u00a0shy little cry-baby who is kind of known as the town ditz-\u00a0and try to earn your <em>gosh-darn</em> drink from <strong>Mr. Grabs\u00a0 -\u00a0</strong>the\u00a0greedy money-grubbing lobster and owner of the Salty Seahorse.</p>\n<p>Explore Bonky Bottoms and get acquainted with the locals,\u00a0you never know what you might run into in this town.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This time around, we've added a larger cast to our game. Besides Mr. Grabs and Benji, we have now added:</p>\n<p><strong>Opal</strong>: An air-headed girl who has a knack for inventing things. No one around the town really trusts her antics, as they've seen her past inventions.\u00a0<em>They haven't ended well</em>. Benji does have a soft spot for her though, so be careful about being her next guinea pig.</p>\n<p><strong>Marlon:\u00a0</strong>The soft-voiced blobfish instructor with a huge fascination and knowledge of these fish. If you have questions, he can answer them for you. He knows everything there is to know about blobfish. Somehow he gets past their squishy,\u00a0<em>odd</em> outsides, and sees the beauty within them. (aww how sweet).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Sidney (Sid):\u00a0</strong>The sleep-deprived shop keeper. He has about just everything you'd need to make your house look the best it can. He's got a lot to offer, so long as it isn't a nap. Maybe you should offer him some sleep supplements.</p>\n<p><strong>Arlo:\u00a0</strong>The town snob who has a nark for being super picky about\u00a0<em>everything</em>. It's hard to even get\u00a0 a chuckle out of this guy. He's super uptight! Good luck trying to get on his good side...</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Nora:\u00a0</strong>A loveable little sea-bunny who has a fascination for gardening. She might be small, but don't let that cute face fool you. Be mean to her, and you'll feel her wrath. Just keep an eye out for her kids, they seem to be everywhere!</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Mr. Shrimp:</strong>\u00a0The owner of the Chump Barrel, and enemy of Mr. Grabs. Mr. Shrimp absolutely loves Benji, strictly because Mr. Grabs dislikes him. Is it a bit rude? Maybe. But hey, he can't dislike the same person that that awful lobster does.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Loofah\u00a0Tom:\u00a0</strong>Depressed.<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0Keyboard-</em></strong></p>\n<p>WASD = Move</p>\n<p>Space = Jump (Normal Mode) / Fly (When Flying Pants Active)</p>\n<p>F = Activate Flying Pants</p>\n<p>E = Interact</p>\n<p>Left Click = Activate Catch-Mode</p>\n<p>Right Click (While In Catch-Mode) = Catch</p>\n<p>1, 2, 3, 4 Keys = Select Furinture</p>\n<p>Up Arrow/Down Arrow = Move Furniture</p>\n<p>Left Arrow/Right Arrow = Rotate Furniture</p>\n<p>Right Click (While In Furniture-Mode) = Place Furniture</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0Controller</em></strong><strong><em>-</em></strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Left Analog = Move</p>\n<p>Right Analog = Move Camera</p>\n<p>A Button = Jump</p>\n<p>X = Interact/Activate Flying Pants</p>\n<p>Left Bumper = Activate Catch-Mode</p>\n<p>Right Bumper (While In Catch-Mode)\u00a0= Catch</p>\n<p>D-Pad = Select Furniture</p>\n<p>Right Trigger (While In Furniture-Mode) = Move Furniture Left</p>\n<p>Left Trigger (While In Furniture-Mode) = Rotate Furniture</p>\n<p>R1 = Place Furniture</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing our game!
