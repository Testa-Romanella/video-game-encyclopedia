The world is letter based, for example the ground is made of #.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. The \"Player\"(S) are letters, is the MashUp Jam itself and the enemy or defeat objects are the GMTK Game Jam.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Absolutely messed up controls (but leads to some decent puzzles).</strong></p>\n<p><em>Don't worry it will make sense when you play the game.
