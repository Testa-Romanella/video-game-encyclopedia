{"id": 568266, "slug": "necro-card", "name": "Necro Card", "name_original": "Necro Card", "description": "<p>This game was born out of the idea \"what if moves that are usually totally bad in card games weren't?\". Attacking strong cards with weak cards isn't a failure of a move in this game and can be quite good. Strong cards are no tougher than other cards and playing a card is a bit of a risky move as opposed to attacking.</p>\n<p>You'll be playing against an AI enemy, who tries to outsmart you with good and trashy moves alike. A concise and tutorial is included in the game as well as below on this page. Give it a try!</p>\n\n\r\nRules\r\n<ul><li>whoever reaches 0 energy (\"hp\") first, loses</li><li>if you have no cards on your field at the end of your turn, you lose 2 energy</li><li>in a fight, both cards are destroyed</li><li>cards with equal attack can't fight</li><li>in a fight, if your card's attack is greater, the enemy takes that amount of damage (\"damage enemy\")</li><li>if it is smaller, you gain the energy of your card (\"heal yourself\")</li></ul>\r\nExtra challenge\r\n<p>The game also features a slightly harder variant of the ai. You can encounter it randomly after your first match, but can also force to fight it by holding down the SHIFT key while clicking on the \"play\" or \"restart\" button.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n\n<p>Art, Sounds &amp; Programming by me, Music by Astowo, Font used is\u00a0Nunito, Pallette used is EDG32.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb7bda2b3f031223a9aac61d36f2c51a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EinBurgbauer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
