After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he&#39;s sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.</p>\n<p>Dusty is Rad&#39;s good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn&#39;t what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!</p>\n<p>Rad &amp; Dusty&#39;s adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it&#39;s up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle&#39;s inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.</p>\n<p>Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by.</p>\n<p>Sounds &amp; Music: Composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!</p>\n<p>The Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad &amp; Dusty to continue their journey.</p>\n<p>Classic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect &#39;em all.</p>\n<p>The Radical Edition for the Nintendo Switch system also includes these brand new additions!</p>\n<p>\u2022 2 Player Couch Co-op - Play together with a friend!
