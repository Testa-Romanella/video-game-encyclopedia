The only thing you can do is drive around a smol truck in an isometric landscape. I added collision with the walls and a very clunky sound, so that the engine feels better.</p>\n<p>The first problem I encountered is the sprite number. Currently there are 4 sprites for the truck. In the end there will be probably 8 needed. If you turn the truck right now, it gets a bit weird with the rotation, as I have to turn the sprite a total of 90\u00b0. With 8 sprites, there will be only a 45\u00b0 turn for every sprite which will make driving much better.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4f/d4fe308585fe7b72cc7c21dfe504eb48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KorbohneD"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
