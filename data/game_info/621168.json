The theme was \"joined together\" so I thought it would be fun to make a game where you play a puppeteer and use the puppet cross brace to move the hero around indirectly. A and D moves the world stage to the left and right as well, so there's no direct movement of the player, only indirectly.</p>\n<p>I made this game in\u00a013 hours on Saturday. The game features controller support and subtitles. All music, code, and (bad) narration are from me. Many sound effects and art as well. The rest was found on freesound.org or textures.com. Also using some free fonts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:44:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/288/288e0ebc7b3b2cbf1eb6b2282c353245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EricFreeman"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
