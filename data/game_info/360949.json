From within their infernal prison, they are hunted by creatures of the most horrific type. As such, our hero has one sole desire: <em>to subsist. </em>And will fight tooth and nail to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Our character's continued existence depends on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n<p>When the game is loaded, <em>left click </em>on the games title in the center of the screen, this will begin the game.</p>\n<p>Use the <em>WASD</em> keys\u00a0to <em>move</em> around, and<em> aim</em> with the <em>mouse</em>. Hold\u00a0<em>left click\u00a0</em>to <em>fire</em> at any enemies that spawn.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to rack up as many points as possible before dying.</p>\n<p>If you would like to <em>quit the game</em>, simply <em>right click</em> on the <em>games title</em>.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes / Disclaimers</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made within 48 hours for a game jam, and while every effort has been made to polish the game and provide a solid experience, some bugs and issues may have slipped though the cracks. If any arrise, be sure to post about it and I'll do my best to patch it!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact Me</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: @TomRobsonGames</p>\n<p>Email: tom.robson@tomrobsongames.co.uk</p>\n<p>Website:\u00a0https://www.tomrobsongames.co.uk/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4fcc54d34cd11bf9001d8151f80fd6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TomRobson"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
