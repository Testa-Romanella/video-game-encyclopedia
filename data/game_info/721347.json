A young man where every day is fulfilled by pouring drinks and empty tram rides. Like a descending Autumn leaf, he floats alone in the cold wind. Memories of the past reflect like mirrors, and every time he sees himself, he'll always know. But some mirrors show us a chance to find what we're looking for, and for Natsu, that's the only thing he could have faith in. But will it be the same thing once he finds it, or will this all finally be enough?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fairy Tail Re: Write is a fan-made visual novel to re-imagining the popular anime series Fairy Tail with a new and exciting frame of reference.
