As you cultivate and\u00a0<strong>train the newest generation of young pop stars</strong>, you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted when things go well and who gets reprimanded when things get sour. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always a happy one. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their\u00a0<strong>emotional meltdowns</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>PR nightmares</strong>\u00a0can spell financial disaster for your company.<br/></p>\n<p>It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of\u00a0<strong>gossip magazines</strong>,\u00a0<strong>super fans</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>rival groups</strong>, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest\u00a0<strong>scandal</strong>. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's not personal, it's business.<br/><br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Decide how to\u00a0<strong>deal with crises</strong>\u00a0including gossip, vandalism, stalkers, or threats directed at your agency and the pop idols you manage.</li><li><strong>Manage relationships</strong>\u00a0between the different idols in your group, as you deal with cliques, internal feuds, and bullying.</li><li><strong>Grow your fanbase</strong>\u00a0by varying your tactics and appealing to a wide variety of demographics.</li><li><strong>Produce singles</strong>, hold concerts, organize huge TV events and overseas tours to capitalize on your group's popularity and bring in revenue.</li><li><strong>Develop your agency's building</strong>.
