Is the result beautiful, or horrifying? I don't know, but it's certainly not natural...</p>\n<p>So yeah, you play as Helios - The 'Shooting Star' - trying to raise the sun but being attacked by creatures who want the Sun for themselves. It is essentially a puzzle game, with three bosses that require some thinking to beat.</p>\n<p>With the jam's and general life limitations I haven't been able to make it as user friendly as I'd like, so there are hints inside of most scenes if you read carefully enough. On top of that, I'll toss some general hints below and add to it if people report getting stuck.<br/></p><p>I was going to ham up the bullet hell elements more with some randomisation, a health system, etc. but, you know, time. Instead you get a lot of birds and I hope you have a good imagination<br/></p>\n<p>GENERAL INTERACTIVE FICTION HINTS</p>\n<p>Here's some broad tips if you're new-ish to IF:</p>\n<p>If in doubt, make your first instinct be to 'look at [something]</p>\n<p>At times in Helios, 'talk to [something]' is also a good bet.</p>\n<p>If you need to use an object, you must specify a target. For example 'throw [something] at [someone]'</p>\n<p>To move in a direction, you can either type 'northeast', 'go northeast', or shorten directions to one or two letters like 'ne' for example.</p>\n<p>MORE SPECIFIC HINTS - SPOILERS<br/></p>\n<p>Boss 1: Talk to the fish for a hint. It will mention something related to using anything not being bolted down as a weapon...</p>\n<p>Boss 2: Sometimes success means holding your breath...</p>\n<p>Boss 3: Most things you do will make you look at Friend. You should probably do something that will stop you ever looking at Friend again. Your optician will hate you though...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T03:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af3/af38199faa7fcfa1f0bcaa9bc0a9e4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeyYeh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
