It requires no MP and creates a small projectile that shoots in a straight line towards the monster. If it misses it bounces off the walls and obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>At level 5 the Magic Missile is upgraded and becomes a homing missile, making hitting monsters much easier.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nFireball\r\n<p>Fireball is a more powerful attack that's unlocked at level 2. It consumes 20 MP on use and can be shot over obstacles. It creates a small explosion on hit.</p>\n\n<p>At level 13 the fireball becomes stronger and faster, the explosion it creates grows as well.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nVoid\u00a0\r\n<p>Void is a powerful spell unlocked upon reaching level 8. It requires 60MP to use\u00a0 and\u00a0creates a large explosion that can damage multiple monsters at once.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>At level 22 Void gets a lifesteal effect that makes it heal\u00a0the player by a fraction of the damage dealt.</p>\r\nShield\r\n<p>Shield is a defensive spell unlocked at level 18. It costs 80MP to use and gives the cat 30% armor, which protects it from losing HP while it's up.\u00a0After being upgraded at level 26,\u00a0the spell's potency goes up to 50%.</p>\r\n\r\nGameplay Video", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:56:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90a8d58c36e0f666e91a30261d7315a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rhime"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
