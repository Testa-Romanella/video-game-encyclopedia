You play the role of getting to the stage and performing without getting hurt anymore then you already are! Made in a couple days for Brackey's 2nd game jam with the theme \"Love is Blind\" I took the approach of physically blind, as a result of too much love! XD These are the first cut scenes I have ever made in a game, so go easy, but I hope you enjoy the silliness anyways! :D (Also everything was made in less than a week including models, animations, music, sound effects, audio, UI, and so on.) WARNING: Game is playable online, but not very well, lots of photographers running around with AI, slows down significantly on the third level, the download preforms much better.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85b/85b6aec194f1517c9229400da18c6817.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["IChoMo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
