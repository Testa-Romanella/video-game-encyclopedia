I started working on this since January 2021.<br/>Currently this is just a <strong>demo version </strong>of having just four levels of the original game, I hope you'll like it\u00a0<br/><br/>Story Line &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/></p>\n<p>A girl got stuck in her coaching class , its dark mid night. She feels something paranormal at 2:59am. What will she do now ?? How can she come out of there ??\u00a0And why this things happening in the coaching ?<br/><br/>Metaphor &gt;&gt;<br/><br/>I will not reveal all metaphor now but I would like to say that the game name Coaching Class is itself a metaphor. This game targets the mindset of today's society???\u00a0Every parents wants their kid to be the doctor or an engineer. But wait what if the kid wants to be singer, artist or any thing else.<br/><br/>This game is the creative combination of darkness and the tradition of todays society regarding Coaching Class. This game provides us an idea of state of mind of the student, like what he or she use to feel when he or she\u00a0 is in confusing state of taking admission into Coaching by killing his dreams.<br/>In this game the girl wants to be the singer but she got admission into the coaching.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:21:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5dd7950b82e7a83670fb1e42bc951e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Pulkit Rathore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
