Find your way through dark forests, abandoned villages and a haunted castle. But be aware that not all souls want to pass on peacefully.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by students at The Game Assembly, this game is inspired by platformer giants like Celeste and Ori and the Blind Forest. It is filled with challenges, collectable souls and hidden rooms to explore, but if you want the local speedrun high score you should probably move on quickly.\u00a0 \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T04:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e01b2c0776602868b600f5201b80fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lifeless"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
