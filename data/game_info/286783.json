{"id": 286783, "slug": "partia-3", "name": "Partia 3", "name_original": "Partia 3", "description": "Partia 3 is a SRPG (Strategy Role-playing) video game inspired by Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series. In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.<br/><br/>Partia 3 : The Knight of Partia is the third installment of the Partia series that wraps up the 'Granian Trilogy'. However, the game is designed as a stand-alone set in hundreds of years after the events of Partia 2, hence no knowledge of the prior games is required.<br/><br/>The game includes 30 stages (including 5 hidden stages) that should provide solid 30 plus hours of game play if not 50 or 100.<br/><br/>It is not a graphically good looking game nor has the big sprite animated battles that Fire Emblem games have. UI can be a bit clunky and looks 'meh', in most places at best.<br/><br/>But if there's any labor of love, this must be it. Despite the financial failures of the first two Partia games, I kept on making this game, alone for five years, putting all my free times and vacations into, because frankly I was obsessed about finishing off this thing.<br/><br/>But I've had a lot of fun making it, and I still had more fun playing the game myself. I'm sure you will have some joy out of it, if you are a fan of Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series.<br/><br/>Now mobile game landscape has changed a lot since I started out this journey back in 2011. There are now a lot of quality games in the App store, including a Fire Emblem itself!<br/>I realized a few years ago I no longer served any good value to customers who were looking for a little SRPG experience on mobile. As I'm writing this, Partia 2 sold slightly more than 2K units in 5 years. So obviously this is not a money making venture, of which I hope my next idea is going to be, unlike this Partia thing.<br/><br/>Anyways, the result is a paid game, with no ad, no IAP, and no catch anywhere. I'm not even tracking any data as, frankly I don't see a point in doing that. You see I am already resigned to the fate this little big indie game is for the lovers only.<br/><br/>For The Lovers Only.<br/><br/>So this may be the final time I write a game description on an App Store. Or maybe not.<br/><br/>Whoever you are, I hope you enjoy. If you can, please let me know how you find your experience.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Dustin", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64021977a920252cab7392dde4dae4f_QFZic0Q.jpg", "website": "http://playimago.com/presskit", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Imago Software"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Imago Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
