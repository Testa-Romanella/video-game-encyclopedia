But when a job goes south and you're cursed in a waking sleep, they're going to have to stay united amidst the discord and dark forces that threatens to tear you all apart.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes<br/></strong>\"Frayed\" is a short\u00a0kinetic novel for Android created as a part of NaNoRenO 2022. I wanted to challenge myself to make something imperfect, yet complete. Something with choices that explore not your impact on the world, but the world's impact on you.\u00a0I would like to create my own art for this at some point, but wanted to be realistic with my time constraints. I hope you enjoy it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Created by\u00a0Jimi Bonogofsky<br/>Music by Incompetech<br/>Sprites and Backgrounds from Final Fantasy XIV</p>\n<p><em>(Tested on Android and PC, not tested on Mac)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T02:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77f98e102006368818ce257a7e11629b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Crawlabee Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
