I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve settled into your office by now; hopefully you find it to be the right atmosphere for your assignment. If the listing wasn\u2019t clear enough, here\u2019s your instruction:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Select <em>THREE</em> appropriate candidates best suited for the life and profession of a pirate. You\u2019ll ask them three questions; Try to pay attention to their responses. I don\u2019t want to see any rookies joining a crew where they\u2019ll cause more trouble than good. That being said, you\u2019re the one with an eye for pirates, so I\u2019ll let you roll the dice.\r\n</li><li>Assign each candidate to one of three positions by clicking on its puzzle piece in the top left of your screen: <strong>CAPTAIN</strong>, <strong>FIRST MAT</strong><strong>E</strong>, or <strong>CABIN BOY</strong>. Not everyone is cut out for each role, so some interesting scenarios can always arise depending on who you deem worthy for each position. And remember- as soon as you let somebody go, they\u2019ve already lost the job. No doubtful Debbies.\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Join</strong> your selected trio together to create a successful and smoothly blended gang of outlaws. Updates on their adventures will be formally reported following their assemblage!</li></ol>\r\nKeep in mind that these are potential pirates you're dealing with here. They might try to act like one before they\u2019ve even got the job, so don\u2019t be fooled by any sneaky sea-dweller tricks. The well-being of innocent civilians is at stake, and insurance is always stingy about covering \u201cdestruction-by-pirate\u201d cases. <strong>Good luck, sailor, and\u2026 try not to screw this up.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n<em>- The Boss</em>\r\n\r\n------\r\nCreated by IDRASIDAN GAMES in 48 hours for the team's first game jam!
