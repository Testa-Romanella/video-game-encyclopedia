The artificial intelligence for the computer manager was provided by Baseball Hall of Fame member Earl Weaver, then manager of the Baltimore Orioles. EWB was a major hit, and along with John Madden Football helped pave the way for the EA Sports brand, which launched in 1992.</p>\n<p>Daglow and Dombrower had previously teamed together to create Intellivision World Series Baseball at Mattel in 1983, the first video game to use multiple camera angles and the first console sports sim.</p>\n<p>Daglow and Dombrower interviewed Weaver in his hotel room in a series of meetings over a period of months during the 1985 season for managerial AI. Dombrower actually apologized to Weaver at one point for taking up so much of his free time, but Weaver told him that he never had anything to do during road trips and never left his hotel room anyway. In addition, he loved talking baseball strategy, and he was having a great time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/901ecc65ec6e54ae24675ad49be5c574.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Classic Macintosh", "Apple II", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Don Daglow", "Eddie Dombrower"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
