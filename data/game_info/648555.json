In a nutshell you have to pick up speed in order to beat the track before your time runs out; you also have to destroy various obstacles in your way and collect weapon upgrades.\r\nThis game was never made into a title by Bullfrog and was released as a freeware game.\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nSource code (decompiled): https://github.com/rep-stosw/tube-game-dos<br/>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\n1,2 - Player Select\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nEsc - Exit\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nQ - Forward / Accelerate\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nA - Backward / Reverse\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nO - Left\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nP - Right\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSpacebar - Shoot\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nEnter - Bomb", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:41:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/114a7e76fb52ad21b0ee1383927ec6d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["clobberasm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
