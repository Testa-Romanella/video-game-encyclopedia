There are two pictures on the left and right in each level. On the right side of the level interface, there is a hint that how many differences between the two pictures and how many differences have been found. Click on the different points in any picture, and a green circle appears to indicate that the correct search has been made. If there is a difference, an error symbol indicates that it is incorrect. Find all the differences within the time limit to complete the level tasks. It's very difficult, it's really boring!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T03:47:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d161146e6d6db04116ebf93c0156fd45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEV  Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["DEV  Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
