You become a parent, responsible for feeding your children... You need to feed them but they must not overeat! Also, check if any of them is not so hungry to die!</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>The game is simple. You need to keep the children alive for specific amount of time.<br/>Click on a child to feed it. On the left side of each child there is a progress bar. It indicates hungry level. If it's too much... well see yourself ;) If it falls to 0, the child dies...</p>\n<p>There are 10 levels.
