Use Q and aim at objects to transform into them (not all objects can be used as a disguise).\u00a0 Try disguising as the nearest chair or plant. It is easier to aim at objects in first person mode.\u00a0 Use E to revert back into the character to navigate the scene easily.\u00a0 Laying bait while running is more effective to let the treats reach the cats faster before they can get away.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Q - Disguise\r\n</p>\n<p>E - Change back from disguise\r\n</p>\n<p>Right mouse button - Lay bait</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump</p>\n<p>V - Change camera view<br/></p>\n<p>Credit:<br/></p><p>Project Nature, \u201cinteractive stylized Lowpoly Grass\u201d Available at: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/cbd105d87a794bb5a35d5916bad7...</p>\n<p>PolyArt3D, \u201cIsometric \u2013 Interiors\u201d Available at: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/9549f70180d94d11be21b01003b9...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unreal4, \u201cUnreal Mannequin\u201d Available from unreal (Accessed 2021)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d54/d54c15edf4b70bc07860e972a427f23b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zahramiah"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
