Once the humans are caught they are shaved and stripped of their clothes <br/>to be teleported to the UFO.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/>Abduction Bit is a retro style game inspired by 80s arcade games like Bubble Bobble and Mario Bros, where players take control of an alien that must abduct the humans.<br/>To complete a stage the players must capture all the humans without touching them and must avoid dangerous traps. <br/>The player can jump on the platform and shoot - easy gameplay with high-level difficulty.<br/><br/><strong>Level Packs system:</strong><br/>In Abduction Bit the player can select various level packs through the main menu.
