The interactions you have with each treasure hunter either widen or narrow your odds of surviving each interaction, so be careful with your dialogue choices!</p>\n<p><em>(Devnote: The game fits the jam limitation of \"contrasting ideas/themes\" by presenting the player with a prisoner's dilemma-esque situation: work together with the other treasure hunters and receive less treasure, or lie/kill the others for a chance to gain all the treasure. Negative actions increase the chances that others will use negative actions on you, however, as the others will come to fear/mistrust you. Note that this has been partially implemented...the gameplay is there, it's just not as smooth as I'd like.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys - side-to-side movement</li><li>X - jump</li><li>C - dash</li><li>Enter - interact</li></ul>\n<p>In the full version (to be released sometime in the future), the plot of the game will be more fully fleshed out. Right now the main goal of the game is to see how long you can survive...and since I didn't get much playtesting in, I'm going to assume it's far more easy than it should.</p>\n<p>All graphical assets were made by me, taking obvious inspiration from ancient Egyptian art. Music is from \"Urban Slow Piano Vol. I,\" \"Bad Day,\" will give proper credit when game is done. Background soundscape is from \"Soundscapes - Underworld\", \"Thaumaturge's Tomb.\" Made in RPG Maker MV.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\"Randomly-assigned\" conversations tend to repeat. Like, a lot.</li><li>Sometimes enemies won't die.</li><li>Weird graphical glitch in the first rooms where a character's ankles/feet will be slightly translucent for no discernable reason, though this will be fixed after one interaction.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:52:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54c/54c760ef6015554bb0ea5d461f4d270c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cormorant42"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
