In order to survive you have to harvest humans. But in order to eat - eh - harvest them you have to kill first. But be careful:\u00a0they will fight back.</p>\n<p>Harvesting a human has some positive effects:</p>\n<ol><li>It will heal you</li><li>It will reset the starving bar</li><li>It will give you points</li></ol>\n<p>So harvest as much as possible to raise your final score!</p>\r\nStarving System\r\n<p>If the starving bar runs out it will apply 1 damage-point to you. Also the starving rate will increase by a little. So you really want to avoid that the bar runs down to zero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As mentioned above: you can reset the starving bar by harvesting (eating) humans. But you also can affect the system in negative way. Attack and running will let you starve more!</p>\r\nHumans\r\n<p>There are 4 different types of humans. They have individual health, damage, attack-speed\u00a0and points. You can easily distinct them by there model.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If they are easy to kill then of course they give less points/health.</p>\n<p>Hint: Friendly fire is ON. So humans can kill each other!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W/A/S/D (or arrow keys) - Move<br/>E - Harvest\u00a0(eat)<br/>Shift - Run<br/>Space - Attack</p>\n<p>The game has an auto-aim-mechanic. So you only need to be close enough to an human. Hitting the attack-key will make you face the target before the actual attack triggers.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Asset pack used in game:\u00a0Simple apocalypse (Synty)<br/>Background-Music in city from:\u00a0joelsteudler.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T17:19:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a88940d64ab12876c6e841a887f85020.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
