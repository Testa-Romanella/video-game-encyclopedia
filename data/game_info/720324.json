This was my first game ever, developed in\u00a0Unity in the course of a single week, using my skills in\u00a0C# and all of that while learning design concepts (that's why the design is so simple). My purpose was to build a 100% working game without game breaking bugs, and here it is.\u00a0</p><p>This is the prototype of a game, and while the premise\u00a0is simple it can be quite challenging.\u00a0I implemented difficulty based on points, so the more points you have, the more difficult it gets.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The question isn't if you will die in this game, trust me, you will, the real question is how far can you get?</strong></p>\n<p>___________________________</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Destroy enemies, manage your remaining bullets and get the most points.</p>\n<p>___________________________\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay Features\r\n<ul><li><strong>2 different enemy types:</strong>\u00a0raging from the Brutos, a red block that will follow you and be constantly in your way, to the purple Viper, a rectangule that will shoot from a distance, and when you try to get closer... she just might run away!</li><li><strong>Increasingly difficult:</strong> the more points you get, the more enemies will spawn.\u00a0Simple as that.</li><li><strong>Manage your bullets</strong>: you could be shooting everywhere... except not! You have limited bullets to increasingly difficult enemies spawning around you. It's up to you how you use your attacks!</li></ul>\n<p>___________________________</p>\r\nNotes\r\n<ul><li><strong>This is a prototype,</strong>\u00a0with one functional level and two different enemies.</li><li>The initial idea was a simple arena where you battle enemies.</li><li>I have countless concepts that I want to bring to this game, such as power-ups, abilites, reworked designs, sound, pause menu, and many more.</li><li>I hope you guys enjoy this game, while simple, it was my first game ever, so I'm very proud of it.</li><li><strong>Share your scores!</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you all!</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:02:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24390133702d05a9748de1382b34ee39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mystery"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
