The idea was to escape a planet that was flooding due to constant rain, so the land was running out of space.\u00a0 I wanted to make something where the rain sounds contributed to a nice atmosphere, and I also wanted it to convey a sense of loneliness\u00a0 I went for a fixing up an old spaceship, which was an idea I liked a lot.\u00a0 I didn't really have time during the 72 hours to really do it justice, but I'm happy with the atmosphere and audio of the game.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>KEYBOARD - Use the Arrow Keys to Move, and Space Bar to Ibteract<br/>\r\n\t GAMEPAD \u2013 Use the Left Stick to Move, and the A Button to Interact</p>\n<p>As the game's focus was atmosphere, there isn't any real challenge in the gameplay.\u00a0 Just explore the surrounds and interact/pick-up things that look useful.\u00a0 When inside the ship, yellow blinking lights should help identify what you need to interact with next to progress the story.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t?\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<strong>JAMES</strong>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>SMITH</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt Support\r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt &amp; Design<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/0695589407946f0a6a07c2e679b97e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
