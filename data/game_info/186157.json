From an aquarel painting I have extracted basic defining lines, through which I have built a surface of a 3D digital terrain. On which I had assigned texture in form of the prime aquarel painting. After that I have added a controllable camera and thus the terrain becomes a landscape, which observer \u2013 becoming an active participant \u2013 walk through and discovers the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I wanted to create space, that wouldn't be accessible for humans in any other way than through digital media. And this landscape build from little aquarel painting is the example. I want to make you feel the atmospere of abstract landscape, as I've intended. Is seems to that this is the most direct way how to connect with other people through art. I don't necessarily need you to underestand everything about my work, but I need you to feel it and try living it, even for a moment. And so I think, this makes it way more relateable. That's what I want, to connect with people through atmospheres and their own feeling they develop in given atmosphere.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d2651121832f6d0fe50581ad2b5b6de6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moonlight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
