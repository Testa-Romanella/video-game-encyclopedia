And because of people's ignorance, this virus has gotten out of control. Parkour away from all different types of zombies in a completely changed world. Will you be able to run away? Or will you meet the fate of countless others?</p>\n<p>This game was created for the My First Jame: Summer 2020 event.\u00a0 This game is a platformer and the goal of it is to avoid different types of zombies. The theme of this Jam was \"change\". I thought, \"What's more changed then our own daily lives right now?\" So a virus-themed game came to mind!</p>\n<p>I used this experience to learn and experiment with\u00a0coding, specifically enemy AIs (patrolling enemies on platforms, enemies that chased and avoided you, etc.). With the certain circumstances in this world, I also tried to give this game a message: stay safe and wear your masks. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Game, character art, zombie art, and platform art made by me.</p>\n<p>Title art by Snowy_Oshawott#7640</p>\n<p>Background art by Standard Human #3414</p>\n<p>Music by Chopy61#4413</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/178/178e90812aec1b3e3ecb9a3f75cdfcb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jteaaa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
