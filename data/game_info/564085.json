You just got a job in the one and only Hero's Journey Agency, whose objective is to let people experience a\u00a0<em>miniature</em> version of the Hero's journey.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I play?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to complete a full week of work. A successful day will allow you to continue to the next. If you were to fail, you would have to repeat the day, being stuck in a \"loop\" of sorts<em> *cough* *cough*</em>.</p>\n<p>The clients, (or Heroes\u2122) will want to experience different parts of the journey. Each day a new step of the journey will be added. In order to let them <em>experience</em> the amazing step, you will have to enter with them in the corresponding room.</p>\n<p> But beware! You can just be in one place at a time, and the clients have limited patience! You will have to be careful with how you manage your time! Clients will wait for you in an <em>ordered</em> queue until they're just too frustrated. You can only let some clients leave each day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technical aspect<br/></strong></p>\n<p>We used a tool made by the one and only Aitor Iribar which allowed us to mix traditional 3D animations with ragdoll and physics, which created these majestic \"potatoes\" of clients.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T07:29:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b119dda831f71cff868ad8d497df11c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aitor Iribar", "KE Studio", "Pablo Mart\u00ednez"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
