Well... All we can offer you is sucking animals' souls and toxic workplace relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Fantasy Pet Shop is a 1st Person Shop-keeping Puzzle game, playable on Windows PC and in VR on Oculus Quest 2. You only have to look after the Owner's Fantasy Pet Shop for 10 minutes. It's The Great Plague, people are desperate for animal company and it's your job to get it to them. Deliver cards filled with the souls of animal through a pneumatic tube to fulfill the orders. The Shop Owner only has 3 rules:</p>\n<p>1. Don't touch the animals<br/>2. Don't make a mess.<br/>3. Don't turn on that machine</p>\n<p>I'm sure you can follow all 3 of those, right?</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the University of South Wales, in association with Tiny Rebel Games. BA Computer Games Design and BA Game Art students were given the\u00a0module brief... \"When is a Card Game NOT a Card Game?\". Teams were asked\u00a0to make an 8 to 10 minute experience.</p>\n<p>This module has been recognised for it's excellence with a Grads in Games 2022 Award for Collaborative Initiative.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nDevelopment Team\r\n<p><strong>Game Design:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Luke Maloney\u00a0- Team\u00a0Leader / VR Developer<br/>Jan Palka - Lead Designer / Blueprint Designer / Sound Designer<br/>Emmy Hughes\u00a0- Level and Narrative Designer<br/>Corbin Gilbert - Blueprint Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Game Art:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>Samuel J Riley\u00a0- Art Lead / 3D\u00a0Artist<br/>Michael Dorman - Lead Environment Artist<br/>Will Gurd - Concept and 2D Artist<br/>Ariana Dring - 3D and Environment Artist<br/>Wiktoria Duczmal - 3D Artist</p>\n<p>With special thanks to Susan Cummings, Lee Cummings and the team at Tiny Rebel Games.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Find out more about the University of South Wales Games' courses at http://www.southwales.ac.uk/games and http://www.twitter.com/uswgames\u00a0</p>\r\n  created with InstaSlider   \r\n  created with InstaSlider   \r\n  created with InstaSlider", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T10:30:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e02e3a5a4ef1280fd82a5efefae47c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["USW Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
