Throughout the gameplay, players follow the music\u00a0festival preparation workflow and internalise the music festival operation experience. Gameplay\u00a0begins with the preparation stage, where players will make mandatory choices such as artists\u00a0list, stage, promotions, etc. and can choose to prepare some optional contingency plans.</p>\n<p>The Festival stage involves controlling a manager character and moving around the\u00a0environment, tackling various scenarios. Scenarios are timed events based on real-world\u00a0festival case studies. Players will have to make quick decisions to resolve these scenarios that\u00a0will heavily affect the final result and public opinion of this music festival. While making these\u00a0choices, players will learn how to manage audience satisfaction and the budget. These are\u00a0critical elements for a festival\u2019s success; the final result will display these metrics and give\u00a0players a chance to reflect on their choices.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>This project was\u00a0developed by Masters students from the Centre for Digital Media (Vancouyver, BC, Canada), based on an original idea\u00a0from the Embassy of France in Canada.</p>\n<p><strong>Centre for Digital Media Development Team:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Project Manager - Neel Nair</li><li>Programming Lead - Matthew Belford</li><li>Lead Designer - Lan Wang</li><li>UI/2D/Concept Artist- Ada Tam</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1cd/1cdb65784823648e9b16cb809ab94732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["AmbaFranceCanada"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
