I managed to make 3 versions of the game, resulting in a narrative horror.</p>\n<p>Finally, and succumbing to my own shame, I have eliminated most of the narrative leaving it to something tiny that guides us through the 5 games. Upon completion of the \u201ccampaign\u201d, you can customize the games to achieve different challenges.</p>\n<p>I've finish it the last year(2021).</p>\n<p>Made in Unity.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you like it!\u00a0</p>\n<p>More info at https://www.cabranut.com/en/first-steps-english/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T07:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae073cf31e08f4d3ecd19acdf48a9f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Cabranut Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
