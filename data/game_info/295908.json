The game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against friends or family members to see who can get a higher score in one minute.</p>\n<p>The initial concept was making a game based on the framework of Tetris. However, we wanted it to be implemented with the elements of simple math calculations. Calculation symbols such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division were the operators we wanted to put into the game. Our main focus was providing the play aesthetics of challenge and submission, much like Tetris. We wanted the game to be reasonably challenging but not overly complex. We also took inspiration from games like Candy Crush Saga with respect to how we give feedback after a calculation was completed. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adf348cd9f56c26efa2e9bd7f74ed92f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hao Tian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
