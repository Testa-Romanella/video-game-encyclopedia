NailGun Studios wanted to make a comedy-like stealth game that had an ever-changing and dangerous work environment. This vision allowed us to create a game based in an office, but throw unexpected obstacles at the player. The game has 15 levels in total with a lot of collectibles that give a little lore to our small world. This was our first team project for this long so it was a new experience for all of us. We wanted our game to be on a public platform for free so we could look back on it as we pursue our careers, and for you, the player, to enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and we hope you enjoy playing our game as much as we did making it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a61/a61baf5ed23c15540545c1b3537f6f47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NailGun Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NailGun Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
