I tried using Game Maker Studio\u00a0to recreate the first level of the game \"Hocus Pocus\", made by APOGEE for the MS-DOS, to the best of my ability. It's not a \"perfect\" remake though, the enemy spawners might not work <strong>exactly </strong>like the original, as well as some of the collision checks, but I think it's a nice proof of concept.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Controls:</p>\n<p>[ \u2190 / \u2192 ] WALK;<br/>[ CTRL ] JUMP;<br/>[ ALT ] SHOOT;<br/>[ F ] TOGGLE - FULL SCREEN / WINDOWED;<br/>[ F1 ] SHOW GAME INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<p>The game should run very similar to the original, except for the frame rate, which has been improved to 60Hz, providing a smoother experience.</p>\n<p>This is a fan game, and is not to be distributed for any monetary value.
