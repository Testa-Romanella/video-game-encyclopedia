As an employee of the Neural Connection Company, you need to destroy the company's server equipment that stores the artificial intelligence network model to save the AI \u200b\u200bfrom being out of control. At the same time, the reason behind the loss of control of AI was discovered...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is a classic shooting game, but at the same time you can also summon drones and turrets to fight for you. We also advocate this approach, because guns alone cannot stop the AI \u200b\u200barmy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game you can:<br/>\r\n1. Use a variety of firearms to shoot<br/>\r\n2. Use tower defense for defense<br/>\r\n3. Summon drones for coordinated operations<br/>\r\n4. Use an airbrush to paint on the wall<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe main style is similar to a vampire hunter, many monsters charge, and you are responsible for surviving.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no music in this game, because the author can't compose and write lyrics.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T03:10:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb066554c02bf298290e6781616b17a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 258, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Why so serious?"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Why so serious?"], "esrb_rating": null}
