Small game made within a week and a half. Working mechanical demo for a much larger game that may or may not be made, stay tuned.<br/><br/>Music may not loop perfectly and rooms may be invisible for a moment before loading properly. These won't be fixed unless I really, really feel like it, as my priorities are elsewhere.<br/> </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T17:04:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c74f79b4aa8b05955f63577a96a6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheShoeBurglar"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
