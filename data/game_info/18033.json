She is reluctant, as the marriage was arranged and she does not feel it\u2019s the time or the place \u2013 or the man for that matter. She, as a growing number of women of her age, wants to make something more out of herself, and becoming a housewife is not exactly what she had in mind.<br/><br/>Right before the ceremony the groom goes missing. Mary Elisabeth would be fine with this, more than fine, but the thing is, Gilbertworth disappeared in her family\u2019s mansion, and if he\u2019s not found, the blame might fall on her mother, widow Riley.
