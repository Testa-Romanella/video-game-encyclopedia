The locals are afraid and know little, and turn to you with their complaints and fear. However, you know little about it, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are presented with numerous data, articles, letters and opinions each day, and as you are lacking in reliable information, you need to investigate, speak with experts, and make decisions based on what you have collected, or just by listening to your instincts. Your decisions will influence the spread of the disease, the lives of the townsfolk, and, of course, your own position.</p>\n<p><em>Rabid </em>is a point and click adventure game where you need to make decisions that will influence the lives of the anthropomorphic animals living in your town. You can decide which information to rely on, which to investigate further, but the issues you have to face might not be black and white, and sometimes you need to choose priorities or the lesser evil.</p>\n<p>We aimed at a game that is cute and serious at the same time, conveying its message with just the right amount of realism and abstraction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T05:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee5a230fa16ef8f3212ac24a6c3bf3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kuvasz", "Adanedhel", "Nadinu", "gillz", "71nK3R", "Elniss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
