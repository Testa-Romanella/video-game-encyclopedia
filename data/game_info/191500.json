The premise was to make something \"spooky\" within a set time period. Project was made with Unity in about 3 hours while helping other groups. Instructions are outlined on the main screen.</p><p>The goal of the game is to find 5 white lights spread around the map while avoiding a single red light that follows you. The longer the game goes on the faster the red light will move. If it catches you the game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/538ce8e359535d1dba9969288b4e6ff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spidermancy612"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
