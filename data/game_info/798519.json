It was a game I created to challenge myself since I was completely new to the Godot engine and I wanted to see what I could create. This is the result of two months of basically full-time working on the project.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback I would greatly appreciate if you could leave it in the comments. Thank you for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T11:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/094de9bb56e1b0c486b1129035bd5b5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlbertJyllhed"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
