In 48 hours we had to create a game that related to the theme 'Unreliable'.\u00a0 Void (The team name) made a game called 'Journey to Love' where two players have to work together to reach the beach where their lover is. The problem? The car. It is most unreliable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoid boulders and canyon walls. Work together to prevent flat tires.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game can also be seen as a lesbian threesome. Does not contain graphic lesbian trio action. I'm sorry.
