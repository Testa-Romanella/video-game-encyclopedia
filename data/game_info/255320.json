The gameplay is very simple, yet challenging; the player is given four automatic\u00a0sentries that they can place around and have to reload.</p>\r\n Some Notes... \r\n<p> This game is a complete game, however it may still have some bugs (I fixed all the ones I found, but I'm still learning). This is all mostly to experience what it's like to make a game from start to finish, with audio, music, graphics, and everything all the way up to publishing (here (: ). </p>\r\n Thanks To \r\n\r\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li> Unity Technologies for having a free game engine lol </li>\n<li> https://boscaceoil.net/\u00a0for a free music maker</li>\n<li> https://www.bfxr.net/ for a free sound effect maker</li>\n<li> My Canadian friend for his amazing art that I probably butchered</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/670978e8f689e0ec96cdf23a2799eb19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sealeviathan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
