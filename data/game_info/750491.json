You don't need to wait for someone to design a dance or karaoke map for your favorite songs, PerformVR does it for you in a matter of seconds! This isn't your typical dance generation either...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Most VR rhythm games only detect a song's tempo, then match some predefined patterns to it. PerformVR works differently, understanding the context of a song, when measures start, segments &amp; more using university-developed algorithms. PerformVR will use all this information to make a custom dance and set of visuals for 4 different difficulty settings you desire. Easy options are provided in-game to correct dancing mistakes if the analysis is a bit off, which happens infrequently. Read more about it here!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A dancing robotic audience will react to how well you are doing. You will be scored against 100% perfection, so you know how well you are really doing (instead of obscure points) -- don't worry, getting 70% or better is really good and you will be graded from F to AAA+! kurohuku shows how it is done:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv9DXAOGWTo<br/>PerformVR supports karaoke with any song you have &amp; will extract vocal timing and pitches automatically. This works for some songs better than others, and will occasionally pick up notes that are not vocals.<br/><br/>PerformVR can automatically download imagery related to the song you are playing &amp; gather lyrics too. However, this features require some configuration which you can read more about in the community forum.<br/><br/><strong>PerformVR does not provide any music. It will default to looking in your music folder. Analysis can take 15-30 seconds, but only needs to be done once per song</strong>. It is compatible with all popular audio file formats (MP3, OGG, AAC etc.). Trailer music: NEFFEX - Grateful. Uses VAMP Plugins from Queen Mary, University of London (M. Mauch and S. Dixon) &amp; more...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T03:27:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/3840182a12716beddfd0fcf23c083564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phr00t's Software"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phr00t's Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
