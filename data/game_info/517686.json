The object of the game is to fill a 5 by 5 grid with the numbers 1 through 25 in the least amount of time possible. There are only a few rules. The better you do the harder it gets. it has a game show atmosphere, and there are even cheats and easter eggs. Tired of the same old Windows puzzle games? Want something different and unique?
