{"id": 257131, "slug": "midnight-madness", "name": "Midnight Madness", "name_original": "Midnight Madness", "description": "<p>In this game, you are simply trying to dodge cars while supposedly going towards a destination. You use the W and S keys to maneuver side to side while accelerating or decelerating with the A and D keys. The road is automatically generated and the cars are somewhat randomly generated in front of the player.\u00a0This simple game was inspired from all of those nights where I would try to get home before a certain time and I would always feel tempted to speed or to go around cars that I thought were going too slowly. And of course, there have been some close calls in the past, just because of how careless I was in high school when I initially got my driver's license.</p>\n<p>I think the most challenging part of making this game was trying to get everything to feel good. It took so many trials and bug fixes to make sure the game wouldn't do anything funny. I was also much more ambitious than I should have because I ended up doing almost none of the extra stuff that I wanted to do. But at the same time, I am happy with how the game turned out and with how nicely polished it was at the end. I do regret playing around with the shaders too much because that ended up spending a lot of the time where I could've worked on the game instead however, it ended up adding a sort of flair to my game that I never thought was possible anytime soon.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77fce4890fb2ca288829b56ef8327de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["samyoed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
