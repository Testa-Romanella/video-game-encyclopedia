In one of these fists is your heart in a jar. Or is it someone else's?\u00a0In either case you can't live very long without it, so either kill or be killed, and don't let them break your heart.\u00a0Good luck.<br/><br/>Left click fires right hand - Fast, reliable. Non lethal if connection is lost. Right click fires left hand - A deadly explosion. Must retrieve within 7 seconds if severed. Walking directly over a severed limb picks it up.</p>\n<p>We didn't quite have time to fix the absolute mountain of bugs and design issues that cropped up along the way -- sorry about that. For most of us this was our very first jam. We're still happy with most of the visuals and the music and the sound effects, and it's technically mostly playable -- so give it a try if you like this genre!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art: Kanuki (https://itch.io/profile/kanuki00)</p>\n<p>Design/Leading: Mark Davison (https://itch.io/profile/markda)</p>\n<p>SFX:\u00a0BravoDS (https://itch.io/profile/bravods)<br/></p>\n<p>Music: Lucy Phillips (https://itch.io/profile/lucydoesmusic)<br/></p>\n<p>Programming/IT stuff:\u00a0LurkNautili (https://lurknautili.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Everyone had some input in game design in the brainstorming phase and all throughout the process. On top of models and animation kanuki also did the bulk of the level design in this final prototype. Alongside managing the project schedule and tasks, Mark did the UI stuff and a various things on the blueprint side (e.g. the enemy AI). The banger of a soundtrack is by Lucy who, due to popular request, is considering making extended tracks and distributing them on Spotify -- we did a different game during a 24h test jam the previous weekend and it also had a pretty nice track. Bravo's SFX\u00a0really help bring the characters alive, he's the only one with previous jam experience. My role was mostly on the C++ side of Unreal (partly in BP), trying to design a reasonable software architecture and providing IT solutions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:52:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d217a80505d19ef9176e6c491e6ebe9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BravoDS", "LurkNautili", "Mark.Da", "kanuki00"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
