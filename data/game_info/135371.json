{"id": 135371, "slug": "snaek", "name": "Snaek", "name_original": "Snaek", "description": "<p>This is a very early prototype for a stealth game with mechanics from the game Snake. Your length is your health, but being longer means you can be spotted easier, and be hit easier as well. However, due to time constraints, the majority of mechanics were not implemented during the jam period. The jam version is playable now, while work continues to be done to implement basic stealth gameplay in later versions, which will not be uploaded until after the judging period, to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p>\u2014<br/><br/>Keyboard Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Directions \u2014 move</p>\n<p>A, S \u2014 cycle through items</p>\n<p>X \u2014 use item</p>\n\n<p>Console Controls:</p>\n<p>Directions \u2014 move</p>\n<p>X, Y \u2014 cycle through items</p>\n<p>B \u2014 use item</p>\n\n<p>Items:<br/></p>\n<p>Ration: use while moving to grow your snake</p>\n<p>Cigarettes: continuously hurts you while equipped.
