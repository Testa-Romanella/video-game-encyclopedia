While it remains largely unfinished, I promised myself I would post it on time and I am still quite happy with the results. Whether I will continue the game and expand its levels, I am unsure of for now. Please download or play the game on browser and have a good time!</p><p><strong>Here a small tutorial since I didn't have time to include it into the game</strong><br/></p><p>Place down towers with left click onto the map. You can read the description of items in the shop. Press 'Start Wave' when you are ready. If enough enemies get through your HP will deplete until zero, at which point you lose. There are 10 waves in total.</p>\n<p>~Pyrohazard</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T03:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a50/a507334b346e2f1381bc7f3c05dca806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PyroHazard"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
