The purpose of this project was to have a \"real world\" opportunity to learn the basics of the Godot engine / tool set, and to learn enough about pixel art &amp; animation to make graphics I can be proud of. I think I accomplished those goals pretty well, even if the gameplay is still very basic.</p>\n<p>Try to get a high score!
