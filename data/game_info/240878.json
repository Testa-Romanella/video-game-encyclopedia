I had planned to have the scene be animated and dynamic so she would interact with her mp3 player when the song changed, but since I only had about a day to work on it, I just didn't have the time unfortunately.\u00a0 Currently you can listen to 12 tracks from a few different artists and press Space or Right Shift to skip to the next song.\u00a0I might add a few things to it later down the line, but mostly this was just for some practice and to get the creative juices flowing.</p>\n<p><strong>//Controls///////////////////</strong></p>\n<p>Space or Right Shift: Next song</p>\n<p><strong>//Credits///////////////</strong></p>\n<p>Art, code, design: CountMoxi</p>\n<p>Original Famicom idea and case:\u00a0Devine Lu Linvega</p>\n<p>Music: Youtube:\u00a0No Copyright Music - Free Audio Library</p>\n<p>-Music Artists: Artiicial Music, DJQuads, Lakey Inspired, OurMusicBox (Jay Man), Michael Hildreth</p><p>font:\u00a0Pixeled by OmegaPC777</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fc/9fc879c6fa11f852da93a9348cc850e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CountMoxi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
