One player controls the left paddle, while the second player controls the right paddle. Both players try to work together to earn the highest score possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>VS:\u00a02 Players\u00a0 compete in getting the highest score. Players can slap packages back to try to throw the other player off. First person to miss three packages loses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>VS. AI:\u00a0Same rules as VS mode, except with an AI opponent. The AI has have 5 difficulty settings, affecting their ability\u00a0to catch and slap packages, ranging from Very Easy to Very Hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>W - Move left paddle up</p>\n<p>S - Move left paddle down</p>\n<p>D -\u00a0Slap left paddle</p>\n<p>Up Arrow - Move right paddle up (Single Player, VS, and CO-OP only)<br/></p>\n<p>Down Arrow - Move right paddle down.</p>\n<p>Left Arrow - Slap right paddle</p>\n\n<p>Escape: Pause Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:16:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ad2757ab5a96e24297bda9171d2dfef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blast Studio Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
