Why did you make THIS game?\u00a0<br/></strong>At the conclusion of my\u00a0second mission, I decided to work on the project that has always been lurking in my mind. With two cleared missions under my belt, it is time...</p>\n<p><strong>2. Is this a remake?\u00a0<br/></strong>A remake of what?\u00a0 Oh, that? Of course not.\u00a0First of all, the title is different!\u00a0 Secondly, the villain in the image is looking longingly at his favorite meme, probably.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>3. Anything different?\u00a0<br/></strong>From what? Oh, that? Yeah. A lot.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this a remaster?\u00a0<br/></strong>What a silly idea: remakes that use RTP graphics. Anything I make can\u00a0<strong><em>only\u00a0</em></strong>ever be seriously considered\u00a0an \"unmaster\" or a \"demaster.\" But, there may be ideas that could be considered retoolings.</p>\n<p><strong>5. When will it be finished?\u00a0<br/></strong>Don't hold your breath. The trailer says Summer 2022 - likely, it will be before that. But, you can view the demo for now.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Is there a better Q&amp;A I\u00a0can consult?\u00a0<br/></strong>For what?</p>\n<p><strong>7. Is this for sale?\u00a0<br/></strong>Nah, you can have it for free.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>8. Why'd you pick that color for the sidebars?</strong>\u00a0<br/>Bad reasons.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>9. What sidebars are you talking about?\u00a0<br/></strong>Turn your phone to landscape mode.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>10. Will you update the game?</strong>\u00a0<br/>Yes. Well, not the demo.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Does this game have anything to do with your\u00a0</strong>other\u00a0games<strong>?\u00a0<br/></strong>Yes. But if you didn't know about the other projects, you would never know. It qualifies both as standalone and sequel, simultaneously.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T08:14:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4843ee67225bbab33f6fecf55370ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterprmiller"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
