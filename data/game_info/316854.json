They aim to build an artistic tribute to Halo that recreates the multiplayer experience of the Bungie-era games. The game will be free to play on all PC platforms, including: Windows, macOS, and Linux. The game is a combination of what they believe to be the best parts of the classic Bungie-era Halo games. While they mostly focus on recreating the Halo 2 and Halo 3 experience, there are also elements of Combat Evolved and Reach sprinkled in. Features from later 343 Industries Halo games can be enabled in Custom Games, but will not be a part of Matchmaking or official playlists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2019-05-09T05:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54ae0b0f1b548bc5918a007334795770.jpg", "website": "https://installation01.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
