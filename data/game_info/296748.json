It has three endings and a lil secret, owo.</p>\n<p>It's my first game ever XD! I'm excited to share this in public but also nervous, obviously. This game is extremely rushed because I plan to make a new project. The quality isn't also the best, but it was a good first try imo. Criticism will be appreciated!!</p>\n<p>Music credit in the note 'music', thank you so much for all the non-copyrighted music creators I used.
