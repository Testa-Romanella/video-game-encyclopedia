I created it in a total of about 5 hours across 6 days. Wanted to have more time but ran into a big project for work. First time writing with C and first time making something for the gameboy. I think it went well but had to greatly reduce the game of it to finish in time.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p> In the top left is the amount of souls you have. If you run out you lose, if you have 100 you win. I wanted to start with 0 but didn't have time to add the logic to not instantly lose.</p>\n<p>ln the top right is an indicator of\u00a0whether your card needs to be higher or lower than the devils. H means you need a higher card, L means you need a lower card.</p>\n<p>In the center you have your hand. These three cards are what you can choose from to bet against the devil. You select them with the D-Pad. Left - Left Card, Up - Middle Card, Right - Right Card.</p>\n\n<p>There are 11 cards in the game with this order: A &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9 &lt; Jack &lt; King.</p>\n\n<p>There isn't much of a game but it was a good experience learning about memory management and reusing of sprites. This game is unlike anything I have ever programmed before.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Nick for the Art. If only I had time for sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f69/f6940ec521c154ddd7604d5ecfe232a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tgb20"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
