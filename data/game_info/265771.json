This has no real consequences for gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>It may be possible to break game flow by hurling a Keyball or Connectcube out of the playable space, though I've done my best to ensure they'll be respawned by the Droppers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c426345c1f20371dede953ee82e10647.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnAnonymousMoose"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
