Therefore, jumping and shooting will shoot a different projectile than standing still or walking. The grounded projectile deals more damage, whereas the air projectiles are faster and undeterred by gravity. If you defeat the sword boss (from the banner above), you will be rewarded a laser weapon. You can use it when you are standing still, when it starts firing, you can begin to walk or jump with it. However, to initialize it, you must stand still and hold the shoot button.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are two bosses in the game, for now.\r\n</p>\n<p>I have blocked off the paths that lead no where because those parts are under development.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you happen to give the game a try, I would love feedback! Soft or harsh! Thank you!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:52:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f465aa7e4dffda58b9009f220d4ae4f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ripper53"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
