{"id": 682405, "slug": "constructed-to", "name": "constructed to", "name_original": "constructed to", "description": "<p>This is 'constructed to', a new video game from Outhouse Media. It makes no sense any more.<br/>\nThe retro format of video games is very much made for the 'second screen'. They simulate the events of real life, where there is no real action or interaction. You cannot move around, so if you die, you die in a truly bizarre manner. This makes for chaos, because there is no way to tackle everything that is happening without losing your footstep. Video games owe their existence to this, because they are very much an attempt to simulate reality, and our own lives, for as long as possible.\n\nYou have your arm around a vanishing guy, and he has his left arm around your shoulder. So you have performed some strangest scene: he runs away from you, but you have your arm around him, and he is still running away. You have your leg between his and the ground, and you are just trying to keep him quiet, and it's going to happen. You can kill the guy in one hit, but once you've done it, he might not have a choice but to turn around and run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point of all this is to make a game that feels like it is real. It feels like you are actually in the game, with the things that are happening. If you're playing a video game, that's called realism: the setting, the characters, the environment, the world we've created. Games that pretend it's not is called faux realism.\n\nO</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/9759646a29c9c8cbe403729f038e9b79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
