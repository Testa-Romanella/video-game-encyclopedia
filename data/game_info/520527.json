We made\u00a0a musical experience requiring the players to sing different parts of a song. The idea is that when you start with the first player, its quite a simple tune but once everyone has started singing the most beautiful song is made. Things are always better when we work together, especially when we use our differences for good. Vivere in concordia (live in harmony).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77acbbb415c6af694275845262dadaa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Jamalambs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
