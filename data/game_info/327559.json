You're the last person left alive. OR ARE YOU?</p>\n<p>Trace a mysterious cry for help back to its source through ten sectors of irradiated underground ruins - but be careful! Take no more than 20 steps in each sector or you'll have to restart. Otherwise, take too long and you'll die of radiation poisoning. Yikes!</p>\n<p>There's no combat and the only environmental hazard are anomalies - they won't kill you if you touch one but they'll definitely do SOMETHING. Also, the game has TWO ENDINGS! And a SECRET BIRTHDAY CAKE!<br/></p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/puzzlejam\u00a0- the theme was 'Black and White' so I was totally original and made something in black and white. But also green and purple.\u00a0<br/></p><p>----------</p><p>The only thing I forgot to add to the credits in-game is that the background art and 'rubble' were all made from 'Monochrome Caves', a free asset from Adam Saltsman [https://adamatomic.itch.io/].
