Here's your chance! <br/>\t\t\t\t\t\tMUD TV is your ticket to the weird wild world of television. Once you take control of your own station it's up to you to determine the line-up, hire actors and directors, produce your own shows, series and movies and to grab those lucrative advertising deals from right under your competitors' noses. Oh, and about the competition: you can either play MUD TV alone, with your friends over a network or via Internet! Go head-to-head with your opponents as you fight for market share amongst the retired and housewives, headhunt their best employees and, if that doesn't do the trick, a little sabotage should keep your enemies from getting too bored! Or, as an alternative, you can assume control of a station together with a friend and run it cooperatively.<br/> <ul><li>Create your own crazy station and take it to the top of the ratings<br/> </li><li>Create your own television empire and build offices, studios, newsrooms and many other important facilities to help secure your success<br/> </li><li>Create your own character and guide them through your own hard-earned television empire<br/> </li><li>Produce your own movies or secure the rights to the best of what the free market has to offer before the competition does<br/> </li></ul>", "metacritic": 53, "released": "2010-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-01T14:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a96cc9a1520da889ac36c98c1f189ec.jpg", "website": "http://www.mud-tv.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 157, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 449, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Realmforge Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
