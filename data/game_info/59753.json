Fight through waves of enemies as you tear off their limbs and use them as weapons, all while exploring congested and hostile landscapes that will test your mettle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong>:<br/><ul><li>Hostile environments - In the middle of a dying volcano, the swamp house of a crazed shaman, the sacrificial grounds of the First Tribe, and more. Fight in handcrafted arena-like environments, each with its own dangers to take heed of while combating an onslaught of enemies. <br/></li><li>Dismemberment arsenal - tear off a limb, use it as a weapon. Each enemy type has a limb with unique properties for combat, while fast-degrading durability keeps you on the move for the next weapon, and the next kill.<br/></li><li>Agile combat - Circle-dash around enemies to get behind them, wall-run to cover distance, wall-jump to prep a smash attack.

Use every tool you have to survive these extended combat sequences.</li></ul><ul><li>Leaderboards - compete against friends or global players as you perfect your score for each arena.<br/></li><li>Stylized Look - a mid-poly, gritty, painterly aesthetic presents a fractured old world through environmental storytelling, brought to life in Unreal Engine 4.<br/><br/>Add <strong>Torn Asunder</strong> to your wishlist to be notified when it launches!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/850397f04e398d7c320cf421fc1aed3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Farhan Qureshi"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Farhan Qureshi"], "esrb_rating": null}
