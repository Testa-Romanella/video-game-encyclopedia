This is my first time making a card game, but\u00a0I really enjoyed the process. I already went over the allotted three hours, but I wish I had even more time to add sound effects and a bit more responsiveness. I'm pretty happy with what I made in the time, but drawing so many cards (even if they are simple) was way more time consuming than I anticipated.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by SET, a card game I love but am also incredibly bad at. That's why I included two game modes with different difficulty settings. <br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Easy</strong>: All cards are of      the same color. If you are colorblind, I also      recommend this mode.</li><li><strong>Hard</strong>: Includes all three colors.</li></ul>\n<p>Please tell me how many packages you managed to send off! :)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The stamps have three features: Color, symbol and number of symbols. For each feature, the three cards have to either be all the same or all different. This means a valid set of cards could e.g.\u00a0 all be the same color, have different symbols and a different number of symbols.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Click on the card you want      to select\r\n</li><li>Click on it again to unselect a card</li><li>Click on the Shuffle Button      to re-shuffle the cards.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Color Palette: Lost Century by CopheeMoth<br/></li><li>Font: Pixel Small by Lana Ro</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:40:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c3173e04e486dac2ab372e93feabbfae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sorbit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
