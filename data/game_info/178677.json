I'm really grateful for this opportunity and for the support I've received during development. NOTE: YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO MAKE USE OF THE \"R\" (restart level) and \"N\" (next level) buttons. This game isn't hard, but its probably more than a little broken. At the very least you'll need to do some creative jumping at parts... Check out my devlog here  and tumblr here for concept art and junk.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9f8b6b5bc0f9f804fded6cebafbbba9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["idley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
