To win the game, you must collect every card in every level; and before every card is another challenge to complete.<br/></p>\n<p>The original <em>Hijinx </em>won first place at the third Godot Wild Jam. The enhanced edition brings with it a <strong>complete graphical overhaul</strong>, and adds new levels and gameplay mechanics to make a total of <strong>thirty cards to collect over ten unique levels</strong>, besides numerous other changes.</p>\n<p>You can view the source code here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2efeec79b6bba3c436abb62786bf46b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JohnGabrielUK"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
