He asks us to reflect on his adventure. What's the reason behind the creation of his operating system? What does he seek from us? Can you solve this mystery?<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>The game is a modernized version of the Alternate Reality Game (ARG) genre. Each problem is presented as an enticing blend of text, graphics, or video. The puzzles guide you through the plot, combining and expanding on the secrets you've already discovered, and uncovering deeper and more intricate riddles that will astonish, thrill, and even scare you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Beware: the solutions to the puzzles may be encrypted in codes, hidden within riddles, shrouded in history, coordinated in the real-life world, or guarded by the numerical of other dark concealments.<br/>John Doe wants you to experience the reality where you can go to any lengths possible to unbox the mystery. Be your guide and utilize whatever that can prove handy: Internet, books, library, encyclopedias, your real-life experiences, anything.
