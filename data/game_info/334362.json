She discovers a mysterious sword, which transports her to a different world where she meets the Greek god Zeus. He invites her to attend a school in a separate world that he created. Zeus intends to teach the meaning of love to the various young divine beings who also attend the school, in an attempt to reverse the weakening bond between humans and the gods. </p>\n<p>There, Kusanagi stumbles across several fabled legends uttered in her hometown; some of these aliases being Hades, Loki, Anubis, Helios, Baldr, Dionysus, Amaterasu, Thor, and even some others that the heroine has not yet heard of. As Kusanaga deepens her links with the gods, what will become of her spirit? Will it become tainted with unfathomable knowledge? Or will she persevere through this unexplored realm, balancing out the body and mind to someday return home? Be the guide of Kusanaga, and lead the way to sway what the fates intend!</p>\n<p>(*Souce of Description - Kamigami no Asobi Wiki; &#39;Kamigami no Asobi InFinite&#39;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T02:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bc/9bcdcc7a424d7c99cbb0d6052babd29d.jpg", "website": "http://www.kamiaso.com/game/infinite/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PSP", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Nippon Ichi Software", "LANTERN ROOMS"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Broccoli"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
