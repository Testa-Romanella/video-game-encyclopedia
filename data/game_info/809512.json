So I stopped working on it for another game but I felt weird just leaving it in the folder and collecting dust, so I thought I would upload it. Keep in mind it is unfinished and very buggy. So I hope you enjoy this very rough roguelike game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T09:15:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f8b255989f98f2d63bd8da4208e0826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ink Goomba"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
