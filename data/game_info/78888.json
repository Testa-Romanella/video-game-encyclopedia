There are three fun versions:<br/><br/>In Classic mode, match three or more shapes to remove them from the board. Longer paths get your more points, and if you clear the board you will double your points!<br/><br/>In Multi mode, you can match by color OR by shape. Looking for two different types of matches is a great workout for your brain, and trying to find the longest path can be a real challenge!<br/><br/>In Maze mode, there is a single chain that uses all the shapes. Find it to win!<br/><br/>Each mode comes in two levels. The first level is free, and a harder paid level is available to give advanced players an extra challenge. Game Center leaderboards let you compete against your friends or the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T00:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa993bea14211fd905fbf2f8157c8358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Sarah Pierce"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Sarah Pierce"], "esrb_rating": null}
