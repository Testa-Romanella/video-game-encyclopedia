The gameplay revolves around battling hordes of enemies paying particular attention to movement and positioning, almost dancing around the various fight challenges placed in the levels. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The most prominent feature of the game is the classic take on the FPS aspects, but with some \"modern\" touches.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Power ups are acquirable by exploring different path or paying attention to the surroundings, graphical clues will give away the presence of a secret in the area and most of the time the player must solve a light platforming section, a quick switch-hunt or a short maze to reach the power up. Such power ups are used to modify the behavior of the  weapons and enhance the player movement capabilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The player is free to move back and forth between levels and areas as s/he will often find a closed path that require a key, a tool or a powerup in order to be unlocked. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The action takes place in a dystopian world inspired by 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 and the narrative of the levels is expanded by tomes of lore scattered through the levels.<br/>The whole experience is framed by a magnificent soundtrack composed specifically for each level, that dynamically changes in the most tense situations. The soundtrack was composed by Giordano Aisa, who joined the development of Palladium with his music and his passion for boomer shooters.<br/>Last but not least, if anyone did not noticed from the screenshots, the whole point of the game is to simply paint the level red.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T03:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6dc/6dcce37b34c4250f544a07488bf228dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Must.iolo"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Must.iolo"], "esrb_rating": null}
