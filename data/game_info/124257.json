{"id": 124257, "slug": "block-blocks", "name": "Block Blocks", "name_original": "Block Blocks", "description": "<p>Block Blocks is a puzzle game like no other. As blocks cross your screen, you must draw lines to stop them. It's not that simple though. As blocks chip away at your defenses, each one reacts differently by turning direction, bouncing off, or even exploding. Long lines cover more area but are much weaker than short ones, so crafting the best defense is a matter of the situation. You'll be blocking blocks for hours with a hundred challenges and five unique endless modes. So remember, clear your screen often, watch the edges, and block blocks.</p><p>\"...utterly compelling and elegantly designed puzzle game.\" - Paul Hack (IndieGames.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fe/9fed6371da3e02596d9b5c69576f5206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["scottwashi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
