All creatures lived in great prosperity, and all were considered equals. All had equal say and equal rights. All was well.<br/><br/>One day, however, the oil they used to create energy for their city ran dry. The water, after dumping all of their trash into it, became too polluted to drink. The soil became dry and barren from overuse, and stopped bearing fruit and vegetables to eat.<br/><br/>Their way of life, abruptly came to a halt.<br/><br/>Soon after, the different species turned against one another, blaming each other for the situation. The Giants massive bodies required more food, so they were blamed with the food shortage. The Sagaraths and their constant need for Air Conditioning, were blamed with using too much electricity, and thus were responsible for the oil shortage. And the Cruplings, with their obsession with long hot showers, were blamed with running out of clean water.<br/><br/>They began to fight amongst one another, and a great war broke out between the tribes.<br/><br/>After years of fighting, the disparate tribes became too weak from lack of nourishment, that they all surrendered at the same time. The creatures went their separate ways and scattered across the world, no longer united with each other or even amongst their own tribes.<br/><br/>The few creatures that survived lived on scraps, and wandered the wasteland of their world. Over time, many forgot about their once great utopia, though the ruins of its many shops, houses, and infrastructure still remain.<br/><br/>You are an Architect, a genetically engineered humanoid with the sole purpose of cleaning up polluted and destroyed cities. You will be sent to this wasteland and there, you will journey across this ancient world, rid its waters of pollution, break down its decrepit structures of old, and recycle and reuse its materials.<br/><br/>Find the lost creatures, and use their help to traverse the world using their unique abilities. and in return, you will feed them, house them, and give them jobs and a sense of purpose. <br/><br/>You will make their lives better with new facilities, beautiful architecture, and renew their perspectives with artistic decoration, interior and exterior, re-purposing ancient artifacts and monuments that you find from the old world, using your own unique creative eye to turn the urban wasteland into a beautiful and live-able utopia, greater than the planet has ever seen.\"<br/><br/>But be careful, Architect. Although you are adept at making friends, there are many who will resist you.<br/><br/>And at night... The green stuff comes.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e9e051d6d803113d82a2d2695461fc.jpg", "website": "http://thearchitect.spookystar.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 59}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Jasonario", "Spooky Star"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jasonario", "Spooky Star"], "esrb_rating": null}
