But, even such menial tasks can hold may dangers of a big city for one not used to its streets. Scammers, beggars and delinquents lurk around every corner waiting for unsuspecting targets. <br/>Make friends and enemies in this twisted modern day RPG where every day activities seem like a grueling tasks for the player to deal with.
