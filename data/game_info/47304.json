Keep within spitting distance of the wall to receive a short, colourful Second Wind speed boost and gain the opportunity to be one eighth euphoric.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot enough for you? Don your favourite fedora, go for eight pieces, and enter the multicoloured rainbow world of Euphoria where time goes even faster, spikes disappear and time speeds up dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, choose from 36 game themes (or throw it on Shuffle), each containing seven poems ranging from surprisingly clever to embarrassingly hideous. If you're English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, German, Spanish, Japanese, American or from Bristol or Norwich, I apologise profusely. Have the game mock your failures in one of 51 ways of varying levels of Britishness. And work your way through over 100 challenges that pit your wits against all of the arcade game modes and everything you can do within them. All while other people's highscores eclipse and shame you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is the flashiest, fleshiest Maddening to date. It even has some diamondy bits.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nJust don't buy it if you suffer from epilepsy.
