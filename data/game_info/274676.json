But  beware, for not all manipulations come without a cost. <br/></p>\n<p>Indeed, if you want to master the elements, <strong>sacrifices\u00a0must be\u00a0made</strong>.</p>\n\r\nRules\r\n<p>Everytime you press a direction, the elements will try to move into that direction, unless it has reached the edge or is blocked by another element.</p>\n<p>Whenever an element is blocked by another, the elements will try to interact with each other; such interaction can happen in 2 ways:</p>\n<p>1 - You will merge 2 elements if they have the same type (color) and level (number).</p>\n<p>2 - You will destroy an element if the incoming one has elemental strength (as shown on right panel) against the destination element, as long as the incoming one has a higher level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6745779220b5c2e46e2e8de99555009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RMiranda"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
