I've been having many bizarre game ideas over the years as i slowly learned game development, and here i decided to combine them all in the context of one big abstract platformer, starring a sentient proton shaped like a cat's head who lives in a corrupted simulation.<br/><br/>For now the game is very rough - there's only one gigantic level with a few locations from the abovementioned games embedded into it, as well as some original content. Let me know what you think, and stay tuned for more if you like it!<br/><br/>The soundtrack is by Fever, a great friend of mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T10:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a718501a4dedb4d04351da97b9badff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oberorka"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
