The camera follows a 'hero' particle, and the different kinds of particles have special properties. There's a variety of charges and masses, and some are unstable and explode on collision. This is an exploratory / ambient game with no set goals.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nFollowing the TrainJam 2015 theme \r\n\t<em>On Track</em>, this was inspired by the cloud tracks left by charged particles in cloud chambers and the fields used in particle detectors to determine mass/charge ratios.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe physics isn't much like our universe, however.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SPACE</strong>: Start, Reset</li>\n<li><strong>UP</strong>: Increase field</li>\n<li><strong>DOWN</strong>: Decrease field</li>\n<li><strong>ESCAPE</strong>: Exit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\tThe indicator at the bottom left of the screen shows the current field strength.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\n<strong>Design, Programming and Art</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMikayla 'mhutch' Hutchinson (@mjhutchinson)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Music and Sound</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNick Weihs (@nickweihs)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Special Thanks</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAdriel Wallick (@msminotaur)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tEir\u00edkr \u00c5sheim (@d6)\r\n</p>\r\nSource\r\n<p>\r\n\tFull source code is available \r\n\ton GitHub.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/376/376ce246e1e0f92d9d1c7d1d61b483ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mikayla Hutchinson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
