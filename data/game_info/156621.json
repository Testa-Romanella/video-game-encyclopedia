You are now standing in line for a job interview to be a construction worker. Whilst walking to the manager, a table from the story above you accidentally slides out through a big open hole in the (still under construction) wall, and falls right on your head. You fall, fall, fall, into a hole and deep underground. A few hours later you wake up, in a different place as before.
