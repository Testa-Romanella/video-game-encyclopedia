This experimental game has some crazy stuff going on, and I don't want to spoil it, but the general crazy idea is that every player's playthrough affects another. I came up with the idea of Taxi because I thought about players telling each other stories through a sort of middleman (this game), and in this way I wanted to explore the idea of each player's playthrough affecting another myself. </p>\n<p>Huge thanks to the developers of Moirai for making something so experimental and interesting, and for the inspiration for this game's concept.</p>\n<p>Notes:<br/></p>\n<p>-Input is a little finnicky so be careful not to hit enter until you have finished typing whatever is asked of you.</p>\n<p>-Output is also finnicky, and formatting can be strange. Didn't have time to really polish either input or output.</p>\n<p>*** YOU NEED INTERNET TO PLAY THIS GAME ***</p>\n<p>--How to Play--</p>\n<p>1.
