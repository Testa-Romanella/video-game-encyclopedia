That, to me, is amazing.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry to say that this game isn't anything spectacular. It's a pretty generic endless runner with janky one-bit pixel art and a hypnotic drum beat.<br/></p>\n<p>Hopefully, you'll pay my page a visit again in a couple of years. If you do, maybe I'll have made a game worthy of the significance and cosmic odds of your presence. Until then, I hope you enjoy my tiny little game :)</p>\n\n<p>Oh btw, press UP to jump, and DOWN to slide.
