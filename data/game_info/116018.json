Practice spatial reasoning and patience, as you manoeuvre your Circle shift using only the three points that define it.There is no game like Circle shift so if you're up for a challenge and want to try something new - this just might be the game for you.</p>\n<p>I first though of the game when I was reading over a maths textbook and set myself the goal to publish it within the month.</p><p>Your objective is to move the circle over a goal by moving one of three points, while keeping it on the island.</p><p>You may only move one point at a time, and you have to keep all three, plus your circle, on the safe island area.</p><p>Each time you move a point counts as a move (although once moved a point can be moved until another is picked up). Try to solve each level with the lowest moves possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5a0b9382e986f163261af6e1d3f828.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StupidLittleGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
