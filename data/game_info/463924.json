Your mission is to restore gravity collecting every moon shard in the different biomes shown in the map below! you will be equipped with an all-terrain suit that allows you to double jump! but you must be careful, the closer you get to your goal, the more unpredictable gravity becomes, which results in a change of position with\u00a0 each gravity change!</p>\n\n<p>The only reason its not in WebGL format is because it wont work with the pipeline we were working with</p>\n\n<p>We hope you enjoy this game.
