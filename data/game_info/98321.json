You must battle every other figurine that is in your way. But remember you are only on a coffee table.</p>\n<p>Controls: It is \"WASD\" to move, \"Left Click\" for your stab attack and \"Shift\" to dash.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Ludum Dare 38 Challenge. It was a tough three days but it was a good three days spent, making a game. Overall, we all had a great experience and had a fun time.</p>\n<p>Tools Used:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Unity 5.6 (C#)</li><li>Piskel</li><li>Fl Studios</li><li>BFXR</li></ul>\n<p>People Involved:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Tyranosaw (https://twitter.com/Tyranosaw)</li><li>Zuezazon (https://twitter.com/Zuezazon)</li><li>Fynzyme (https://soundcloud.com/fynzyme).</li></ul>\n<p>Ludum Dare Website: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/tabletop-ar...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8efe01068d70f75541e7e664a0e80e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tyranosaw"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
