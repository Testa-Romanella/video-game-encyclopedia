If you don't, well discover what happens. All assets were created by us with tweaks to pre-existing ones.</p>\n<p>Spend one minute defending each body part or try to discover new combinations. Play the game however you want whether it's trying to keep the human completely human or messing with different body parts and trying to figure out how to change your character into the type of character you want.</p>\n<p>Have fun and thank you for checking out this fun project we all enjoyed being apart of.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T05:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9e40ac04210e7450f199715c5ba378.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanteDercksen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
