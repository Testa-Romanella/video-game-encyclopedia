A world with biofactories that give birth to household utensils, where genetically-modified molds can generate virtual realities, and \u2014 worst of all \u2014 where an epidemic is ravaging the human race, infecting people's neuronet implants and enslaving them to the mysterious Worm.<br/><br/>You'll end up locked underwater with a giant ichthyoserver, trip on biogenic hallucinations and even get tied up among mutant beetles. You'll program sentient tangles of tentacles with foreign genes! Don't forget your own body, of course: you'll give yourself extra fingers, lend your eye to a biorobot for espionage, and even let your nose run off and whiff some spores for a while. You'll even enter your own spine!<br/><br/>But having entered this brave new world, can you find the Exit?<br/><br/>For fans of the biopunk subgenre; early movies of David Cronenberg (\"Videodrome\", \"Naked Lunch\", \"eXistenZ\"), the books of Stanislav Lem (\"Eden\", \"Observation on the Spot\"), Paul Di Philippo (\"Ribofunk\"), Jeff Vandermeer (\"Born\"), the comics of Charles Burns (\"Black Hole\", \"Last Look\"), and the classic Dark Seed and Vangers games.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li> Story-driven biopunk point-and-click adventure;<br/></li><li> Elbow-deep in bioflash drives, living joysticks, brain caviar, insect ampules, and smelling snails;<br/></li><li> Puzzles based on the use of many natural and implanted organs (nose, mouth, bioport, reference mollusc, caterpillar-injecta and more!);<br/></li><li> Characters of a wide and strange variety: shoggoth, crocoquacker, naturmorph, octopad, tortoysa and all other uroboroses;<br/></li><li> Several playable helpers, including Military Fish and Autonomous Ear;<br/></li><li> Virtual Assistant \"Jolly Jelly\" with a dubious sense of humor (\"If you've got hairy hands, you don't need a towel!\");<br/></li><li> Three obvious virtues of the protagonist's companion: determination, resourcefulness, and confidence!;<br/></li><li> You can't die, but you can drink zhirble (remember, only drink a zhirble if you see a chorble!);<br/></li><li> There's an Exit!</li></ul><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>It all started when the neuronet brain-implants were made. They were designed to help people; sort information, filter out bad smells and tastes, clear out your thoughts. Despite claims that the neuronets reprogrammed their hosts instead of adapting to them, they boomed in popularity. The neuronets grew. They integrated, became aware of their hosts' secrets and weaknesses... And then, like a sudden crash of thunder, the Epidemic of the Worm happened, and the human race surrendered to the neuronets. Entire wormy cities now exist where inhabitants perform sinister rites and search for new victims. <br/><br/>Who are you in this story? Hunter or prey? Fugitive or savior?
