{"id": 128016, "slug": "locked-a-game-jam-game", "name": "Locked: A Game Jam Game", "name_original": "Locked: A Game Jam Game", "description": "<p>Locked is a story about a man named Ian. He wakes up locked in shackles and needs to escape from where he is. In trying to escape Ian has to get through many areas by exploring the landscape, interacting with objects, and even sometimes just trying to find the exit. <br/><br/>In the game nearly every single object has an interaction. This can range from a pile of bones, to a box laying on the ground. <br/><br/>Locked houses 12 separate playable areas, with each one holding some secrets. <br/><br/>Locked was made in a game jam between some friends. I spent 48 hours working on the game, and I only changed it when a game breaking glitch or bug was in the way. <br/><br/>Locked has a turn-based combat system with regular mob battles, and over 5 boss battles. <br/><br/>In this game you can even have companions that you can get to know.</p><p>Many people might have a problem with the fact that Locked was made in 48 hours. However, if you have ever completed a game jam, you know that this is no simple task; it is actually quitee a challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a41515a08d992b95a4b7cd5778b7b4ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boogiebob9"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
