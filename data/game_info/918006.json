Collect points by being annoying and floating over the pupil, but be prepared to be flicked around. Leaving the eye before the timer ends means Game Over! Gather up to three of your friends and fight over your territory in local multiplayer. Or play against the AI in a 1v3 battle to the death.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Both mouse and keyboard as well as controllers are supported for input. Join a game by either clicking with the mouse or pressing the Start button. You can wiggle around by alternating between A and D or Left and Right Trigger/Shoulder buttons. You can look around by using the mouse or using either stick on the controller.</p>Credits<ul><li>Made by: redkite</li><li>SFX: freesound.org</li><li>Music:<ul><li>The Visitors</li><li>The Big House</li><li>@ audionautix.com</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T06:55:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c74998285362b748d2de9e0f4d04031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["redkite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
