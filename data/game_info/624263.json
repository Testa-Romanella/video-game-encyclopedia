Featuring the song 'DarkStars' from @daveragenormal (check out his instagram and spotify).\u00a0</p>\n<p>We had a sort of collaborative mash up and this version of the game was used to create the official music video for the single (link coming later).</p>\n\n<p>Control Info.</p>\n<p>You can play with either a controller or a keyboard and mouse. Controls are displayed in game.<br/></p>\n<p>-\"Attack\" will try to home in on nearby enemies. Pressing a direction will try to prioritise enemies in that direction.</p>\n<p>-You have 3 air dashes and 3 air jumps. These are reset when landing, either on ground, a spaceship\u00a0or enemy wreckage.</p>\n<p>-\"Fly Mode\" requires holding the button. Toggle option will be added later.</p>\n<p>-You can't cancel Fly Mode or Dashes into Attacks yet. You can still perform an attack the instant you release the Fly Mode trigger or once the dash impulse ends.</p>\n<p>-Attacking with no nearby enemy or direction pressed will attack upwards.</p>\n<p>-Yawing in Fly Mode is not very effective. Use Roll and Pitch to be a badass.</p>\n<p>-There are no limits on Attacking or Flying. Obviously this is completely broken.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/174/174377b4043c2050d75ed87dcb349176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bunnybreaker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
