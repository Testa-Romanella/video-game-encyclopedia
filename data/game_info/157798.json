Independent animations for the background, borders and menus all made with assets that you get with unity by default with the exception of music.\u00a0\u00a0Bricks repopulate after they are all destroyed so you can keep going until you run out of lives. Enjoy!!!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move paddle left and right with A, D or Left Arrow Key and Right Arrow Key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Launch the ball with space.
