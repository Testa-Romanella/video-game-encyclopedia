Pix, being the only one left who knows how to stop them must reach the factory core and shut it down.</p>\n<p>(this is just a demo, a full version of the game will be released on google play and steam if i get enough funding, as I need illustrators for backgrounds, textures and characters).</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs you encounter in the comments. The more people contribute to debugging the faster I can finish it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af6c6c0c8f35f7c627cf0ab452819cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Electric Cat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
