I have been working on this game for some days recently after the long hiatus I took from game development. I wanted to get back into it and start experimenting on new tools! While I plan on working more on this game. The tool I am going to use is still not fully chosen. I would like to get some feedback from you dear player on how does the game feel and does it look like a generic game so I can make it more unique and interesting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T03:07:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/585dde4c887489d1e044d5913b3c2c4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Game Slayer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
