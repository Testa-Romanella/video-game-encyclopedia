The main feature of the game is that each character moves relative to the direction they are facing. This means that if you instruct the characters to move left, they do not move to the left relative to the camera. Instead, they move left relative to the direction they are facing.\u00a0This makes for some interesting puzzle situations as you attempt to orchestrate a battle between the forces of red, blue, green, and yellow.<br/></p>\r\nVersion\r\n<p>Current version: 1.0</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please share them with me by posting a comment here or on the devlog.
