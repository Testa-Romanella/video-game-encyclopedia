{"id": 118118, "slug": "the-stanley-parody", "name": "The Stanley Parody", "name_original": "The Stanley Parody", "description": "<p>Welcome to the crosshairs of a good old children's fairytale and a cool meta-themed game!<br/>In this 10-minute contraption I invite you to walk Stanley the donkey through a few decisions and ridiculous scenarios; multiple endings and hidden narration included.</p>\n<p>Be warned that WebGL sometimes has an issue where mouse movement is jittery while moving. Some textures may also look strange. I thus recommend that you download and play the Windows build for best experience.</p>\n<p>But first of all, go ahead and play The Stanley Parable if you haven't already.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is the second prototype built for <em>Comp3218 Game Design and Development</em> by:</p>\n<ul><li>Teo Nistor</li><li>Mircea Mihalea</li></ul>\n<p>Let's see how good a mark it gets us.</p>\n<p>P.S. It has been brought to my attention that there is a place where you can walk out of the map, so look forward to that if you like to dig for glitches. Hope the lecturers won't find it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f2d8301e16c809d562c5e3e0fd72a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["teonistor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
