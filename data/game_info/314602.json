It actually does not matter on what platform these games were released, what kind of graphics and sound design was there (and whether it was at all!).</p>\n<p>One of these games was \"Alley Cat\", which was released in 1983, first on Atari, and in 1984 on PC. The idea of this arcade game is quite simple: you control an alley cat that can move along the street, jump on trash cans and a fence. By jumping from the fence, he can get inside the building, in every room of which another adventure awaits him: either empty all the food from the dog feeders, catch all the fish in the fishbowl, eat the canary in a birdcage, thoughtlessly left by the owners in dangerous proximity to the window or something else. Each room has its own task.</p>\n<p>The cat's life is complicated by dogs, darting down the street and in the house, spiders and brooms. After each adventure, the cat can pay a visit to a girlfriend (of course, if he will be able to get through the complex maze to her attic!).</p>\n<p>Game works on\u00a048k and 128k ZX Spectrum (which includes nice AY music). It has support for Kempston, Sinclair Joystick or Keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Buy the Physical edition at MatraNet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/137/137a316ae1bf528455c1d9dce10408d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jordi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
