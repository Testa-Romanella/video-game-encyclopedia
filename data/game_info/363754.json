This game is about as dumb as it sounds. A simulation of all the frustration and joy that comes with finding a needle inside a haystack. You have a limited amount of hay you can remove, so dig wisely! If a block flashes green when you try to remove it, that means the needle is hiding on it. Keep an eye out for shovels. I don't know who left their shovels in there but make use of them because they allow you to remove more hay before you lose. <br/></p>\n<p>Needles you've found are collected on the right side of the screen and times you've failed to find the needle are tallied on the left. You can click on a needle on the right to give it up for a few more chances to remove hay from your current haystack.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and have a good time!<br/></p>\n<p>In-game font-m6x11, Daniel Linssen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e127fa3fb93886d9a20c49bb830e63a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bungus Productions"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
