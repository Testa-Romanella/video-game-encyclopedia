You're looking for your wife who went out in an Archaelogical expedition and never returned. All indications point she found the lost tomb of Arawn and the entrance to the mythical world of Annwn.\u00a0 By following her tracks you end up venturing deeper and deeper through underground tunnels. With no way back the only solution seems to be going further down. But something lies in the darkness, and in the silence you can hear unsettling bells coming closer.</p>\n<p>First solo portfolio game. Worked hard to polish it as much as i can but let me know if you encounter any bugs. Any feedback is also appreciated.\u00a0 Released new update with some bugs fixed.</p>\n\n<p>Textures:</p>\n<p>Rock pattern photo created by kues1 - www.freepik.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T09:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef4/ef4662bde8a279e600da84602775cfa6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Migamcb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
