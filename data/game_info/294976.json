Since data connections are very brittle near the earth orbit, you'll have to <strong>communicate by voice</strong> where each of the subjects lives and when exactly to enable and disable the Tractor beam. Be careful to not hurt anyone!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, and your home planet sends you a pretty <strong>continous stream of subjects</strong> to dispatch to earth, so you should probably <strong>hurry up</strong> a bit.</p>\r\n\r\nGlobal Game Jam\r\n<p>Originally done in a <strong>team of five</strong> for the Global\u00a0Game Jam 2019.

This causes all kinds of interesting issues and crashes, most notably that currently the VR Pilot has to live without some postprocessing effects and the game crashes on exit. Well.
