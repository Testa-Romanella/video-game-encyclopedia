To respect the theme the narrator would be saying \"eh their is no way to get out\" such as theirisnogame game, so that is a lie their is a way to get out.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT, <em>due to unforeseen circumstances\u00a0</em>we didn't have the time to finish it and do what we expected. We made some scripts such as the narator dialog system that isn't shown here because of this lack of time...</strong></p>\n<p>I don't know if i will redo this game idea entierly and properly in the futur.
