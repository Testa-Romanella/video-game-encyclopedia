Ensure you dish out the correct drinks to your paying customers, or else you will recieve an insurmountable loss of funds.\"</p>\n<p>HappyCoffeeLLC is a game I've been working on for about a week now, and is something I'll continue to put hours into in the near future. It is supposed to be a comedy-horror puzzle game, where you need to navigate an archaic, confusing text-based interface to create cups of coffee out of thin air. As the game progresses, methods for making drinks become harder, and questions about what exactly this strange HappyCoffeeLLC corporation - or this strange black &amp; white world - really is.</p>\n<p>This prototype will take around 15 minutes to complete. It consists of serving 9 customers in total. No gameplay is final - some things may be too frustrating or just plain not fun, so I'm willing to tweak anything. I also haven't begun writing any sort of story at all. I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:40:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/530a28e51335998f6100caaf4649886d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aiden Meyer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
