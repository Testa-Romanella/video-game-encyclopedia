The gameplay is simple, go through three linear levels in this 2D platformer, timing jumps properly to make it to the end. The twist on this however is that the primary obstacle the player has to deal with is their own trigger finger.</p>\n<p>You see every time you fire a shot out of your arm cannon the shot will keep flying until it hits something, in which case it'll just bounce back and continue the cycle ad nauseam until either player death or success.\u00a0 The tricky aspect of this is that while the shots can damage and destroy certain blocks to help allow you to continue traversing, they can also bounce right back at you for an untimely demise. The strategy of guns-blazing, while still possible, will make the game all the more challenging so it's highly encouraged to hold your fire and make strategic shots.</p><p>Sprites by Ansimuz</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/2826a7fc649ddf82ab899e902bac3e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaredBronstein"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
