I am not affiliated with the makers of that game in any way.</p><p>UPDATE: I found the clip I based this all on! Try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTBBRcUIEEI at the 1:12:47 mark.<br/></p><p>The instructions are found on-screen.</p><p>You can, if you want, say aloud things like this while playing:</p><p>- \"Whoa! There are cards all *over* the place!  I'm gonna pick 'em up.\"<br/>- \"There's a five of hearts underneath this table!  I'm gonna pick it up.\"<br/>- \"There's a jack of clubs on the sofa!  I'm gonna pick it up.\"</p><p>-------</p><p>Made solo (code- and sfx-wise) in 48 hours (actually, more like 20, all told) for the Ludum Dare 37 compo (er, jam.  Turns out I misread the rules regarding assets for the compo.)<br/></p><p>Made with Godot 2.1.1, which I downloaded at the beginning of LD37. I had never tried Godot before. It's not perfect (let me know if you find something that is!) but there are a lot of things that are quite easy to accomplish with it, e.g. sound.</p><p>I also used Bfxr, Audacity, and ImageMagick.</p><p>The following assets I found here and there with licences that, as I understood, I could use in a non-commercial game:</p><p>- Music: www.bensound.com<br/>- Sofa: Yurii Burdukh<br/>- Table: Gela Motskobili<br/>- Floor: opengameart.org<br/>- Wallpaper: public domain</p><p>The tagline quote I took from the Video Games section of http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/Too_Incompetent_to_Operate_a_Blanket<br/></p><p>-------</p><p>CHANGELOG</p><p>1.0.1: mouse inversion is now optional, and off by default</p><p>1.0.2: arrow keys also work, as a fix for non-QWERTY keymaps<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed4659ea106b609c73af94d550c5ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IBwWG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
