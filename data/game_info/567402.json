Was it an antenna, or something else? With your camera and your keen eye, seek out evidence of aliens, but don't let your guard down. Don't miss a detail, since the only thing between you and a bloody end, is your ability to look closely, and scare it away with a flash of your camera. If it watches you for too long, god help you.<br/><br/>I started this project at the beginning of the game jam a bit less than a month ago\u00a0with a decision: stick with Gamemaker Studio 2, or move to Unreal Engine 4 and learn it from scratch. Considering the circumstances,\u00a0I'd say my first attempt at Unreal went surprisingly well. I'm proud of it, and I worked tirelessly on it, nonstop, and I feel pretty good about it. Now I'm definitely not distributing it on steam\u00a0yet though, I'm keeping it for now until I can develop it into a state I'm truly proud of.\u00a0As hard as I worked, right now I admit it's not that great. In a vacuum, it's a pretty mediocre game.\u00a0However, after the game jam I'll have plenty of time to improve upon it, so expect a much better version of this game at some point in the future.<br/><br/>I do want to mention that I acknowledge there's a certain exploit in the game that you may find by playing it long enough. I won't spoil it here, but I'm aware it's there, so there will definitely be some major changes to the core gameplay when I improve upon it. Still, there are many hidden strategies in the game, so I definitely encourage seeking them out.\u00a0<br/>For what progress I <em>did </em>end up making in this short time, I hope people have fun with it, and I hope it scares the pants off you.<br/><br/>Contributor: Alli Feamster, music<br/>Contributor: Ericka Padilla, voice acting<br/><br/>Credits:</p><p>Alien SFX:\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets?s=sound<br/>Alien Model: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/alien?sessionInvalidated=...<br/>City Models: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/asheville-low-poly-city<br/>Ambiance: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/darkness-ambience-vol2<br/>All camera sounds are random stock sounds I found through youtube videos and websites I forgot to record.
