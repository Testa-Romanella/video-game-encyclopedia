The goal of the app is to enrich and  improve your knowledge of middle-school math topics. Nonetheless, this  app is suited for all ages as it covers a variety of topics with  examples and contains no ads or in-app purchases.\r\n </p>\n<p>Topics are purposely kept short so that  you can study for just 10 minutes a day but still be ready for school.
