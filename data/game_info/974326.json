Feed the Ducks.</strong><br/><br/>You play as an Orthodox Christian monastic who has gone to their favorite lakeside to pray and feed the ducks. With prayer rope in hand and pocket full of peas (bread is bad for their digestion), humbly quiet your heart while caring for the least of God's creatures.<br/><br/>Pixel Monk is a casual game about acquiring a peaceful spirit: an experience players can enjoy through interactive background elements and ambient sounds. The game features two leisurely actions: Pray, and Feed the Ducks, both of which interact with the environment in different ways. Players can also mix a variety of calming sounds, toggle daytime and weather, and cycle through inspirational quotes from the Bible and Orthodox Saints.<br/><br/>In Pixel Monk you can choose between:<br/><br/><ul><li> Male or Female Monastic (with option for Angelic Schema robe)<br/></li><li> 10 Classical Piano songs<br/></li><li> 5 Mixable Ambient Sounds: Ducks, Wind, Rain, Frogs, Crickets<br/></li><li> 4 Orthodox Christian Icons: Christ, Theotokos, Venerable Monk, Holy Virgin<br/></li><li> 50+ quotes from Holy Scripture and Orthodox Saints<br/></li><li> Launch the game during Orthodox feast days (Old or New Calendar) to find special Icons and background items.</li></ul><br/>Pixel Monk is ultimately an experience, aimed at inspiring that same experience in the real world. In the hustle and bustle of life we may not always get to retreat to our favorite place to find peace, but we hope that Pixel Monk can bring players a small part of that peace until then.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T07:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b4cd3d416acd06132bae19d790b7774.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Trisagion Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Trisagion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
