[hella jank]</p>\n<p>The game is kinda easy on default settings. Tweak the CPU difficulty to your liking in the OPTIONS area. I recommend a lv4 CPU and at least 5 block types</p>\n<p>you can pretty much figure out the rest.</p>\n<p>Please comment any bugs or suggestions please :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T03:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd11ac2f9e1045455328c6c7bc555ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Weeklylight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
