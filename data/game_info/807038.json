They\u2019ll always interact with what\u2019s in front of them, even if it\u2019s a chewed up piece of gum. So toss them a ladder, dig a path, place a bridge, or blast a wall. Get them home safely in this medium skill platformer. Use your brain, they won\u2019t use theirs!<h3>Medium skill platforming</h3><br/>Nummels can do anything you can do as long as they have the right motivation, but you can run faster and jump higher. This is not a punishingly difficult platformer, but there are challenges for those that want them.<h3>Go fast to get on the leaderboard</h3><br/>It's fine to take your time and set everything up before letting them loose, but to get good scores and unlock all the things, you'll need to go fast.<h3>Accessorize</h3><br/>Get coins by saving Nummels and spend them on cool hats!<br/><br/><br/>A few Nummels may have been harmed during the production of this game.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T05:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a7/8a70db0a98caacf2148ff07452687dc2.jpg", "website": "https://www.nummels.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Plattnip"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plattnip"], "esrb_rating": null}
