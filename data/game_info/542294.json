You can only hold two pieces at a time, represented by the number in the bottom left.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The Story</strong><br/>You made a mistake that put you in front of a judge. The judge gave you a choice: prison or community service. Naturally, you chose community service, thinking you'd have to plant a couple trees or paint a school or something. When they told you you'd be picking up trash on the highway, you thought that wasn't too bad. What they failed to mention was that you'd be picking up trash during peak traffic times!</p>\n<p><strong>Notes<br/></strong>This game is a small prototype, consisting of only two levels (for now). If you'd like to see more, leave a comment or let me know on Twitter!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:43:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8cabd03e17669ac4c3d5dbf88d1e1b99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Golly Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
