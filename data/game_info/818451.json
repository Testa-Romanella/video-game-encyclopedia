As you try to escape, chess pieces attack you. In this dimension, everything runs on a cycle, like a turn-based game: after you make your move, the enemies will make theirs. In order to get more powerful, you must unlock all six faces of your die, unleashing a variety of attack, movement, and protection abilities. But make sure to watch out, there is one unlock-able face that does more harm than good.</strong>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys -\u00a0<strong>Move</strong></p>\n<p>C -\u00a0<strong>Progress Text</strong></p>\r\nCredits:<p>(We barely had any time to work this weekend, but this is what we could get finished!
