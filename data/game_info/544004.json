At The Bottling Plant!</p>\n<p>There's a lack of workers so two daring employees need to keep things running and the trucks loaded!<br/>Move the employees with W/S and Up/Down. If they are next to a pallet, they will move it to where it's supposed to be.<br/>Careful! The old bottling machine is frequently breaking down and you will have to do some plumbing to get it up and running again, before the pressure is too high! Do so by clicking on any misbehaving pipe.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T08:30:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea48693ff4b63ff55d07bf1cbe72e3d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deps"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
