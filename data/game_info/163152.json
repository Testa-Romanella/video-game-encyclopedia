All you need is a mouse, with the ability for a really high CPM (Clicks Per Minute), although you'll need a finger to accompany it. Escape gets you back to the main page and quits if you're there.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Post Development Comments</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Find and Click; that was the theme for the second Game A Week. Liking the 2D space and 3D object mix from last week's game (see shovel) I was interested to bring that into this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It started with a nice simple array (a bit of code that puts a bunch of squares on the screen at organized but random points) and blew up from there. As it went on however I found that it was a very linear style of game making meaning there was no replay-ability. So I added a few very stupidly designed bits that kind of suck but hard to beat\u00a0</p>\n<p>Point being, it's short. It's short and gets really BS the further along you get.</p>\n<p><strong>Where To From Here</strong></p>\n<p>No where really. It's complete. Sure bumping up the some of those aesthetics, adding some cool effects and expanding it might be \u00a0beneficial but that not the point, I'd rather take it back before pushing it forward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a88908b368d7bf42e6d3e5251895f8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamTheSomebody"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
