You are a Rebel, one who does not conform to societal norms. Those who resist and rise against oppression at all costs, firmly identifying with who you are.

An abilities system that does not confine you to one single playstyle but many.<br/></p>\r\nCOMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER\r\n<p>Compete against opposite teams in PVP with numerous game modes. Here you can showcase your builds against others with unique gear, abilities and playstyles<br/></p>\r\nAWESOME REPLAYABILITY\r\n<p>The looter shooter genre itself offers replayable content due to the obsessive nature of the loot grind for the best gear.
