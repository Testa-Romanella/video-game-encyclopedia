This is a game I made for the Black and White Jam #8.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is about moving a bot that is constantly looping in one direction. You're main goal is to get it to the full white door\u00a0by moving objects around like springs, blocks and Direction\u00a0Changers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I didn't get too much time to work on this Jam as I have been busy with Uni work. This is also my first jam so please bare that in mind since there is still a few bugs and I didn't manage to get any audio in.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:36:38", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mitchell MacPherson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
