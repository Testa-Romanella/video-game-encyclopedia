The war waged on and on until King Illam I of Illamius finally bested the three kingdoms of Sturmheim, Stynvale, and Wes'Salim on the planes of battle and united the world under Illamian law and banner. The peace has been held for two generations until\u00a0<br/>Illam I's grandson - Illam III - decided that he values glory and conquest over peace. Through taxation and tribute, Illam III has provoked the other rulers more and more as time has gone by. Now, relations between the kingdoms are strained and the world is again on the brink of war.\u00a0<br/><br/>The story follows the apprentice Rhone and her allies as they attempt to become mages of the Illamian empire. When their certification exam goes awry, they must travel the world and face many foes in order to be recognized as \"Court Mages\" - and hopefully they can achieve this feat before the world is torn by a new war of the four kingdoms.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2ec69bdf7e9ec86b253c3016552ff20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["shyAwayGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
