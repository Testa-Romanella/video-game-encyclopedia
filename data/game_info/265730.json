{"id": 265730, "slug": "quest-of-heroes", "name": "Quest Of Heroes!", "name_original": "Quest Of Heroes!", "description": "<p>Quest Of Heroes is a short, experimental game inspired by classic JRPG's such as the Dragon Quest series!<br/></p>\n<p>You play as the Hero, a man who sets out on a quest to obtain rare &amp; powerful items in order to aid you in your journey to live out your destiny by defeating The Demon King and restoring peace to The Realm!</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>*When starting the game, press Escape and scroll down to System. Go into System and change Screen Type to Windowed mode, as Full Screen mode is poorly optimized.</p>\n<p>Hints:<br/>*Once you have defeated the Dragon and gotten the Golden Sword, return to town and go to the shop. Sell your old Iron Sword and the Key you received from the King (but make sure you have retrieved the Power Orb from the Dungeon before you sell the Key). Use your Gold to buy Hearts until you have 10 Gold left. Use the Hearts in your Inventory to increase your maximum health, and then use your last 10 Gold and stay at the inn. This will restore your health and should give you more than enough health to battle the Demon King.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>*ASCII Corporation for creating the RPG Maker 95 engine, as well as all the graphics and sounds used.</p>\n<p>*Eyezmaze for inspiration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f643e1cd8b8f87c0aaad4fe359e15de2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyclone Sword Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
