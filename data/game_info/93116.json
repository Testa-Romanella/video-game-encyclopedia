Millions of people all over the world have fallen unconscious. Scientists are baffled. No one can seem to find a correlation between everyone who vanished. But things are even more mysterious for our good friend Jack. When he goes online to check on his community, he finds thousands of messages containing nothing but two words: SAVE US.

There are puzzles and such but it does take its time to tell a full story and we did our best to make it immersive with interesting characters and dialogue. That being said, if you're looking for a fast paced adventure or a difficult puzzle game with complex mechanics, this game isn't for you. However, if you like games with lots of lovable characters and an immersive story, you'll love this game.</p>\n<p>Please be advised that this may be a slightly outdated copy of the game.
