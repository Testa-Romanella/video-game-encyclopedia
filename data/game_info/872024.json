The dull silence is cut by a phone call from a man with a familiar voice. The gruff voice urges you to \"come quickly, they're all gone.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>Disturbed, you get in your car, and suddenly you're standing in the dimly lit foyer of someone's home. The place is empty, like everyone just got up and left. There's an awful stench in the air but you can't make out what it is. All you can hear is the sound of the wind and tree branches crashing against the side of the house, and a faint ticking noise.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Suddenly you feel an icy cold presence shoot through your body as your vision fades and your body washes with fear. You're paralyzed lying on the reeking, damp ground; through half-open eyes you see a tall figure wielding a harsh blade standing over you. The being opens its mouth as if to speak and all that comes out is the blood-curdling screeching of metal on metal. <br/></p>\r\nSYSTEM SPECS\r\n<p><strong>Recommended</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or later</li><li>1 GB RAM</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Minimum<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dedicated GPU with DX11 or Vulkan support</li><li>1 GB RAM</li></ul>\r\nNOTES\r\n<ul><li>Press F10 during gameplay to view controls list.</li><li>Menu sliders don't reload their saved value upon reloading a menu; this isn't game breaking, but it does mean that when you enter a menu the sliders will reset.</li><li>Story progress can be reset via the Game Options menu.</li><li>All settings can be reset to defaults by deleting <strong>AppData\\Local\\Psychosis\\Saved\\Config</strong> and <strong>AppData\\Local\\Psychosis\\Saved\\SaveGames\\CustomGameUserSettings.sav<br/></strong></li><li>If you have issues running the game, try running the UE4 prerequisites setup file located at <strong>Engine\\Extras\\Redist\\en-us\\UE4PrereqSetup_x64.exe<br/></strong></li></ul>\r\nRegarding Linux\r\n<p>A Linux build for this is available to download. However, I was personally not able to get the Linux build to not crash, but that comes with the disclaimer that  I am not the slightest bit knowledgeable in running games on Linux. In any case, if you are able to get it working, please let us know here and on the Discord! It's worth noting that when testing the Linux build on Steam, using one of the Proton compatibility modes got me at least to the main menu.</p>\n<p>The Linux build uses Vulkan for rendering, so at the very least you'll need to use a GPU and drivers that support it.</p>\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n<p><strong>Content Warning: </strong>Psychosis contains themes of murder, flashing imagery, strong violence, and strong language.<br/></p>\r\nCREDITS<ul><li>Developed by Aaron Gilbert</li><li>Music composed by Richard Savery</li><li>Lighting contributions by Zachary Marik</li><li>Animation contributions by Daniel Hudson Newberry</li><li>Key art by Henri Tervapuro</li><li>Special thanks to Zachary Marik, David Hewitson, and the Haunted PS1 community without whom this never would have been possible</li></ul><p>Full credits can be found in the included README.txt and in-game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T10:38:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52df44cf9e426fa74ff3ca35b7448d3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Gilbert"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
