For now, just download the rom and run it in the emulator of your choice.</p><p>You are seeking the legend of Quacking Jack's gold. Good luck, traveller!</p><p>This is a short game of five stages, each only one room big. I intended to use more stages, and a title screen, however I had to cut them for compression reasons (i.e. I didn't use any).</p><p>Hope you enjoy.</p><p>Ludum dare page here:</p><p>http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=p...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/484dac8db99248a088fd4d7ccb138f4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["team_disposable"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
