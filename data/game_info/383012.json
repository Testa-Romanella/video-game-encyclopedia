Player must try to face the front armour of its tank towards the enemies to deflect shots.</p>\n<p>Armour angling is also recreated. Angling the armour increases relative armour, which means more protection.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- A and D to rotate</p>\n<p>- W and S to move</p>\n<p>- ESC to open menu</p>\n<p>Created by Lei Ye<br/>Art made with https://pixilart.com<br/>Sound effects from:<br/>https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/cannon-10077/<br/>https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/explosion-10070/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/jashstudios/sounds/184343/<br/>https://freesound.org/people/Iwiploppenisse/sounds/156031/<br/>https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/epic<br/>https://patrickdearteaga.com/action-music/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:02:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/920b8b891797963aed344794135db0e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["leiye1995"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
