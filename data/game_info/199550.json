It is a highscore game where points are awarded when two balls of matching color and size collide to create a larger ball. Use up, down, left and right to move the balls on those relative directions and achieve the highest score possible before running out of space. To free up space you can click to destroy a ball, but beware the cost of doing so may very well outweigh the benefit. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy and would love to know what you think! Find me on twitter @dnathrider</p><p>I have also written about the creation of this game at my blog on myunityjourney.wordpress.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49fa373fe1b3ab49b25c60ca407d5cd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["davidcnath"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
