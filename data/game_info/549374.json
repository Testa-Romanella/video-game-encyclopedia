{"id": 549374, "slug": "style-network", "name": "Style Network", "name_original": "Style Network", "description": "<p><strong>Opening:\u00a0</strong>This is a prototype that I worked on for exactly 1 week.\u00a0 It was a gameplay idea I had of combining the Battle Network gameplay style with a DMC Style Meter.\u00a0 I think for just a week's development time it came out pretty nice although it's still very rough around the edges.\u00a0 I spent that week creating all the sprites (my first time working with pixel art!), UI, images, etc.\u00a0 The only things not made by me are the backgrounds and the music. Check out the Strategy Guide in the zip file!</p>\n<p><strong>Game:\u00a0</strong>Take the role of my original character Cool, as you battle the evil color-changing Sucklet. You have 5 abilities at your disposal and a style meter.\u00a0 Increase the Style Meters rank by stringing together unique attacks. (tip: using a basic attack between each ability will make your Rank go up the fastest) Use the arrow keys to move!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Attack</strong> - Space Bar (no cooldown, 1 damage attack, helpful to juggle the Style Meter, should be strung together between abilities to increase Style Rank.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>(tip: the style meter will reset its rank after 7 seconds, but this timer is reset every time you land an attack on your enemy)</p>\n<p><strong>Sword</strong> - Q button (a 3-second cooldown, 60 damage attack, requires a Style Rank of E or greater to use, attacks the panel directly in front of you)</p>\n<p><strong>Wide Sword</strong> - W button (a 4-second cooldown, 80 damage attack, requires a Style Rank of C or greater to use, attacks the panel directly in front of you and the panel above that one)</p>\n<p><strong>Long Sword</strong> - E button (a 4-second cooldown, 100 damage attack, requires a Style Rank of A or greater to use, attacks the next 3 panels directly in front of you)</p>\n<p><strong>Big Gun</strong> - R button (Your ultimate ability, 200 damage attack, requires Style Rank of S, shoots a fast bullet that resets your Rank on use)</p>\n<p>(known bug: moving at the start of the game might cause you to move into enemy territory however pressing the arrows keys a bit will bring you back and you won't have the problem anymore)\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The goal for this creative exercise was to see what kind of game I can create in exactly 1 week's time, because of this deadline I wasn't able to get to all the things I wanted to add.\u00a0 Depending on the feedback I may go back and add those things at a later date and fully flesh out the concept. Because of this, all feedback is very appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Future Goals:</strong> If I was to continue working on this project here are some of the things I would like to add; More enemies, better visual clarity regarding abilities, a tutorial section explaining the style meter, impactful sound effects, more abilities/customization, more/better animations/sprite work, more effects for visual clarity.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T09:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/565/565b85670b7c9929cc32e69f09c7ca75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coolrelia"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
