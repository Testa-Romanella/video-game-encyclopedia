There are 6 different endings but in only one of them are you completely free. This is my first game and it took me 3 days to build. (It probably could've gone a lot faster if I was more programming savvy, which I hope to become in the near future.) Let me know what you thought of my game in the comments below. Donations are appreciated and go torwards my effort to build a new pc so that I can develop more complex games as my $200-$300 laptop is barely capable of running any 3d games. (I spelled congratulations wrong multiple times in this game and probably some other stuff too I realize that now i got lazy torwards the end and didn't feel like checking it.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fa/8fa88b9afda8694153b6111aae74d6c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Caddark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
