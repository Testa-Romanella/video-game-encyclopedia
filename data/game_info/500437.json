Although rigging and animations is done by me.</p>\n<p>Current build features a much more relentless enemy, I have no idea why.</p>\n<p>He doesn't act like that in the engine, I dunno, might be cursed. Probably more bugs than I have found myself. I have been messing with this for too long now, might as well post it.</p>\n<p>So just tell me what you think, I have no emotions so you can't hurt me.</p>\n<p>Some Behind the Scenes stuff:</p>\n<p>Music is made primarily by stretching drum samples, a really great way to create noisy spook sounds. Also alot of bitcrush and reverb on top.</p>\n<p>Voice acting is done by me, and some layering and effects.</p>\n<p>I was planning on having more assets in the game, but found the empty, liminal space aesthetic to be kind of unsettling. Or at least that is what I will tell my future employers.</p>\n<p>Some assets came from a previous project that never saw the light of day.</p>\n<p>\"Thing in the Dark\" took me an embarassingly long time to come up with, titles are hard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T06:54:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47e30c9c9b3c1befc718a9f3fe4f943.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yeastboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
