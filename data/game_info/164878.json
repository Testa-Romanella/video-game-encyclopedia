A (randomized) violation of human rights happens : you need to contact the Decider, someone who has the power to make a change. For example, a journalist was jailed in another country : you'll have to reach the Ambassador.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So each of your student is represented by a node, and you can interact with people/node you know and meet new people/node, or maybe tweet, start a petition, organise a protest, etc in order extend your network until you can reach the Decider.</p>\n<p>Made by :\u00a0<br/>Horace Ribout - GD and Lead programmation (nodes animation, graph system, randomized characters, etc)<br/>Aur\u00e9lien Mont\u00e9ro - Sound Design<br/>Arnaud - GD and programmation\u00a0<br/>Emmanuel - programmation<br/>Lorele\u00ef Simon - Lead GD and 2D Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/265da6033b9c3e5d754d033f33745b48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lorele\u00ef Simon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
