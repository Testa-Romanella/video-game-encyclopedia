Their eyes allow them to see beyond the human-perceptible colour spectrum into the ultra violet and they often inhabit liminal zones in the urban environment. Under bridges, on balconies, interlaced through the nooks and crannies that make up our world.</p>\n<p>London Fields is a part of East London - deep in history, and a place of constant change of renewal. Currently it is being heavily redeveloped - industrial warehouses and old terrace housing is being replaced with new developments, and the community is changing.</p>\n<p>This meditative experience combines site specific binaural sound recordings, photogrammetry, with the alterity of the pigeons POV.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0- How to play -<br/></p>\n<p>This is a Windows compatible EXE file, no installation necessary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Control is mouse and keyboard, mouse controls the direction POV and WSAD controls the direction of movement.
