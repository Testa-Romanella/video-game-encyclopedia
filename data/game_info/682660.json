From this spring's Monster Hunter: World, a game that has sold around 400 million copies worldwide, we were able to get the chance to speak to co-founder and CEO Tim Liebreich. The creator of the popular Monster Hunter series has been creating new games for console for a while, but it wasn't until this game that he saw the potential that the series has.<br/>\nIt's an interesting one that can be seen from a somewhat different angle, because he's talking about the gameplay and how you can use the weapons in the game to take down bosses.\n\n\"Monster Hunter being an open world game, it's got elements of linearity and randomness to it, which means it has the ability to be very open and a lot of people find that very interesting,\" Liebreich says, \"and I'm kind of in the same boat, so I wanted to try stuff I've never done before.\n\n\"I definitely knew how to approach this, and I'll speak more about that later, but the thing that I love most about Monster Hunter is that it's so open. It's the work of the players, it's the play of the players, it's the flow of the game. It's almost more like an experience game than a story game.\n\n\"The other thing that's really cool about this is that everything is hidden, so you can actually feel like you can unlock all the different stories, all the different side quests, all</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db7b15cd441553e4385d4e99021c6cbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
