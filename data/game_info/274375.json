Frogs create a clone when they eat.</p>\n<p>Pop balloons by clicking them to stop your frogs from overeating. Frogs who don't eat will die. But sometimes, sacrifices must be made.</p>\n<p>The tree will stop making fruit if it runs out of leaves.</p>\n<p>The game ends if all of your frogs die or your tree runs out of leaves.</p>\n<p>Try to make the biggest colony possible and survive the longest!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<p>There's a lot of interaction here re: the growth rate of leaves, berries, and frogs. I haven't done the math so I wouldn't expect it to be super balanced. If you've got suggestions or tips I'd love to hear them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14a/14af9fe77ab63365882642a9ecab1185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["John Watson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
