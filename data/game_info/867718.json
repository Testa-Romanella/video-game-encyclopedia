At first, they will move around the map invisibly, only showing signs of their presence via meows, ghostly paw prints and hairballs, scratch marks appearing on furniture out of nowhere, and sudden drops in temperature. As you use these signs alongside your notes, you will piece together what cat type you are dealing with, and how to appease each one.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>WASD- Movement\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right-Click- UV\u00a0</p>\n<p>E- Interact\u00a0</p>\n<p>1-3- Select Tools\u00a0</p>\n<p>4-6 Select Objects\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left-Click- Use Selection\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Carson Cole- Environmental Artist, UX Artist\u00a0</p>\n<p>Duncan Glynn- Level Designer, Level Programmer, Mechanics Programming\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nikolaus Johnson- UX Programmer, Level Programmer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jerin Smith- Level Programmer, Sound Design, Gameplay Design, Mechanics Programming</p>\n<p>\u00a0Max Eddington- Character Artist, Gameplay Designer, UX Artist</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/913/913513872f23796d17786a43a0b42646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["rakthalekk"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
