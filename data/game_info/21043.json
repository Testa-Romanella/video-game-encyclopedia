Click here to get it.</strong><br/><br/>A quiet night, the heavens above, and a tale waiting to be told.<br/><br/>Star Sky is a unique and personable experience. From the first moment that you step into the game, you become the narrator of a methodically slow-paced story you choose to weave with every step. Those who rush from start to finish will miss all the secrets and choices woven into the world: you must learn to be patient. Audio cues and blink-of-an-eye visuals will let you know when the magic is about to occur, be sure not to miss it!<br/><br/>From the mind and heart of M\u00e5rten Jonsson, Star Sky unfolds like a beautiful poem that tells a different saga every time. Dodging the traditional conventions of gameplay, Star Sky can instead be enjoyed through its ambiance, the atmospheric sensations, and the satisfaction that the player creates with each conclusion. You may not always understand, but remember that this game takes place in the restless night. All the constraints of the story are as limitless as the sky itself.<br/><br/>Goodnight, and may you find what you're seeking beneath the stars.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23d/23d78ed8aec9691c0474230c32d57460.jpg", "website": "http://www.jm-j.com/starsky", "rating": 2.71, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 110, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["M\u00e5rten Jonsson", "JMJ Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM"], "esrb_rating": null}
