It's got a nice feel to hover cart which is why I didn't add a motive; I want you to enjoy playing around with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Post Development Comments</strong></p>\n<p>Physics Engine; that was the theme for the fourth Game A Week. It found a really basic hover tutorial in the Unity docs and expanded from there. I was really happy with the result \u00a0too, it's got a nice scope for a week and works as intended.</p>\n<p>I don't have much else to say about this one, it was nice to make and had a surprisingly smooth development process. Sure the randomly spawning ramps are clunky but that's just being too finicky for something I would probably take out if I were to work on it more.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Where To From Here</strong></p>\n<p>I learnt all about procedural generation in game a week number five (see camera), so think adding that in would be really fun.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/030/0302cfcf919d897baefc14c9f9de0578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SamTheSomebody"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
