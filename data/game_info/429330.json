Well those are the results. So... let's begin with introduction!</p>\n<p>You are this cute little guy:\u00a0\u00a0! It is a tiny color-changing, electricity powered robot, that can hover in the air by using his stored energy. That energy is represented by little bar in the top left corner and by a color of the robot when hovers. Green = Good!</p>\n<p>To survive you need to get more energy! Pick up this:\u00a0! It is a battery that will give you +60 energy for your little buddy. Those are key to survival!<br/><br/>Your goal is to go as far as you can and get as many score as you can!</p>\n<p>You control your robot by pressing:<br/>- A - Move left<br/>- D - Move right<br/>- W - Hover<br/>- J - Shoot<br/></p>\n<p>Why he shoots you ask? Well it's simple. The evil Eye Monsters\u00a0 are coming fast in the robot's direction. You could dodge them... But you can also shoot 'em down!</p>\n<p>The Combo is very important. It multiplies your score gain. You can gain combo by:<br/>collecting\u00a0orand destroying\u00a0.<br/></p>\n<p>Be cereful! You miss one\u00a0and your combo is going back to x1.<br/></p>\n<p>Reach combo 10x and more for an amazing effect!</p>\n<p>You lose when the robot hits the bottom side of the screen or he is destroyed by\u00a0\u00a0.<br/><br/>Good luck and share your score in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e7/0e74255720603db9dc7fbd56b075d5cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DarianGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
