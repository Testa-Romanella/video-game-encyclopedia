{"id": 196116, "slug": "playne", "name": "PLAYNE", "name_original": "PLAYNE", "description": "<p>An indie game designed to help you to find calm, find balance and get grounded.Fox will teach you meditation and guide you through mindfulness, but it is you who must meditate to make the sun rise, to grow the trees, to bring balance back to Playne. Created by BAFTA nominated film-maker.</p>\r\nWhy Early Access?\r\n<p>We are super small team - so rolling out features takes a bit of time. Playne is also in uncharted territory in terms of genre so there will be a bit more experimentation (than normal) to get things right and feedback will be critical to the success of Playne.<br/>So until all these features come together, Playne will be an early access game. Thank you Itch :)</p>\r\nHow is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?\r\n<p>The early access version is a demonstration of the core principle, a game which helps you learn and practise mindfulness. The story and the game world has enough content to give you guys a good idea of what is possible. The full version will have more content and gameplay features. Specifically, more lore and more meditations.</p>\r\nWhat is the current state of the Early Access version?<p>The early access version is a demonstration of the core principle, a game which helps you learn and practise mindfulness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cb5ebb227e5aa2ba618c1a6e498564a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["playne"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
