There are seven puzzle rooms to get through to complete the game, you have the ability to push and pull crates around.</p>\n\n<p>The game takes about 10-20 minutes to playthrough. The game was made in unity with C#, blender and makehuman were also used.<br/></p>\n<p>When I think opposites I think magnets and magnetism so I wanted to create a game around that. I had a few days to work on this, very pleased we had more time to complete the game.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few things I would have  done better if I had more time. More sound effects, a not broken outline around the objects, the cube outline worked in the editor but not the build and the player outline worked when he was a test box but now when an animated human model. Animations are a bit clunky, the world is not fully fleshed out with details and extra objects.</p>\n<p>I hope to fix these issues stated above, as well as add some extra planned features that I did not have time to add and release a newer more refined version of this in a few months, I also have more story plans on how the game can be extended and plans for a co-op mode where you have to help each other through the level.</p>\n\n<p>Assets that were not created during the game jam are, the door model which I brought from TurboSquid a year ago, the outline effect which is a free asset on the unity asset store, the metal textures for the walls and crate which are from textures.com, the magnet sound effect which is from the Sonniss GDC audio pack and the background music which is a Kevin MacLeod song called \"SCP-x7x (6th Floor)\" Everything else was modelled, animated, textured and coded by me within the jam time.<br/></p>\r\n\"SCP-x7x (6th Floor)\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&lt;/a&gt;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/074/074f94f22b2bfae4983e3bb49cbe02b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fortstudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
