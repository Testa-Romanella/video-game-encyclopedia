We pitch this as \"Goldeneye 007\" meets \"Metal Gear Solid\" in an immersive VR world. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe full game features 15 objective-based missions and 200 Virtual Challenges.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-12T01:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa45c248c2fe9b297a967aa7d87d8077.jpg", "website": "http://espirevr.com", "rating": 1.71, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 171, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 41, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Espire VR"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Espire VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
