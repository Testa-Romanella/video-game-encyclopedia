Pull it, loosen it, and unravel yourself to make your way to the chain's source and move on to the next level.

Please let me know what parts have potential, which bits dragged, how the difficulty feels,\u00a0and whether you'd be likely to play through a much longer (and nicer looking) version.</p><p>KNOWN ISSUE: Sometimes jumps are treated as short hops regardless of how long you hold the button.
