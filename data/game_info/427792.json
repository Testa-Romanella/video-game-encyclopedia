You turn and see a hideous bug-eyed zombie wielding a copper frying pan and charging right at you. Instinctively,  you throw a nearby rock at the undead creature \u2014 and down he goes!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u201cHey, that was kinda FUN. What happens if I combine a rock and sticky snail snot?\u201c<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis first-person wave defense game is built for maximum fun for one, or groups of two, three, or four. Knockback is filled with magical weapons that enable you to eliminate zombies in your own personal ways.  Work with your buddies and have fun defending against hordes of zombies, keep from being overwhelmed, last out all the rounds, and kill the boss for the win.  And it\u2019s all about how you do it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKnockback is a physics sandbox that challenges you to ask yourself  \u201chow many ways can I destroy the zombies?\u201d Go ahead play with fire! Throw \u2019em into a building or smash \u2019em with a log rolling down a hill. Wanna suck the zombies into a tight ball and zap \u2018em with lightning? You can do that. Rain down sticky stones of fire onto their heads? Gotcha covered. Hit \u2018em with a giant rolling stone that bowls down the baddies? Go for it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow get out there and stick a snail snot rock to an unsuspecting zombie chin!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T08:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67bf593b22aa323e1397cb6af1d1cd8.jpg", "website": "http://www.knockbackgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Plucky Rat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plucky Rat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
