It's a realistic 3D simulation of the real table game.<br/><br/>You have full control over the puck - speed, direction, and point of release.  That means it'll take some practice to play well.  Hone your skill against the 7 levels of A.I. opponent as you advance from Beginner to Zen Master.<br/><br/>A.I. OPPONENTS<br/>There are 7 levels of A.I. to beat.  They get more accurate as you advance.  They also get more aggressive, sometimes choosing to attack your pucks if it means taking the lead.  You'll need a strategy to beat the Masters.<br/><br/>2-PLAYER WIFI GAME<br/>You can play against a friend or nearby random stranger.  Both of you need to have wifi turned on.  (You don't need to be connected to a network - just have your wifi on.)<br/><br/>FUN STUFF<br/>Motion Streaks \u2022 Fast moving pucks looks even faster.<br/>Homing Pucks \u2022 Guide themselves toward your enemy.<br/>Do-Overs \u2022 Re-throw your puck when you really need it.<br/>Instant Replay \u2022 Re-live that game-winning shot again and again.<br/>Pick Your Puck \u2022 Now, 5 designs to choose from!<br/>Fast-Forward \u2022 For when that realistic friction is taking too long.<br/><br/>TIPS &amp; TRICKS<br/>From someone who's played more than 1,000 games...<br/>\u2022 Lay your phone or iPad on a flat surface instead of holding in your hand<br/>\u2022 Don't move it around while you play, especially don't twist it<br/>\u2022 Fling your puck with a finger (not your thumb)<br/>\u2022 Get your forearm and wrist in the game (not just your finger)<br/>\u2022 Touch your puck, then drag it around a little before you fling it<br/>\u2022 Don't just put your finger down and fling it immediately<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun making this game and play-testing it.
