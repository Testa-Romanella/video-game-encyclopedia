The game has a singleplayer mode, where players alone try to escape from the robots and do the same together with friends in the multiplayer mode. All actions are performed from the first person perspective.</p>\n<p>Players need to escape from Hunters, robots dressed like victorian-age gentlemen and their assistants: robodogs or worse. Robots must find and kill all players to get out of the island on which the action of the game unfolds. The landscape of the island is different during each playthrough - procedurally generated mechanics help to do so: the game engine chooses from five main themes - from the countryside to industrial areas.</p>\n<p>Players need to look for food and weapons to survive, besides, to spare parts for transport. The latter serves as the only way out of the island. Most of the game process is within the genre of stealth, so do not expect dazzling action from this game.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2013-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-18T21:03:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/648/648691c034ae3b62794c7f16b2b179d7.jpg", "website": "http://www.big-robot.com/", "rating": 2.91, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 1419, "beaten": 29, "toplay": 17, "dropped": 72, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 93, "suggestions_count": 543, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 94, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Big Robot"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Big Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
