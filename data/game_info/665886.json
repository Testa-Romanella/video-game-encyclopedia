The idea was inspired by the arcade game Big Buck Hunter where all you do is hunt animals, but in this game they hunt you back. To help along the way you can unlock guns and upgrade your stats\u00a0to help survive immense waves of the animal hordes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was the final project for my Programming in game engines class. This was my first time making a 3D game in Unity and I had a blast.
