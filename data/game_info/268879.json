She has never, ever, had a single pet, as her parents think that she\u2019s not ready for such a big responsibility. This makes her sad, as her greatest desire is to be able to play and share special moments with a playful puppy of her own. She\u2019d love to play with a cute bouncing bunny. <br/><br/>Feeling sad and lonely, Abi is crying in her bedroom, which is painted in pretty pink and has a piano, a small toy kitchen and some teddy bears. She also has a farm with seven cows, five pigs, 14 chickens and heaps of frogs, but they don\u2019t really count because they\u2019re all in her iPad. What Abi really wants is a real pet. <br/><br/>Abi\u2019s bedroom is on the second floor of the house and, as her bed is beside the window, she can see the street and some neighboring houses. After gazing outside for a few minutes, she sees a grey cat swishing its tail while slowly strolling along from one side of the street to the other as if it owns the whole street. <br/><br/>Abi smiles at the sight of the cat, because she thinks cats are beautiful and affectionate. She\u2019s never thought of having a cat as a pet. Her mother doesn\u2019t like cats at all. She says that if Abi swallowed one single cat hair, it could harm her. It would be as if the hair travelled all the way down to her stomach, and then kittens would grow there and they would tickle her insides. <br/><br/>Then she would be unable to stop laughing, and then they would have to operate on her belly to get them out. What a disaster! <br/><br/>After watching the cat for a little while as it is strolling down the street, Abi gets ready for bed. She brushes her teeth, puts her pajamas on, climbs into bed and closes her eyes. <br/><br/>A few minutes later, she hears a cat\u2019s soft meow. A little scared, Abi opens her eyes and can\u2019t believe what she sees staring back at her. The small grey cat is on her windowsill. It\u2019s a beautiful cat, and one could even say it is a funny cat. <br/><br/>For some strange reason it\u2019s wearing a mask, as if it is some kind of superhero.<br/><br/>What should Abi do?<br/><br/>Ordinary people, book lovers, and writers from around the world are writing our books.
