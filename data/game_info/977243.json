Director Andr\u00e9 B\u00fccker's new virtual reality production transfers this emotional psychogram into a 360\u00b0 VR world. This offers an intense gaming experience in which Sch\u00f6nberg's music can be experienced in a completely new and immediate way.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen you put on the VR headset and pick up the controllers, you are immersed in a nocturnal, eerie forest in which a woman is searching for her lover. The player takes on the role of this woman, who wanders through the forest, and drives the plot forward through their own interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith \"Erwartung\", Staatstheater Augsburg is taking the next step in its digital theatre programme and linking artistic stage works and digital media even more closely.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T03:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c8d7480264b89ef05fb41f319d2c013.jpg", "website": "https://staatstheater-augsburg.de/vr_erwartung", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Staatstheater Augsburg", "Heimspiel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Staatstheater Augsburg"], "esrb_rating": null}
