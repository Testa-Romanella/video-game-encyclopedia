Like other cyber-based games, Uplink for example, I chose to have no real world routable IP addresses in the game.</p>\n<p>Some command functionality is also not exactly as expected. That is primarily due to time constraints and a quick 'How important is this to the game' check.</p>\n<p>If you notice anything really, really bad that I missed please let me know and I will see if I can add it in an update!</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>Color Palette: https://lospec.com/palette-list/1bit-monitor-glow</p>\n<p>Font: https://www.dafont.com/dogica.font</p>\n<p>Engine: Godot 3.4.4<br/></p>\n<p>All other assets created by me in Aseprite.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T09:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/391/3915a9cde6203636a6f7a5aa845c0005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chipper Deer Studio"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
