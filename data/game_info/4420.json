{"id": 4420, "slug": "closure", "name": "Closure", "name_original": "Closure", "description": "<p>This game is both a puzzle and a platformer. The plot and the gameplay are based on the game with light.<br />\nThe player plays like a little man, who is in almost total darkness. A spot of light snatches from the darkness a small part, in which the little man can move. The space for movement is limited by a spot of light, but sometimes outside of this spot or on the border of light and darkness it is possible to move quite freely - for example, even to pass through walls or fall through floors / ceilings. Sometimes it is not enough to be in a spot of light or in darkness for movement. The path is sometimes blocked by various obstacles, or this path simply needs to be found, it is necessary to understand how and where you can move - the goal of the game is to find the final exit.</p>\n<p>Among the puzzles are the search for various keys and ways to apply these keys, finding and moving light sources and other things. The game assumes that sooner or later the player will master the relationship with the light and will be able to use this understanding to achieve the ultimate goal.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2012-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-01T22:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/405/40567fe45e6074a5b2bfbd4a3fea7809.jpg", "website": "http://www.closuregame.com", "rating": 2.92, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 94, "owned": 1490, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 38, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 75, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Eyebrow Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Eyebrow Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
