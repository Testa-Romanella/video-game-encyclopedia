People are told to stay home, or risk succumbing to a deadly virus.</p>\n<p>You are the lead virologist, developing a vaccine, working remotely from home with a team of top scientists all over the world.<br/>Will you be able to balance your life, in complete isolation, as you work towards saving the world from this deadly virus?</p>\n<p>Welcome, to the Isolation Simulation.</p>\n\n<p>This project was built in about 40 hours, over the course of 3 days, for the Toronto Game Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>The theme for the project was \"Together But Apart\", which I took as\u00a0a not so subtle nod to the CoVID 19 pandemic, and the physical isolation that we're all implored to undertake. As such, I decided to double down on it, and try and make a simulation of our current situation, with the\u00a0twist of playing as a scientist working on developing a vaccine.</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by true life, but this scenario is a work of fiction. It is not meant to make light of the CoVID-19 pandemic. Stay safe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d164273dd23fc5e41164fc9a0b506ac4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["KovaKreative"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
