Then I started making a game about it and suddenly I felt a lot better.</p>\n<p>I decided this game would be <em>my first game</em>, but I was so lazy and did not know exactly what I wanted to do with it. I kept adding small features, but I never really sat down and decided what it was about, other than me in my apartment, feeling like shit and having nothing to do.</p>\n<p>So It's probably really boring.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f60da25111973f29294e1f75b590d233.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Molby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
