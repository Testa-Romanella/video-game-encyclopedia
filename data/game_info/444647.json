The answer is probably yes because the time erases memories from our head. Sometimes it is good to forget. Sometimes it is healthy.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>But not if you are the memory time wants to erase. In this game you have to do everything to not become forgotten!</p>\n<p>Everything takes place in a surreal environment where a clock is spawning time bombs. They are coming for you with one simple goal: to blow you up!</p>\n<p>Those bombs have some special abilities which turns them into a serious problem for you:</p>\n<ul><li>They can go through clock hands. So you can\u2019t hide behind them</li><li>They are immune against explosion damage</li><li>They are constantly spawning\u00a0</li><li>Their health increases with every level</li></ul>\n<p>Fortunately you can fight back. The Memory Is able to charge a shot. The longer you charge the more efficient the shot will be. Your bullet is also able to hit more than just one bomb. But with every bounce it will loose half of its power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also be aware of that you move slower while charging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But your attack has one downside. You have to think of the recoil!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls:</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow-Keys: Move</p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Fire (hold for charging)</p>\n<p>[ESC] / [P]: Pause</p>\n<p>The intro can become skipped with any key. But you first have to watch it once.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the gamedevtv-game-jam.
