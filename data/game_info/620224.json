So in one level only, I have try to include many small fun things like reversing gravity, teleportation, etc. It might be annoying but it will be fun overall ;-). Also, reversed gravity has a few glitches:(.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b7/3b7a27b3b8eaff32a827bbe0fb1167c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pushpendra"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
