{"id": 418327, "slug": "snow-blasters", "name": "Snow Blasters", "name_original": "Snow Blasters", "description": "<p>Build your fort from snow blocks, fight other penguins with snowballs, do structures, and much more!</p>\n<p>This game is a reimagination of what Snow Blasters could have been if rocket snail continued with the project. More information can be found in\u00a0https://rocketsnail.com/snowblasters/ But in short, before Club Penguin there was Experimental Penguins (a simple version of club penguin), and before all of that, rocket snail had an idea for a game that you build your fort, fight penguins with snowballs, and many more ideas I just couldn't put them all in the game. But in the end, it just transformed into Experimental Penguins, and later Club Penguin.</p>\n<p>Also istead of building this in Flash, i built it in Clickteam Fusion, and it's actually online. Huge thanks to the darkwire servers for hosting the server, i couldn't just do it myself.</p>\n<p>In case of any errors and stuff, try closing and opening the program various times. Also if your buttons are gray (you aren't connected) you are just too far away from the servers or you have a bad internet connection. Take in mind it's an indie project and I just can not fix all the bugs.</p>\n<p>Many of the game assets belong to rocket snail! So huge thanks to him!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/273/27336cc21b7b9f185debcc4a280bf125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Blue Hatted"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
