You have 4 buildings to choose from to make up the planet that most fits your agenda and achieve your goals in the limited time given!</p>\n\n<p>Godot Wild Jam #38 theme: Solarpunk</p>\n<p>Theme interpretations: So the first think when I heard of this was being eco-friendly and recycling. So about this topic I have heard a lot of people just randomly saying that everyone should just turn green without thinking about the funds or plan to do so. This is why I thought about combining solarpunk and the finances/profit when doing it. Although that said I don't know that much about finances and prices regarding this topic either.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:38:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c6/1c6fd70e90a219a72a85f95d2314c0c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["SpaghettiLord"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
