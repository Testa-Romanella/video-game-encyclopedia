It happens everywhere, at any possible time. We aim for a pause and then the world catches up. </p>\n<p>So we do something else and we miss a moment. This poem game has been made to encourage you to live a little bit more in the moment and to try not to miss what happens around you.</p>\n<p>Often the small things are the most precious ones.</p>\n<p>Often it's better to just enjoy what you're having instead of constantly plan for something that might never happen in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Take good care of yourself.</em></p>\n\n<p>Written and directed by Federico Fasce</p>\n<p>Music by Anne-Sophie Ouvrier</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Maddalena Grattarola and Marina Rossi</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why this price for the game?</strong></p>\n<p>The price as been set up as the cost of a nice (not luxurious) tea, or for a single trip on the London Underground. So I'll use the money from the game to look for inspiration while having tea or by randomly go around the city. This will eventually lead to more games!
