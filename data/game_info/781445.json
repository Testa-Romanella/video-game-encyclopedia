Do not open any folder as they will not play the game.</p><p>Controls: WASD to move and the left mouse button to fire.</p>\n<p>Note: The exit button does not work as that is intended for a Windows build. Also you will have to wait a couple seconds(roughly 5) until the leaderboard is enabled after you click the leaderboard button.</p>\n<p>Further note: Enter your name before starting the game or viewing the leaderboard as otherwise your name will be a long number. Enter the user name that you have used once while playing to view your score if you visit this page another time as names are not saved yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T18:46:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dca1a4ad78ed19674bd0b1d82e1c7621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreeZucchini"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
