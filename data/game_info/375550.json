All cards on bottom of pyramid are placed face up, while the others are placed face down. The last card after forming the pyramid is called the top card and is placed face up below the pyramid shape. The remaining cards are placed left of top card, all in one stack and face down.  <br/>The objective of the game is to clear all the cards forming the pyramid shape by matching the open cards to the top card. A match can be made when the open card value is one less or one more than the top card. When a match happens, it can be moved to the bottom as a top card, and the existing top card is discarded. If none can be matched, the card from the stack can be moved as the top card.   <br/>For detailed instructions on how to play, please click on the help button inside the game screen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T05:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d46656e82ef1c9b2e00659f27e5b2bc9_wkftuNR.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dinesh Rajan"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Dinesh Rajan"], "esrb_rating": null}
