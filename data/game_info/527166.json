He's very unpopular. He's just an ordinary boy seeking true love. But things suddenly start to change after a sudden turn of events. Suzuru followed a small crowd to Mayor Takahashi's 25th anniversary speech in the heart of Starlight City. Standing next to Takahashi-san is his daughter, Makoto Aizuru.

The next day, all is fine and swell. Until suddenly, and unexpectedly, came around a drunken man with a flamethrower, looking to seek revenge on the mayor for wronging him several years ago.
