While sometimes pretending your problems aren\u2019t there works, other times they come back and hit you harder than before. Perhaps it is better to face your problems. Acknowledging them is the first step to conquering them. This game attempts to make a commentary on that.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/982de445d9949a9107272e43aa4a1368.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ckjrckjr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
