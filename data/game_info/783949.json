{"id": 783949, "slug": "stormrise-itch", "name": "Stormrise (itch)", "name_original": "Stormrise (itch)", "description": "<p>The quaint fishing village of Stormrise is nestled into the mountainside. It is a peaceful, uneventful place where few people have reason to go. For many travelers it is just another stop on their journey. But for the villagers who call it their home, it is their life. Sheltered and cut off from most civilization, they live off the land and sea.</p>\n<p>Though the villagers are attuned with the nature around them, they are still at its mercy. Storms from the sea pass through all the time, but nothing like the most recent hurricane that blew through the cliffside. High winds damaged buildings and bridges, and fish are hard to find after the waters were disturbed.</p>\n<p>As a traveling shaman, it is your calling to help those in need. To pass through the village without offering assistance would be against your moral code. Perhaps after the villagers have been aided, they will be able to offer you something beneficial in return, such as safe passage across the ocean on one of their boats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T07:59:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/99276d07daef2f15074d212128ba3fd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Fore"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
