{"id": 338739, "slug": "one-way-mines", "name": "One way mines!", "name_original": "One way mines!", "description": "<p><strong>One way mines!</strong>, is a runner-obstacle game, where, with the press of one single button, the player must control the direction in which the character moves, having to think quickly, for there are mines all around you and you can only change 90 degrees the direction in a clockwise motion on each input, and all these, without stop moving forward.</p>\n<p>Two players can play the multiplayer mode. with the same mechanics, but this time, each player has one specific button to press, and they must do it while alternating each input.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>: press space bar at the beginning of each mode to start.</p>\n<p><strong>single player</strong>: press space bar to change the direction 90 degrees on a clockwise motion</p>\n<p><strong>multiplayer</strong>: player 1 uses the space bar to change the direction, player 2 uses the 'A' on the keyboard. after one player uses his input, said input is deactivated until the other player presses his key.</p>\n<p><strong>Overral developver and programmer</strong>: Me! <strong>Adrian Garcia Hernandez.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is a project for the Amazin berlin 2020 contest, in the category of Human Human Machine Award, the reason being the capability of playing an exciting and funny game of cooperation in pairs, while still using one button.</strong></p>\n<p>The overall theme of the game is the limitation of the movement, not caused by the obstacles, but by the own players. In games consisting of avoiding obstacles, in general, the player has almost all the control of the movement. This project wants to explore how much of the control is lost due to the players not coordinating, in a nutshell; how the difficulty changes if we add a second player with the same mechanics, controlling both the same character.</p>\n<p>Finally, my future compromise with this project for the contest of the AMAZE berlin 2020 are the following things:</p>\n<p><strong>-add more maps and routes to make a more challenging game<br/>-add the option to customize the maps, speed, buttons, and character, to give the players a more fulfilling game.<br/>-improve the quality of the environment and art.<br/>-polish the game in the scenario of programming, adding more obstacles, enemies, environmental hazards...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for passing by!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:06:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e83f1e8640e98bf6b25b9c2cc5e94c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Naeus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
