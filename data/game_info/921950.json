All traces of human life on Earth have been eradicated.</p>\n<p>Among all the different creatures that have risen from the ashes of humanity, the\u00a0Rabbit\u00a0has become one of\u00a0the few dominant species that has flourished more than the rest.<br/></p>\n<p>However, their harsh nemesis, the Badger,\u00a0has not been so lucky, as the\u00a0sites they reside in\u00a0have been fuming with radioactive waste, which has had many drastic\u00a0side effects for them.</p>\n<p>Whilst we\u2019ve had sufficient power to sustain our district for the past century, we have been unable to comply with\u00a0the record-breaking\u00a0rise of our\u00a0population. As a temporary solution, your job will be to scavenge the creatures\u2019\u00a0spawning grounds to collect any and all radioactive energy to help fuel our progress.</p>\n<p>You, a RabbInk, are a rare breed of Rabbit that has\u00a0the natural ability to produce ink at will due to an odd mutation your ancestors have been exposed to, which is conveniently the weakness of your target. Plus, the mutation\u00a0has also\u00a0given\u00a0natural immunity to most forms of radiation, so we won\u2019t lose many ressources when sending you there.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like you have a choice, after all. You\u2019ve volunteered\u00a0to do community service duty in exchange of freedom, so this is your only choice if you\u2019d like to pay back your crimes.</p>\n<p>wish you the best of luck\u2026 not.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Goal</em></strong></p>\n<p>Survive as long as possible and collect as much radioactive waste in between waves. They will help you upgrade your weapon to survive longer.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong></p>\n<p>A and D\u00a0- Moving left and right</p>\n<p>S - Swim/Submerge in ink</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Press: Shoot / Hold: Charge</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Throw Bomb</p>\n<p>Middle Mouse Button - Activate Special</p>\n<p>TAB - Switch weapon <br/></p><p><strong><em>Weapons and Specials</em></strong></p><p>Rain-Bow : rainbow cloud that pours ink onto the battle field</p><p>Maws-Mower : Shred through hordes of creatures <br/></p><p>Cat Control - Pin down a portion of the map to prevent enemies from approaching you</p><p>Shooter - Regular automatic shooter</p><p>Charger - Charge your weapon for a massive shot</p><p>Minigun - Charge your weapon to keep shooting for a significant amount of time</p><p>Shotgun - Single Shot weapon that deals devasting damage<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab0/ab07e768f37568c33cad86ca067f3885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GenyaDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
