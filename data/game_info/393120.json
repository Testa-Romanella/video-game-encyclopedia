You could just as easily copy and paste the 20 lines of code into a new project and have it run perfectly. Though the default font and lack of sounds makes it less enjoyable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To do this you just need to create a new project, add an object called 'obj' and paste the 20 lines into the draw event. I\u00a0did notice that having such dense code like this makes the editor run slowly so be warned.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to add sounds / fonts just create the resources and set them to whatever you want, though the names of the resources must be the same:</p>\n<p>bg_music,\u00a0snd_hit,\u00a0snd_shoot,\u00a0snd_die</p>\n<p>fnt_main, fnt_about</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T07:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/441898ba8a86bfe98a0160b6ff1e95c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CloseRange"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
