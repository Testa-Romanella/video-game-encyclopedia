Armed with a single torch, Palokoma must venture into the dark, spike-ridden Tube Cave to save her Palokomettes, who wandered inside while she was sleeping! Here you'll find semi-hard areas, torch-dampening water &amp; blind cave lizards who talk.</p>\n<p>Higo Bloiko was made in Godot for the Optical Game Jam #4 over on itch.io, where we had to make a game based on a given picture (see below) within a single week.</p>\n<p>The name comes from a random line in the sound poem \"Karawane\" by Hugo Ball, back when I had no idea where I was going with this project, and because I have trouble naming things. \"Palokoma\" is a completely made up word.</p>\n<p>Working on this project made me confront some gaps in my understanding of the Godot engine, which is why it's a bit rough around the edges. Though it's not as well written as I hoped it'd be, I'm glad that I got to learn some more things about Godot.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n\n\n<p>#################################################################################</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Left &amp; right arrow keys to walk.<br/>Up arrow key to jump.
