The factory produced cakes and pastries, sweets and truffles. However, the rabbit mafia always looked at the factory with disdain. Chocolate was a significant competition for carrots. Rabbits didn't like it. They decided to take over the factory and start producing carrot pies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow you have to defend the interests of the chocolate factory. Watch out for production, prevent drunk Dwarves from the conveyor, repel attacks of the rabbit mafia and load firewood in time. Chocolate is not to blame - it is simply delicious!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e013d87540fbf2579e41f763be9d2089.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anatoliy Loginovskikh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zotdinex"], "esrb_rating": null}
