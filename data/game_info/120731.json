Puzzles vary from level to level, but are fun all the same! This game was created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 30. Special thanks to ScampTG and Danielh90 for giving feedback! The game is free now, and will always be free, but donations are appreciated! I am currently working on adding external level support, so there could be a place to download and upload levels you have created! More news on that when it is fully functional.</p><p>Update:</p><p>Portals fixed, added new levels</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6081e4d6dc72df92f63c8a56f3e63413.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gandalf1209"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
