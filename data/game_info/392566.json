Doing so requires careful use of Splotches, the colorful dots within the maze that change Blub's color on contact. When Blub has become a certain color, he has the ability to\u00a0pass through walls of that color. Enjoy this small game prototype!</p>\n<p>Splotches started out as a pencil and paper game that Evan Charfauros drew for his friends on the elementary school playground circa 2009. Eight years later\u00a0as a high school senior, Evan revived his childhood idea and traded colored pencils for code--here is the result.</p>\n<p>Developed by James Hua, Shibangi Pal, and Jason Lee, with Evan Charfauros as lead coder and designer. Submitted as our\u00a0final project\u00a0for Tammy Neuhaus's AP Computer Science class and voted best in the class, 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T05:26:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc3a201a52282c1dba30627bf20b0d06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan Charfauros"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
