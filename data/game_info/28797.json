Download the manual for this game by locating the game on http://marketplace.xbox.com and selecting \u201cSee Game Manual&quot;. Matt Hazard was once the ultimate video game action hero delighting millions of fans during the 80s and 90s with his bloody and violent games. However, in the last few years of the console cycle, he\u2019s fallen on hard times and has yet to star in a next-gen game.  When he finally gets the call he\u2019s been waiting for to make his official comeback, he finds out he\u2019s not the star,  but the prey. Matt must defeat the game where the programmers aren\u2019t playing by the rules. They\u2019re throwing everything at him in their arsenal from old enemies, to past environments, unfair weapons, and more to make sure he doesn\u2019t make it to the last level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-13T02:37:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03b/03bdd545863eba7e8ade5d51b6ba6d76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.83, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 196, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 80, "ratings_count": 22, "suggestions_count": 685, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 23, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Vicious Cycle Software"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
