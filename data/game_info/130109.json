Yes, the band as in Wonderwall and stuff. Our task was to pick a song title and use that as our theme. We chose Fuckin' in the Bushes which resulted is Bang Buster, a game where you play a security guard patrolling a park and is tasked with cracking down on public fornication. Avoid obstacles! Grab donut power-ups from seagulls! Smash the hearts and type out what's indicated to complete your tasks! Last two minutes to finish your shift and go into overtime for maximum points!
