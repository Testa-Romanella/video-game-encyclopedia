Slowly you recognize it&#39;s pattern as Morse code. Transfixed you watch the light, and maybe respond yourself...<br />\nControls:<br />\nWhen seeing a message, it will loop until you press Enter. Short blinks are dots and long blinks are dashes. Here is the Morse Alphabet for reference, it&#39;s also in the pdf.<br />\nWhen you press Enter you can send a message by sending a blinking Morse message back by pressing spacebar, holding it a brief time for a dot and a longer time for a dash. Press Enter again when your message is finished. The Entity will likely only respond to simple words such as &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Who,&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; or &quot;Sorry.&quot; Sometimes the Entity may not acknowledge your response at all. You can also choose not to respond, just press Enter without sending any light flashes.<br />\nIf the messages are coming too fast or slow you can adjust the speed of the game with the up and down arrows. If you want to hear a tone when the light flashes on, press &quot;m&quot; to unmute, or mute again if you change your mind.<br />\nIf the blinking light is too high contrast, you can press 2 or 3 to change to a less intense color palette. It&#39;ll update the next time the light flashes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-01T13:01:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebbf87e5788b26b16880c66d4dab19d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boomboombap"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
