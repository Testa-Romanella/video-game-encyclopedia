Use your dolphin echolocation to find your way back to her.<br/><br/>Sea creatures will respond to your calls and if you approach them they will give you a hint about which direction to search for Mama. But beware, not all of them will tell you the truth...<br/><br/>This game was created in 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2021. Some additional time was spent bug-fixing and polishing the graphics, but no major changes were made to the gameplay. This game is quite short and should take only a couple minutes to complete. We hope you like it!</p>\n\n<p>Control the dolphin with the arrow keys. Click the mouse button or press spacebar to use your echolocation. Use the escape key to end the game early.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T09:51:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ad/9adb3966d2300d232147f29d5379923e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Josiah Purtlebaugh", "Cerenios", "TaigaIwashita", "tonicodrea"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
