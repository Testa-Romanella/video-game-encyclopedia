{"id": 975855, "slug": "deep-scanner", "name": "Deep Scanner", "name_original": "Deep Scanner", "description": "Welcome to the BAORA9 production facility! Your goal is to <strong>collect items</strong> extracted from the facility and deliver them to <strong>reach the required quota</strong> for leaving the structure. Beware of the \"local creatures,\" <strong>monsters that will raid the facility</strong> through the ventilation ducts during your work sessions. Each level features a different creature, <strong>each requiring a unique approach to survive</strong>. Use a <strong>limited battery scanner</strong> to detect monsters, managing it wisely to avoid being defenseless.<br/><br/>The facility is divided into three rings. You can close the doors of various zones to protect yourself and block local creatures during the game. Keep track of the number of managed zones, as losing too many will slow down item production, making it harder to reach the quota to abandon the structure.<br/><br/>Your survival depends on your intuition, wit, and skills. Can you find the right strategy, manage resources intelligently, and leave the BAORA9 production facility unscathed?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T05:47:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/95701ea40a45dde948a00d0738e11bb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seven Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Seven Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
