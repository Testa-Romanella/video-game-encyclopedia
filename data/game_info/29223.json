Every decision is important, be it the jobs you take, the friends you make, or the cards you collect. Death comes quickly, but each play offers new situations and strategies to explore.</p>\n<p>Play as Sal, Rook, or Smith. Three unique character campaigns with their own specialized decks, abilities and maps to explore. Sal is an adventurer out for profit and revenge. Rook is an aging spy working his own agenda. Smith is an idle loafer who might just save the world. Each playable character&#39;s story takes place in a unique environment, with different factions and locations to explore and exploit.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-21T06:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/81b/81bf6b3cb4851f135b90091ec8ac5445.jpg", "website": "http://www.griftlands.com", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 32, "owned": 549, "beaten": 32, "toplay": 67, "dropped": 39, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 68, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
