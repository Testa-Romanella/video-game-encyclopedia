It starts off easy and then gets harder and then easier and then....you get the point, the difficulty level varies as the game is played longer. The game is coded in python and took a long time to make so hope you enjoy playing it. There might be bugs and if there are make sure to leave a comment below, BTW every time you close the game it shows a random error, just close it and go on with what you were doing. Hope You Enjoy:)&lt;3</p>\n<p>PS: You should not make it fullscreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/3436fbdc8e457f3f48d04b44d0695f53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmIaJoKeToYou"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
