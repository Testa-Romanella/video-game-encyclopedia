Built by a three-person team in three weeks; I did all of the dialog, and coded the system to run it. It's possible on certain screens for the game to become unresponsive-- that's a bug outside of areas I worked on. I may attempt to fix it at some point, but the intro is playable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eac994d46a5f2c673ed61d7b00c962d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["crowcas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
