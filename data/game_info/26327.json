This collection of \n      games was available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a \n      game and a clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: \n      GAME A (one player) and GAME B (two players). While some controls have \n      been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi \n      system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      You have a split second to decide: whack your opponent, or duck out of \n      the way?
