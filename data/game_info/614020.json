It's still in development, so it's not finished yet. The hardest part of creating this game for me was coming up with the idea and adding the graphics. I am a programmer, so graphics issues are very difficult for me to solve. The price of the game is free, the best help you can do is to help create the graphics and fix bugs. Right now the bugs I found are: I use photon and for some reason it doesn't transfer data between players very fast, sometimes player can jump very high, map is not finished, optimization is needed,\u00a0 no sounds</p>\n<p><strong>The code of the game is on my github.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T05:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc2/dc2a7f30df9f02e2151606392bdc2dca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["sti11er"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
