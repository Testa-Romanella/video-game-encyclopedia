Santa's tracking who is naughty and nice - good boys and girls get gifts, bad boys and girls get coal, and absolutely rotten children get a code brown from Santa's downtown. Too EXTREME for Apple, too OFFENSIVE for your children, too HARDCORE for your FACE! Player's take control of Santa's sleigh - complete with twelve tiny, exploding reindeer - to help him travel city to city to perform his Christmas Eve deliveries. At the end of each city exists a single house - one with someone just so rotten, that Santa has to pop a squat on their chimney and squeeze out a growler. Why call Santa when you can jump in the sleigh and get to work? Now that's what I'm talking about!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee62cfd4a66ad842141cb106eb47e07.jpg", "website": "http://www.ceruleangames.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=154", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Drunk Robot Games", "Effinvance"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cerulean Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
