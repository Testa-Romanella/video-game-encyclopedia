When build the deck, player has a few choices. They can only add 6 cards from all the Rank 1 cards. But in the game, player can Rank Up units. Cards can developed into different High Rank Cards by combining with other cards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is very flexible. Player can choose different tactics based on situation, so they aren't determining before game actual start but in game. So player can avoid things like [No key cards], [Have worse deck], and [Have useless cards]</p>\n<p>However, this is just Demo version. Features are not completed. This is minimum viable play only.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is built with Unity (Version 2019.1.10) . The platform is Unity PC, Mac, Linux\u00a0standalone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently, there's only 20 cards and simple AI. My simple and crude vector drawing. Background, sound effect, and particle effects are free asset from Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>Since, I am Chinese, this game support Simplify Chinese as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Network is not supported and there's no BGM.</p>\n<p>This project\u00a0is meant to show the game play and my abilities. It's free and open source.
