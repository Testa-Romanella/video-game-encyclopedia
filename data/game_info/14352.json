{"id": 14352, "slug": "bionic-dues", "name": "Bionic Dues", "name_original": "Bionic Dues", "description": "<p>Bionic Dues is a futuristic game where you have to prepare your defenses before the rise of the machines.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set somewhere in the future, just a few weeks before a robots&#39; rebellion. Rogue machines are about to wipe out a city of 12 million people. The defenders have only 50 days left to prepare before the final battle begins. The protagonist is a pilot who drives Exos, the game&#39;s equivalent of mechas.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls a group of four Exos. Their movements and attacks are turn-based. During the 50-days period, the player has to gather details and HPs to upgrade his or her Exos, explore the map, prepare defenses, and set traps. On the final day, the player&#39;s preparations will be tested by the enemy invasion. Preparation is everything in this game. Stealth and tactical use of the environment are also important since Exos often cannot withstand against a horde of enemies in an open battle.</p>\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n<p>Like many roguelike games, Bionic Dues is unforgiving. It uses trial and error gameplay model so that the player usually has to fail many times before he or she can succeed. However, there are six difficulty levels that make it more tolerable for less experienced players.</p>\n<h3>Visual style</h3>\n<p>Bionic Dues&#39; visuals are minimalistic, cold and &quot;robotic&quot;, complete with &quot;mechanical&quot; voices and high-tech unit design. It presents the player with a top-down view of the map that looks almost like a circuit board.</p>", "metacritic": 71, "released": "2013-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e552b9e7c1ab540fd4dff175e1590e9_sgvReqK.jpg", "website": "http://arcengames.com/bionic-dues/", "rating": 1.95, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 74, "owned": 1395, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 20}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 220, "ratings_count": 56, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 57, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arcen Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Arcen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
