This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1.</p>\n<p>The theme was <strong>It's not real</strong>, so naturally, I made a game based on minesweeper combined with turn-based battling with vegetable snail hybrids. As I said, naturally.</p>\n<p>The story of the\u00a0game is that your garden is infested wit vegetable snail hybrids (it makes more\u00a0sense in-game). Some of your crops are<strong> real</strong>, and some of them are <strong>not real</strong>. The game is played like\u00a0minesweeper but the mines are\u00a0the vegetable snail hybrids,\u00a0every time you find a one of this critters,\u00a0you battle with it. Precise Instructions are In-Game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move. \"C\" Key to attack a real vegetable or a snail and \"V\" to pick up a real vegetable or a snail. Use the mouse to press the buttons in the menu and in battle.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD ans Arrow Key support</p>\n<p>4 orgininal snails to fight</p>\n<p>2 music tracks made by Heatley Bros</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Pixellari (Font font used in this game) was</p>\n<p>\u00a0made by Zacchary Dempsey-Plante.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Music: \"8 Bit Play\" By HeatleyBros</p>\n<p>CLICK HERE</p>\n<p>\u2022 Music: \"Quirkii\" By HeatleyBros\u00a0</p>\n<p>CLICK HERE</p>\n<p>\u2022 Base of the battle system made by Brackeys\u00a0</p>\n<p>(asset downloadable in the description).</p>\n<p>\u2022 Credit for my playtesters for playtesting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc482ade3fcd3ae9c07085338e5024b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RKI3000"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
