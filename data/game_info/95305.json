The direction of the screens is randomly selected in real time, you can see this on a snake-like minimap in the top right corner.<br/></p>\n<p>This was my first game jam ever and I roughly spent 3 days in total working on it. I wanted to code the engine myself so I didn't have enough time to implement everything. However I was pretty happy to submit the playable MVP, thanks to my wife who helped me with the pixel art.</p>\n<p>Press enter to start and arrows to move.<br/></p>\n<p>Check the source code here: https://github.com/w0rm/elm-mogee<br/></p>\n<p> I will definitely continue working on the game.
