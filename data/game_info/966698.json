It takes place in a dark fantasy world plagued with rotten and evil angels (visually inspired by biblically accurate angels) and possesed people who have invaded the castle of our protagonist. Our protagonist fights in a series of consecutives arenas, each one with multiple waves featuring different enemies, until he reaches the throne and overcomes the invasion. Failure means starting again from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is fast paced and movility is key, giving importance to dashes, dodges, jumps (and double jumps) and well timing attacks from the attack toolset the player has available. The player also has access to limited powers useful for combat. Each attack or action is suitable for a particular situation or enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe final wave of each arena presents a new angel as a final boss to put the player's skills to test and overcome the arena, being able to advance to the next one.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T04:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae6a59336119d759b39940c595348de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dream Slash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Dream Slash"], "esrb_rating": null}
