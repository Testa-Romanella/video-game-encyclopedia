{"id": 979583, "slug": "perfect-poses", "name": "Perfect Poses", "name_original": "Perfect Poses", "description": "<h3>AGILITY DETERMINES FLEXIBILITY</h3>A board is moving towards you, but there is a hole. The only way to stay on the platform is to go through the hole. Adjust your pose that fit the hole within a limited time frame and go through it. The ultimate target is to go through all 100 holes and climb up to the very top of the tower.<br/><h3>POSING MODE</h3>You're free to move all the bone controllers in posing mode, so that your character can be transformed to any shape. If you're a challenger, you may use the perspective projection mode. If it is too hard for you, the orthographic projection mode may help. You may also change the speed of the moving board, which will directly affect the difficulty of the level.<br/><h3>PUSH AND FALL</h3>You will be pushed by the moving board and fall if you can't go through the hole.<br/><h3>FALLING CONTROL</h3>Try your best to control your character and land on the platform during falling so you don't need to restart from the very beginning.<br/><h3>STRETCH OUT YOUR LIMBS</h3>Of course, tuck in your limbs can make things easier, but you may fail the level easier as well. The more you stretch out your limbs, the higher score you will obtain.<br/><br/><br/>Good luck, body challengers!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T07:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c67/c6789398a3830965a9e11e8544c1ea8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuantumTechno Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QuantumTechno Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
