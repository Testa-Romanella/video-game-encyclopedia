Unfortunately I was only able to spend a few days on the project. I dedicated a lot of time to the visuals of the game which I am very proud of, however this prevented me from being able to implement all the mechanics I wanted. I also feel that my code architecture could be vastly improved. Sorry for there only being 2 levels.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:02:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a23be1cd4cd532f6a1f860b00b1d4e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JoshuaGeorge"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
