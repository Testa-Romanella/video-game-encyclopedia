Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Become a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this 20-40 hour game, you'll:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Combine cards to tell your own story in a rich, Lovecraftian world of ambition, appetite and abomination.</strong>\u00a0Corrupt your friends. Consume your enemies. There is never only one history.</li><li><strong>Found a cult, dedicated to the Red Grail, or the Witch-and-Sister, or the Forge of Days.</strong>\u00a0Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat's-paws. Use your disciples to keep you fed - or feed on your disciples.</li><li><strong>Unravel arcane, unacknowledged mysteries.</strong>\u00a0Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Locate and pillage the Star Shattered Fane. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus.</li><li><strong>Outwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities.</strong>\u00a0Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped.</li><li><strong>Transcend death with a story-driven legacy system.</strong>\u00a0Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they'll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they'll bring the Dawn.</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Won:\u00a0</strong>Best Game Design,\u00a0Emotional\u00a0Games Awards 2018</p>\n<p><strong>Awaiting decision:\u00a0</strong>Best\u00a0Game, BIG Festival 2018 + Best Gameplay, BIG Festival 2018 + Innovation, BIG Festival 2018 + Innovation in Art &amp; Narrative, Boston FIG 2018</p>\n\n<p>\u263d\u2605\u263e\r\n</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Twitter:\u00a0</strong>@factoryweather,\u00a0@alexiskennedy,\u00a0@tronbevan</li><li><strong>Steam forums:\u00a0</strong>here!</li><li><strong>Discord:\u00a0</strong>channel here,\u00a0invite link here</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd00102edfb702c3bb2fc10282a018ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alexis Kennedy"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
