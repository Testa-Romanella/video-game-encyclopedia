Unlike the original and Crusader, Kingdoms allows players to relive the Middle Ages in the world\u2019s first castle MMO. A cross-platform strategy game, Kingdoms invites mobile and desktop players to battle together online by thrusting the Middle Ages and famous Stronghold characters into a persistent MMO world. Besiege the castle that\u2019s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction\u2019s war effort, pillage your neighbour\u2019s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all!<br/><br/>Only by engaging enemy troops, taking back villages from The Wolf and winning votes in the political arena can players hope to succeed. Stronghold Kingdoms is set in a fast-paced, challenging game world designed for large numbers of players working together in pursuit of a common goal.<br/><br/>..::: COMMUNITY :::..<br/><br/>Facebook \u2013 http://www.facebook.com/StrongholdKingdoms <br/>Twitter \u2013 http://www.twitter.com/PlayStronghold <br/>YouTube \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/fireflyworlds <br/>Support \u2013 http://support.strongholdkingdoms.com <br/><br/>..::: MESSAGE FROM FIREFLY :::..<br/><br/>We designed Stronghold Kingdoms to be the first fully fledged PvP (player versus player) strategy MMO RTS for mobile devices.
