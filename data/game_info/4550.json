{"id": 4550, "slug": "dead-space-2", "name": "Dead Space 2", "name_original": "Dead Space 2", "description": "<p>Dead Space 2 is a third-person action shooter including both survival and horror elements. The game is a direct sequel to the first chapter of the Dead Space franchise. The game is set in the space environment of the future. The story of the second part begins in 2511, 3 years after the events held in the first game. The main character Isaac Clarke is awakened after 3-year coma (after the escape from Aegis VII) in an insane asylum in the Sprawl on Titan. A soon as the event pace raises and antagonists start pursuing him to get his brains (for building a new Marker), Isaac realizes his only goal \u2013 the destruction of the Marker. Players are offered to join the protagonist\u2019s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear \u2013 special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2011-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T07:17:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ae1/ae1518c3dc1e847344661905fd2a8d16.jpg", "website": "http://deadspace.ea.com/", "rating": 4.37, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 390, "owned": 4214, "beaten": 1421, "toplay": 189, "dropped": 199, "playing": 28}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 99, "ratings_count": 1339, "suggestions_count": 661, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1347, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Visceral Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
