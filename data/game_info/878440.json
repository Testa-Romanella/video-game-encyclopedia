You play as <strong>Brat</strong>, the little league baseball player\u00a0that was transported to some other dimension with strange worlds and baddies. You're just trying to survive by jumping, avoiding obstacles,\u00a0and sometimes using a baseball bat for good measure.</p>\n<p><strong>Each level in B3 has 3 objectives that will award 1 star:</strong></p>\r\n\u00a0Find the exit.\u00a0<strong>This is all that is required to unlock the next level.</strong>Collect the 8 <strong>Coins</strong> located somewhere in each level<br/><br/>Find the <strong>Key </strong>and open the <strong>Treasure Chest</strong>\u00a0in each level\r\n<p>To collect 3 stars and therefore 100% complete a level, <strong>you must do so in a single run</strong>.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You have 2 extra lives, and dying doesn't count against you for getting 3 stars. Just don't die that 3rd time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are some additional tips to help you succeed in B3:</strong><br/></p>\r\nIf a level contains a <strong>Checkpoint,\u00a0</strong>you will gain an extra life and respawn from this point if you die.<br/><br/><br/>Hit a <strong>Powerup </strong>block if available to obtain a special power that lasts the entire level.<br/>Throw a <strong>Baseball </strong>to do some damage to enemies.<br/>The <strong>Baseball Bat</strong> is a beast. It can kill most enemies in one swing, break some boxes, and even allow you to hover momentarily!<br/><strong>Slimes </strong>are slow and weak. But, they can walk over small gaps.<strong>Skeletons </strong>are tough and run fast. But, nothing a Baseball Bat can't take care of.<br/>Bats are tough and can fly.\u00a0 Watch out for them in high places.<br/>Ghosts can't be killed. (Because they're already dead, right?) They will chase you if you come near them. Just run away and they will give up the chase.\r\n\n<p><em>B3 contains 20 levels spread over two worlds (Rookie World and Spooky World). But I plan on adding more levels in the future, especially if there is demand for it.\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T08:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678a033ac3f744ad66a95b82d7d02fe5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jongjungbu"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
