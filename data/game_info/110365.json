After some time I had the idea of creating a simple RPG Maker game about animals, and I decided to go for MV for the android portability.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA Hamster in the Forest\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou will play as a hamster, named Eldamar, and you appear in a beautiful forest. Explore the different areas and talk to the other animals! You will see foxes, rabbits, stags, squirrels, ducks, and a horse that will request your help, among more! You will have to help the horse to talk with the Being of the Area, a strange and very wise thing...\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMinigames and combat!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOnce you get access to the big buildings you will unlock two minigames, a simple labyrinth and a labyrinth of obstacles. They both are repeteable and are made to award you with leaves, the currency of this game. You need leaves to unlock more characters (see below in Characters and Classes). Other modality to earn leaves is by combats, but you will need more powerful skills to defeat the enemies! The combat arenas are also repeteables and give you many more leaves!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCharacters and Classes\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can use leaves to buy Apples and Water, that will recover your health and power respectively. But leaves can also be used for other purpose: to unlock more playable animals! The animals are found in the House of the Being. The animals are divided into two classes and one special class. Each class has its own arena (they are basically the same but I wanted to make this distinction), and the special class can enter anywhere. The more expensive the character is, the more powerful is.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPacific Animals: they are Eldamar the Hamster, Harley the Rabbit, Daffy the Duck, Lobelia the Toad and Ovis the Sheep!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAggressive Animals: they are Mellivoro the Badger, Amaltea the Goat, Pumba the Boar, Pooh the Bear and Blackhen the Rooster!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tOmnipotent Animal: it is Tanuki the Conqueror, a special class that is overpowered and invincible.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe Room of Pets\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn the House of the Being there is a room with many doors. It is a memorial for my pets, that will update each time a pet I have dies. For now you can only access to the first door, the door of Eldamar the Hamster. I don't know how many pets I can have over all my life, but if I end having more animals than doors, I can always ampliate that room.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCredits\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCandacis, Granny, Sevarihk, Roxy Gray, Biggislims, Fayforest.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSpecial thanks to Raquel Salas, who worked hard for many of the faces of the animals in dialogs and also made the fantastic artwork for the cover \u2665</p><p>\n<strong>Buy the Soundtrack</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/addee18b68fd25f94d36f4efe0047aef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fegefeueranilmathiel"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
