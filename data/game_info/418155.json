Nowadays, many traders board the subway every day to travel across the urban area, buying low and selling high, to make ends meet. You need to pay your debt today: can you multiply your investment simply by toying with supply and demand?</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get a certain amount of money before the time runs out. Keep an eye on the timetable to take the most efficient routes between the low-sellers and high-buyers. Stock is limited, so you'll need to explore the entire city. And who knows: maybe you'll find good deals near the edge of town.<br/></p>\n<p>Play with the mouse, other controls explained in-game, but here are some I forgot to mention:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Right click: Place a pin (use them as reminders!)</li><li>M: Toggle Music</li><li>F4+F5: Restart game instantaneously</li><li>F11: Toggle Fullscreen</li></ul>\n<p>To learn how to play, check out all the tooltips in-game! There are also some cheats: hold the right mouse button on top of the game title text (in the bottom left corner of the window) to use them.</p>\n<p>Made in seven days for #7drl.
