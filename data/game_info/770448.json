You have to save the Lightbulb prince who is absolutely lame. If you have any questions ask yourself: isn't a magic space loop the solution to all of your problems? If not, ask youself again. Also the prince is not the only one who is lame. The whole premise of saving this loser implies I have no idea how to write a good story. Also there is no prince. Anyways, you travel through realms using realm portals. Each realm has a loop radius that you can harvest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b2a2a2f8fdb46d76964ae25e31014d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AdamSzentesi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
