Live with your mistakes, a moment is final.</p>\n<p>Made for a 5 day jam where the theme was \"reflection\" (both literal and figurative).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9c9fd88a231b9ba73d27dc1ac5bde45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cotu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
