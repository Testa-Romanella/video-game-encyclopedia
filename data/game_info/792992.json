By many I mean none! Literally none. You click a button and that's it. Whatever. If you ignore that, then it surely can be a good game, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gameplay is quite straight forward. You are bored. You play this garbage. You click the button. And the boredom increases. This game is a wonderful tool to show your friends how insanely bored you are. If you are incredibly bored, then the number is most likely going to be very high. If you are not very bored, the number will probably be low.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game was created as an experiment for me to try to learn how to make UI because this was not actually my first game to start making on Unity so stay tuned for that!</p>\n<p>Now go be bored!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T17:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6089e867dabc63fb89b59b4c93d4da95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["TheHolyBred"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
