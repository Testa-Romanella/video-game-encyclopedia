They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!<br />\nWhat could go wrong?<br />\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you&#39;ve been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.<br />\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.</p>", "metacritic": 62, "released": "2014-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T14:32:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d158c70eb8835a26a64509d29f42cc8d.jpeg", "website": "http://www.scottgames.com/", "rating": 3.6, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 565, "beaten": 138, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 46, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 155, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 155, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "iOS", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "Android"], "developers": ["Scott Cawthon"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Scott Cawthon", "CLICKTEAM L.L.C."], "esrb_rating": null}
