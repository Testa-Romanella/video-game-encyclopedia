Put the correct hand into the orb to light it up! Listen to the music and when the ring touches that orb, click that trigger!</p>\n<p>Is that a path coming from the orb? That's a freeze orb! Click  and hold while keeping that orb lit. Follow through until the end!</p>\n<p>Scoring is based on how well you timed the click to the beat of the music. Orbs will leave behind a coloured spark that shows if you clicked too late, too early or perfectly to the beat! For freeze orbs, scoring is based on the percentage of the freeze that you successfully clicked and held. Bright white sparks are where it's at! Yellow sparks are okay too I guess...</p>\n<p>All rhythm games have one golden rule:\u00a0<strong>Keep that life bar up!</strong> Missing orbs = missing life. If the bar empties, that's <em>game over</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Rhythm Click requires SteamVR and has been successfully tested on both the Vive and Index so far. I hope to get it working on other headsets and I will update accordingly!</p>\n\n<p>Join the<strong> Rhythm Click Discord</strong>!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Custom mapping is available but requires some manual tweaking to start and also to get the map to flow well. \"Mapping mode\" instructions will be outlined in the discord.<br/></p>\n<p>Many other features are still planned or in development so stay tuned!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b06/b06eaa40f9f90e97d62e7e95b6a66c6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sopocode"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
