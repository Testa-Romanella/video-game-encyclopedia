Yes you can touch them.\r\n<p>Ever need to pull a character from nowhere in your game, your novel, your fanfic, your LARP, your whatever? We\u2019ve got you covered.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>In this book, you\u2019ll find 100 people that your characters or someone else might hook up with in an urban fantasy story. We\u2019re talking vampires, werewolves, merfolk, demons, cat boys, spirits, fairies, and all sorts of other weirdness. Each of these 100 characters features:\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>A name</strong>. Some are kinda common names, some are a little weirder in hopes of sparking your imagination!\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>A profile pic</strong>. A picture we threw together to help communicate who that person is, and to maybe shake up some expectations about what kinds of people do what.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>A description</strong>. Who they are and what they do. More importantly, we talk about how they might be romantically involved with your story.\r\n </p>\n<p>We top all this off with some room for notes, so you can jot down game traits, ideas for how to tie them into your story, relationships characters build with them, or whatever strikes your fancy!\r\n </p>\n<p>We think this is the perfect tool for novelists, TV writers, game masters, and anyone who just needs a little nudge to get those creative juices going.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T07:08:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c333c063d2f911cc6111d8b9dbd36b60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Machine Age Productions"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
