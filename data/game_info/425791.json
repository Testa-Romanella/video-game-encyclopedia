Once in a while (spoilers: after every 5 mushrooms) imps will appear. Touching an imp will make you lose a salamander (it probably ran away from danger). If you lose all your salamanders (or if you collide with the walls or with the salamanders) it's Game Over. To make things more interesting the game gets a little bit faster after every 10 mushrooms.<br/></p>\n<p>Play in your browser (although, at least on my PC, the music doesn't sound ok here): https://nes.scardua.net/lowas.html</p>\n<p>The ROM was tested on the FCEUX emulator (the music plays ok on it).<br/></p>\n<p>The music is Doctor, by George Buzinkai (RIP), turned into a FamiTracker cover by Baleish, which was then ported to FamiStudio with more simplified instruments by me.</p>\n<p>The audio engine is FamiTone2.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:04:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80a/80aa8c15a7a9c6837fb4ebed9f5d0765.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wendelscardua"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
