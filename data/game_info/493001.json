I would love to expand on this and turn it into a larger game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4d/a4d80ad101106b948ebee7ce3e88cd6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["seacliff"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
