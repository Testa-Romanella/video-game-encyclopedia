Originally I wanted to stream the webcam but the free server I use doesn't support that. Some interesting experiments are first, only your opponent can clearly tell if your attack is fully charged, you can only guess it by the slight screen shake when you charge; also you cannot see your own health. Hopefully these hiding of information will form a stronger connection between the two players, and have a fun time reading each other faces.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c46/c46468df96d27f55e8b9486831e3cfd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HoshiKawaGinza4Chome"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
