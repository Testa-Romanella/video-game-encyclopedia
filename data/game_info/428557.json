The game sticks with a simple pattern through all of its six levels: you move, you push a few buttons and you kill. There are no secret places, no alternative routes, no keys, no spritework, no special effects - nothing but you &amp; tons of zombies. This keeps the mod simple and fun, for a while, but it also makes you expect more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-14T21:39:24", "background_image": null, "website": "https://www.moddb.com/games/zombie-crisis", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
