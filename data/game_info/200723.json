The Kings debtors prison (dungeon / uranium mine), Was invaded by pan-dimensional Postal Lizard Men. They were Luddites whose jobs were downsized by automation. Now they invade other dimensions to destroy technology. Two plans were put forward to deal with the situation. <br/></p>\n<p>Plan A:<br/>Seal the entrance to the debtors prison (dungeon / uranium mine) so that the Uranium slowly poisons the Postal Lizard Men to death. This plan was rejected because Postal Lizard Men might go Godzilla.<br/></p>\n<p>Plan B:<br/></p>\n<p>This is where you come in,\u00a0 you are given a choice either pay poll tax (I wish if I didn't own so many poles ) or command the plant army to victory. If you win you will be given a Star Coins Plant to pay off your poll tax debt.<br/>Good Luck !!!.</p>\n\n<p>3) Plants<br/></p>\n<p>Star Coins Plant:<br/></p>\n<p>\"Star Coins Plants\" grows star coins (who says money doesn't grow on trees) which are automatically added to star coin score. Cactus Men Plant:<br/>Cactus Men Plant throws zucchinis (courgettes) which are Kryptonite against Postal Lizard Men.<br/></p>\n<p>Firestone plant:<br/></p>\n<p>Firestone plants are cowardly plants, they will not advance for loyalty to the King, but for the greed of Star Coins. When they advance they will deal with multiple Postal Lizard Men. If one firestone plant dies they all flee and it's game over.</p>\n\n<p>4) How to Win and How to Lose<br/></p>\n<p>To Win:<br/></p>\n<p>Succesfully advance your plant army eastwards through (dungeon / uranium mine) and destroy all pan-dimensional Postal Lizard Men (easier said than done).<br/></p>\n<p>To Lose:<br/></p>\n<p>If one firestone plant dies then all firestone plants will all flee.\u00a0 The pan-dimensional Postal Lizard Men will conquer the mine, then the kingdom, then the country,\u00a0 then the world, and then it's game over.</p>\n\n<p>5) How to play<br/></p>\n<p>Darker and Darker Dungeon is Controlled by mouse.<br/></p>\n<p>Star Coins Plant: To place a \"Star Coin Plant\" on the game grid, Move the (A) cursor to the (B) \"Star Coins Plant\" selection button at the bottom of screen and left click the mouse.
