I will be adding 10 free levels every 1 to 2 weeks so that why this cost money. Every 5 levels will introduce a new feature be it ability or enemy. I already have several of these features planned out. The 10th level will be a new boss. I decided to format the game like this so people will keep coming back. I will also optimize and enhance the game in any way i can very often and will make sure to listen to everyone feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25debda13b7190753a840b15adb36e84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RetroCop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
