Unless destroyed by a collision, these objects will continue on their orbital trajectories until you close the game...or it crashes.<br/></p>\n<p>In addition you can choose which body affects your gravity. Combine this with decent ballistics calculations and you get short, intense, and kinetic orbital firefights!</p>\n<p>I have created this project during a one week GameJam (the theme was \"Growing\") and refined it in another week of work. I think there is some potential here, but I don't know if I'll pursue it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:54:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/897f24484889a4b47f8e8867f21e4de1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hailcookies"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
