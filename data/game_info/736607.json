The Mapster, a floating pair of hands, has kidnapped game pieces and is forcing them to play on a custom-made game board. The Piecelings scramble to complete tasks on the stage to open the exit door and avoid attacks launched by the Mapster. Our game encourages teamwork among the Piecelings through collaborative objectives, and fosters an intense yet lighthearted competition between them and the Mapster. Mapstermind features a friendly and cute art style that is synonymous with party games and features a wonderful cast of characters for players to choose from.</p>\n<p>There are 4 controllers, one Mapster, three Piecelings.\u00a0 Must be played on one computer in couch co-op with 4 players.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/250dad3e67f8ffd3653be04e52f11e87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TallHatGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
