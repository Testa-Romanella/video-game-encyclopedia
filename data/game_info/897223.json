To win,all of them must be cleared before you run out of time. <br/><br/>There are 3 forms you can switch between, each with 2 basic attacks and 1 special attack (press attack 1 &amp; 2 at the same time). Switch between forms on the fly and combine their different attacks to maximize your damage.</p>\n<p>Weapons have unique properties and affect enemies (and their bullets) differently, so try out different strategies!</p>\n<p>The game is an experiment of trying to combine the two very different genres - so any feedback is very welcome.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Default keyboard controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys - movement</li><li>A - Form Switch Backward</li><li>S - Form Switch Forward</li><li>Z - Attack 1</li><li>X - Attack 2</li><li>Enter - Start</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T09:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6a/d6ac0c20e37c91f3de07b3a570620070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boghog"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
