Prisoners are brought in to have one of their most essential cognitive function tested, their memory. This experiment is made to test how far the human mind pushes itself for survival. Test subjects are given one chance to look at a grid of strategically placed tiles, which they cannot see once the test begins. The tiles exist in the same placed as showed in the map, however the human optics cannot perceive them essentially making them invisible. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T03:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89a73ea0e4d5804f9383915a325d8805.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicholas", "Bilal-A-G", "FlamingoeZpZ", "Rain8750", "Finklehimer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
