I wanted this project to be a small puzzle for players to figure out with a hint of creepiness. I was inspired by the idea of liminal spaces and transition. When we move to a new chapter of our life, we leave behind a small part of our old self and become new again. I loved this idea, and it inspired my work!</p>\n<p>Feel free to explore all the different pathways while playing, and make sure you check every corner if you want to complete the game! There is an endpoint, so if you get stuck do not be afraid to look around more.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The game should take you less than 5 minutes to complete! Thank you for taking the time to play!\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T15:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf9d19da4aa179b4b74bb62103188012.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jasper B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
