Avoid fish, collect coins and reach the ocean's floor as you strive to collect 10 sunken treasure chests!</p>\n<p>This was made over 7 days\u00a0for the VimJam (2020) with the theme \"There and Back\" with a \"Collectibles\" focus. We didn't get to add as much as we wanted, but the prototype is there and it's playable.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>If we continue the project in the future, we will aim for mobile release with much more content. Other dive sites, upgrade-able items like bigger oxygen tanks, a grapple that automatically moves the chest to the sub so you can keep diving, a propeller to dive faster, etc. Let us know your thoughts! We will continue development if there is enough interest.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button: Hold to swim faster, releasing will slow you down</p>\n<p>Mouse: Move diver left and right</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>All sound and art (except the font!)\u00a0assets were created by us, Fox and Lion Games,\u00a0for this jam.\u00a0 The code was all done during and for the jam.
