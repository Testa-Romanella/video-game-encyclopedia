Waste no time orchestrating the symphony of terror as you take on roles of various horror tropes and stalk the sets of multiple haunted houses in the pursuit of fear. Rev up the chainsaws, find the perfect hiding spots and stick to the shadows to bring life to the newest horror wonderland. Jump scares are your weapons, shadows are your cover. All that is left to do is to put on your mask and find the perfect guest.\r\n</p>\n<p>This project is in development, currently in the vertical slice.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Development Team</strong></p>\n<p>Kaylie White- Producer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jhon Vergara- Lead\u00a0Programmer\r\n  </p>\n<p>Connor Ramputi- Lead Artist\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Luke Fender- Lead Level Designer\r\n  </p>\n<p>Rox Follett- Artist and Lead Story Developer\r\n  </p>\n<p>Alana Brunson- UI/2D artist\r\n  </p>\n<p>Cameron Brito- 2D Artist\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Declan Ford- Researcher and Level Designer\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Dominic Lincourt- UI/UX Programmer\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Gabriel Vazquez- Programmer\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Nicholas Hennessy- 2D Artist\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Richard Derkman- Programmer\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Samantha Sander- 2D Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p>Tiana George- 2D Artist\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:34:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/715/7159270a1762f48623883f73073829c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alana Brunson"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
