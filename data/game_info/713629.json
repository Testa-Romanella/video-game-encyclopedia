Its not complete, and i will expand it and give it a major update, and more than likely a change in premise. There is a bug where you cant see your progress in the second \"mission\" so its going to be hard to self track, also only talk to the manager once, or the game might get glitched. All in all this a game with a win state, and it was made using some unfamiliar methods that I wanted to try. I hope you have fun playing it and please let me know each and every one of your criticisms in the comments below, this will help me know what needs to be improved.</p>\n\n<p>P:S. the file says its a detective game, but i had already made the unity file and started on a detective game before i changed the premise. It isnt a detective game though</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee7b08b6b9ecd486c383da7167125e12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chill Devs"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
