It is an overhead shooter with the main protagonist running around on foot, although it features more free roaming gameplay than traditional scrolling shooters. Among the differences in play mechanics, the Sega version allowed the player to create powerups that were fashioned by collecting machinery pieces and joining them together in different combinations. The storyline also differs from the game, instead casting the player not as the scientist from the original but as a teenage pest control worker known as Buzz who makes a variety of improvisational weapons with various materials combined with his pest control equipment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-04T10:44:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df1039c0b3ad903e5abf57e06cbc568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 231, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["Cinemaware"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
