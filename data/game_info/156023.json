For me, Tone is a song about a relationship (platonic or otherwise) that is in a rough patch and both people involved don't know where to go. I built this piece based off of a line in the song that goes, \"Trust me when I say I never change, I just tone down.\" To DVG this is a song about two people not understanding each other and how scary it can be to be vulnerable with a person. He goes on to say it's a love song, but not about falling in love. It's more about staying in love and learning how to communicate.<br/><br/>Tone by DVG<br/></p>\n<p>Explanation from DVG</p>\r\nSome other Inspirations for Chroma:<br/>https://ruanhang.itch.io/tour<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8d3111560318a0561ce5282d0dc03d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chris Williams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
