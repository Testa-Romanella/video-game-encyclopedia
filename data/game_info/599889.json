They have tried for over 2 months now, and Albert, the main character of the mini game here, is often\u00a0the fan favorite from that team, meaning that he's saved. On top of that he can name another one in his place to be in danger of leaving\u00a0(thus the gang of \"snakes\" lost many members and lost their minds with frustration).\u00a0 The slowest enemy in the mini-game\u00a0 is the slowest competitor in the show as well,\u00a0as well as the main instigator pushing his acolytes around.</p>\n<p>This mini game was\u00a0inspired by the GDQuest tutorials for the\u00a0Godot game engine.</p>\n<p>Programming and music by United Simesky Institutes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f5/1f5844e47db999de8720c4d80a10ee98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["simesky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
