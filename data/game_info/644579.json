There you meet other characters and choosing how you'll behave to them. When you find out that your friend is missing in a place, that isn't as good as you thought so, you're going to search for her. You'll have to choose which character you'll trust and who you'll cooperate with.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br/>The game is still in development and you can try out our free demo version which includes only the first chapter of the game, for now.<br/>You're playing this game from a first-person perspective so you're not playing as one of the characters.<br/>-<em> At The End of the chapter you can click on a button <strong>Title</strong> and then button <strong>yes\u00a0</strong>and you'll get to the main menu.</em> :)</p>\n<p><strong>Plans</strong><br/>This game does not yet have the whole art and looks. There would also be audio music. In the future, there would be around 5 characters with which you can interact.<br/>Later you can expect <em>more gameplay</em> in the future in the demo version and\u00a0<em>I'll fix typos.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T08:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7d2b09b7d38fbe57ce1f5b0795c056.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rebic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
