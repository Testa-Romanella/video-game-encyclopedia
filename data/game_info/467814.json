Its a simple game where you have to collect 5 mushrooms to unlock the portal and reach it to win the game. However whenever you collide with any of the running animals, your controls are updated to a new scheme. You can strategies this in a way that you hit the other type of animal and get back to original control scheme. The game also has a split screen mode for local multiplayer as well, which is the recommended play mode. <br/></p>\n<p>I have used Unity engine to develop this and I have open sourced the game code. You can find the source code here.<br/> https://bitbucket.org/maniacanshul/gmtk_jam_2020/src/master/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:48:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/1467a4808fb29522540ffb1b4fe159c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["maniacanshul"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
