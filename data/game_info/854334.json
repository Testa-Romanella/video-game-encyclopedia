This is where the actual game logic takes place.</li><li>Each game receives a dedicated\u00a0topic in the\u00a0Hedera\u00a0\u00a0decentralized ledger. Each round of the game is sent to this topic as a message (meaning the game's history is recorded in its entirety).</li><li>The front-end is built with the\u00a0Defold engine.</li><li>Players can resume their games by re-ingesting the game's history from its DLT topic.</li><li>I've also included the option to observe ongoing games.</li></ol>\n<p><em>Note: I am using the free tier of Colyseus which only supports a max of 15 users. If you can't connect, that's probably why.</em></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You play as an ornery dwarf intent on ruining the greenskins' birthday party. Simply move around the dungeon, and ram into enemies to kill them. Killing the purple 'g' designating the birthday goblin ends the game. There's no incentive to killing the other greenskins, and your health will not regenerate.</p>\n<p>You can use the numpad keys or keyboard to move. Click the 'Controls' button in-game to learn more.</p>\n<em>This simplistic pre-alpha is not indicative of the final game.</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf220a80ce8847ea75c537b5ee78b36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScalemaiL"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
