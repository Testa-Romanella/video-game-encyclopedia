You play as Iggy Blob, a punk slime trying to spread color to fight against the desaturated corporate city. Iggy Blob can invert their color in order to complete puzzles by interacting with buttons, doors, and moving colored platforms.</p>\n<p>Splatterpunk is set in a modern cityscape that lacks lots of color and life. Grey business blobs litter the streets, sapping the energy out of everyone around them with their business mumbo jumbo and monotonous office jobs. Iggy Blob is different though. He is on his way out of the corporate world, avoiding the deceit of the business people in favor of chasing his dreams as a Punk Rock Blob! Help Iggy by guiding him through the many obstacles put in his place by the scheming business blobs and ensuring he makes it to his underground punk blob concerts.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T07:40:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cc/4cc4ccbf100155ead2292dc18546e08a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Judah Avery"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
