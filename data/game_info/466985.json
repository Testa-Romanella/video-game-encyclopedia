They settled on calling the game \"Thea\", inspired by Laurens very own white german shepherd. Thea is a grossly overweight hound with equally astounding pull strength.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As John and Lauren decided to go through with the game, it got rather dark. It was decided that the player would be pulled by a massive beast (Thea) into a herd of wild cars.
