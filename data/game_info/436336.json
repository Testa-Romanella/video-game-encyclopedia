Made for indie games lab jam \"bullethell\".</p>\n<p>The project was the first game I've ever made, and the goal was to complete it in a week. I can see multiple areas for improvement, but I am overall happy with the end result. The harvester has 3 attacks, one of them by blocking player projectiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything in the \"game\" is done by me. The game is done using godot engine, and art using clip studio.</p>\n<p>The game requires keyboard and mouse to be played.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T02:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1c/b1ccf63a7d31233fb233e085a45eda53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Telomeri"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
