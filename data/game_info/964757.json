But hey, you had plenty of time to work out and dream about the wonders of the world. Sucks to be you though, people eat slime, corruption is rife and everyone wants to fight you\u2026 But maybe you can find your father and become the \u2018dark fist\u2019 people whisper about, somehow you could actually be humanity's savior, the one who uncovers the super secret secrets of the Goodness Corporation\u2026 Or not. It\u2019s a choose your own adventure, stay in the garage if you want.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been 20 long years since a nameless cool guy rose from the streets, punched the big bad, found his father and everyone was really happy or something. Welcome to the future, it's corrupt, sea shells have replaced toilet roll and everything's cyberpunk now. Walk the same, but now neon, streets as you're thrown into an adventure filled with hilarity, 80\u2019s nostalgia and punching. Even more punching than before.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPunch, kick and cheat your way through, if you want. Becoming the best damn fighter aint easy, it takes time, dedication, dollars and training! Increase your stats and techniques, plan your match and create your own incredibly awesome school of fighting! Sounds better than losing and everyone laughing at you. Whilst nothing beats good old fashioned blood, sweat and tears, neuro training and illegal software sure sound tempting. Even if there is a slight risk you\u2019ll be exposed as a fraud and your last brain cell will pack up and leave.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLife in the rat race is fast paced, time consuming and requires effective management to survive, Punch Club 2 is the same! It\u2019s literally a simulation game! Manage your time and funds, whilst climbing to the top of the fighting leagues, solving crimes, working for the police, mob, mafia and about anyone else you cross paths with. Completing quests will give you access to new fighting schools, moves, dollars, good person points and even the Lion Queen on VHS! Stop reading the GOG page and get grinding!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first rule of Punch Club, is tell everyone about Punch Club, wishlist it now or prepare to fight (for legal reasons, we won\u2019t actually fight you).\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-11T05:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0ed733bea0b0678830f65fcd085e9d9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 506, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazy Bear Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["tinyBuild"], "esrb_rating": null}
