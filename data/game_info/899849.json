You play as a self aware AI piloting a service droid. The game takes place on mars decades after Earth was deemed uninhabitable. Many of the assets were not my original work\u00a0and are credited accordingly. Please don't feel the need to donate, I was primarily uploading this as a demonstration of my coding capabilities.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/>If you find any bugs throughout your playthrough I'd appreciate it if you report them to me. I'll fix them when I'm able. I playtested this game numerous times but I'm sure there's something I missed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T16:50:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e9/1e91f5782459158a28b03495f70b86ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calinator444"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
