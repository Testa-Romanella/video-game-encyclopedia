Fight against your own body and race up the spine till you reach the brain. Your aim is to get to the grain at the very top of the spine, without falling all the way down.</p>\n<p>This rage game also contains partial checkpoints, where when you complete a puzzle, you get a temporary checkpoint. This helps you, so that if you fall, you don't go ALL THE WAY BACK. However, they disappear after one use.</p>\n<p>Sorry about the minimal art style, i had some scope issues so that's the best I could come up with for now. With optimisations, this could probably become a WebGL game, however, I don't have enough time and its just not well made enough in the backend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T12:10:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/687/6871f7a92a8c204182522cf41d15ae98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DoctorLeaf"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
