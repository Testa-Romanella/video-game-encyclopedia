Suitable for A500</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Svlcvss MMXVIII - Sturdust tunnel that can actually rotate. AGA\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Svlcvss Side Track - Sturdust tunnel that shifts the lines on x axis making the curves. AGA</p>\n\n<p>Source codes for engines are included. A bit messy and not commented well but the technique is actually simple so I think its not that hard to understand. However I'm here open to any questions. Source codes are in Blitz Basic. Use them freely. As I dont have much spare time, I got twins for xmas, I'd really like if someone would make a game out of this. I would connect him with gfx artist that already mastered preparing gfx for these tunnels.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T05:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/912/9125e6ef0c95e06b5074cf1c50eb7243.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amiga Cobe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
