I've been working on Adams Ascending over the last three years and a half, solo. This has been a journey of growth and revelation as a self taught developer. My hope with Adams Ascending is to be a voice for inspiring others to \"ascend\" into their own dreams, no matter how impossible it may be. I'm humbled to have the opportunity to share the story of Adams Ascending with the world. Thanks for your time! Keep inspiring.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Nick DePalo", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/2122cdc0de55000b40814b75ed42b62c.jpg", "website": "https://www.parableworlds.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Parable Worlds"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Parable Worlds"], "esrb_rating": null}
