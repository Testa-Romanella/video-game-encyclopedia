Fans flock from all four corners of the globe to watch robots duke it out. Competitors rent a bot and send it against a series of other bots. If their bot falls, they lose.

You are randomly assigned a rental bot. Maybe you\u2019ll become the newest champion of the arena. Maybe you\u2019ll fail miserably. Maybe you\u2019re just here to listen to the goofy robot voices. And maybe you\u2019ll get a new friend out of the deal. Who knows!</p>\n<p>Get your bot and go forth!</p>\n<ul><li>Turn-based interactive fiction singleplayer battle royale.
