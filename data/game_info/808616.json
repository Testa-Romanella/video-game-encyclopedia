In this exciting yet simple race against time, you must get through as many stages as you can without losing all 3 lives!</p>\n\r\nProcedurally Generated Stages\r\n<p>Every time you play, it will be different! The stages are randomly generated and placed along the track, so you will never play the same level twice! Not to mention, the levels are INFINITELY long! How far can you get?</p>\n\n\r\nScreenshots taken inside Unity's Engine\r\nMessage from the Creator\r\n<p>This is my first game. I put a lot of work into it, and even though it's no triple A game, its my game.\u00a0This entire project has and will continue to be one of the best and most exciting learning experiences I have ever been apart of, and I hope you stick around to see what I have in store for the future. I have plenty of ideas, and I'm slowly gaining the tools and knowledge I need to finally make them work. Thank you for playing my game!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flame :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T19:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/761/761f600c0dee28fa006e6b861ec74e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flame34x"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
