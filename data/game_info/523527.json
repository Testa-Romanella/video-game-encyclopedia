Place machines on the map to try and stop the balls from getting to the exit! Choose from tons of machines, like Cannons, money makers, spikes, and more! Choose from 5 cool maps, grass, desert, snow, city, or ocean. Beating all the balls in a stage will make you hopefully unlock a new machine to use... and maybe even a new mode!</p>\n<p><strong>Note: This game is old and pretty buggy, which is why a remastered version is in development with better graphics, more content, and less bugs!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/182ac5d96b5e76c2c5597a9e3e136151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeHe169"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
