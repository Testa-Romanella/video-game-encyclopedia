But then you discover the reason: a strange creature, self-called Dream Lord, captured you and wants to keep you with him forever. Even death isn't an escape from him... Or is it?</p>\n<p>This simple game is the first product of our team that, at least for the moment, is\u00a0called Neo-Team (there was indeed an \"old team\" before). You'll face some puzzles to challenge Dream Lord and to show him that you can actually make choices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>==================== CREDITS ====================</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Neo-Team staff:</p>\n<p>- Daniel Libonati \"danlibs\" Gomes: Game Design/Level Design/Programming</p>\n<p>- Julio \"Abraham_An\" Albarran: Character Design/Animations/Tileset</p>\n<p>- Rok \"Tirinius\" Kravanja: Programming</p>\n<p>- William \"Fonysony\" Santos: Programming/SFX Design</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Other assets there were used in this project:</p>\n<p>- RPGTalk by Seize Studios</p>\n<p>- Evil Bunny font by Sheenie Richards</p>\n<p>- Harmonies of Time by Gonzalo Varela</p>\n<p>- Loop &amp; Music Free by marching dream</p>\n<p>- Action RPG Music Free by VGcomposer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:43:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed5/ed5856ae86a10a40d5eb3f32c9286298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neo-Team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
