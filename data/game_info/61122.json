But unlike its classical counterparts, it does not rely on servers to put people together. Instead, DiveReal uses an overlay that grows as more people get in. <br/>For the user, this means a different experience: the world is not anymore divided in \"rooms\", \"islands\" or \"realms\" but accepts everyone, possibly millions, in a unique seamless space.<strong>EXPLORE</strong>Take a tour in Paris, walk on the streets of New York or dive in Copacabana! On desktop or in VR, dive in the real world and find your favorite places.<br/><strong>MEET</strong>Explore the real world and meet people from around the planet !
