Second, is few gamemodes based on this mechanics:<br/><br/>1. Journey mode, the main one. Go throw levels, making different tasks with different limits, step-by-step watching new mechanics (different kind of chips with anotther mechanics).\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Puzzles. Number puzzle - just few blocks, you needs to place it in correct order on field to clear it. Challenging, needs more brain work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Arena, or Rating. No time, no tasks, just pick up field and try to reach global top of players. More relaxing gameplay.</p>\n<p>Project is live on Google Play, but we're working on making it better and any advices would appreciated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42e62e5c4fdf6cf0c299e27cf3767ef4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["twosquares"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
