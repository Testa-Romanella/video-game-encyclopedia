So far you've only seen the world through thick iron bars. However, things changed when a sudden incident blew a hole in the wall of the mysterious factory you were kept in. That not only gave you a view of the world outside, but destroyed the cage you've been kept in. The rest is up to you, will you seize your dreams?</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Any directional input - Move\u00a0\u00a0(Seriously, i tested this thing with arrows, WSAD, Steam Controller, DualShock 4 and even a little USB Nes pad i got from a shady website. All work just fine, left is left, right is right.)</p>\n<p>Space, Left Mouse Button - Flap your wings and fly.</p><p>Right Mouse Button - Reset to last spawn point.</p>\n<p>Sound effects by ZapSplat.</p>\n<p>Also, a short message. This is the first time i tried to make a game in 3 days, and i got to say the deadline is much tighter than the previous 7 days i tried. This project was supposed to be deep and stuff, but while writing this i just feel kinda tired and just want to submit it to the jam. I hope you enjoyed this one, i know i did (For the first 90% of the time, last 10% are stresful as heck).
