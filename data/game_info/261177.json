This is a bit of a dating sim. You assume the role of Jane.\u00a0 A young woman who just moved to a new town. Her best friend invited her to a local bar and restaurant popular with the\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0 community\u00a0called \"The Henhouse. Jane is trying to meet new people and possibly start a relationship.</p><p>For now character dialogue tress have been reduced to have something playable for the Yuri Game Jam. I had to sacrifice some content including music and small fetch quests. There will be full dating\u00a0options. I will continue making updates to expand on conversations and give more diversity to interactions. I wish to put in a character select and naming system to customize the experience. I have planned a full graphic overhaul as well. There are two original music pieces in the game. I wish to expand on them and add more original music in future updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b23/b23a2aa04347f0249dad1fee419bc6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Takaonna"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
