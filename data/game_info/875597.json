Available at any time, usable with no restrictions, and completely seamless.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Explore the war-torn Wilhelmsh\u00f6her Allee in Kassel, Germany in two separate, hand-crafted timelines built from the ground up around the Time Travel mechanic.</p>\n\r\nUP YOUR ARSENAL\r\n\n<p>\u00a0 With 6 different weapons to choose from, you're spoiled with options. Wield classic WW2 weaponry such as the iconic MP40, or go Cyberpunk on their asses with Laser Rifles and Railguns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Each weapon has its pros and cons, and they're all unique in their own ways. Find them all and experiment to dominate the combat puzzle.</p>\n\r\nPLAY IT SMART\r\n\n<p>\u00a0 Use your Time Travel Glasses to your advantage. Pop in and out of the timelines mid-combat to avoid enemy fire, go behind enemies and ambush them, or get yourself some breathing room to reload.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 But don't just point and shoot! Weapon switching is a key strategy to your survival, since <em><strong>enemies from the past take more damage from weapons from the future, and vice versa.</strong></em></p>\n\r\nScreen Tears Team\r\n\r\nJustTheDani\r\nComposer (Soundtrack) / Audio Designer (SFX) / 2D Artist / Concept Artist / 3D Texture Painting / 3D Texturing / Game Designer\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/justthedani<br/>itch.io:\u00a0justthedanii.itch.io<br/>Spotify:\u00a0sptfy.com/KL5N\r\n</p>\r\nLuca Boechat Marc\u00edlio\r\nLevel Designer /\u00a03D Artist / Animator / Technical Artist (VFX) / 3D Texturing / Support 3D Texture Painting / Balancing / Support Bugfixing / Game Designer\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/lucaboechat<br/>itch.io:\u00a0boecharts.itch.io<br/>Twitter:\u00a0twitter.com/LucaBoechat\r\n</p>\r\nMason Smart\r\nSolo Programmer / Bugfixing / Support Technical Artist (VFX) / Game Designer\r\n<p>LinkTree:\u00a0linktr.ee/everyth1ngninja<br/>itch.io:\u00a0everyth1ngninja.itch.io\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to\r\nVitor Mariano\r\nFor swooping in and helping us with some major bugfixes\r\n<p>itch.io: vitormariano.itch.io/</p>\n\n\r\nCC-Licensed third-party assets used:\r\n<ul><li>Our in-game characters were created by heavily modifying vinrax's Male PS1 Character Model</li><li>Some textures were sampled from ambientcg</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T13:46:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b93/b936a23054a0766cadf1cb14649a1856.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boecharts", "just the dani"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
