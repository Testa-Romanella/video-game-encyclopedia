If you don't want to rot to death, it's up to you to find a way out and explore the island you've been trapped on with a girl you'll meet outside named Mila. Like you, she has no idea how she got to the island or what's going on. If you want to get out of there, both of you are going to have to work to together to escape! If you're not careful, your choices could lead to your death or you'll just have to die of old age alone. Whichever comes first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T03:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c5977a382272a053d2e972eaf090a8ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dollarluigi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
