The astronaut is currently unconscious, and you as an AI have to transport him and the mysterious materials he is carrying to the space post box. Unfortunately the only control you have is the ability to shift the weight of your astronaut in order to reach the goal. You must be careful though, the material you are carrying is subject to act erratically and may affect the way you move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move the mouse from left to right of the astronaut\u00a0in order to shift the astronaut's weight (shown by the little propeller around the astronaut). Click in order to propel the astronaut.</p>\n<p>You may only click on the side where the propeller is not present.</p>\n<p>When the material turns red, you become twice as heavy, so keep that in mind before propelling!</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Music Credits:</p>\n<p>Blippy Trance by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/5759-blippy-trance<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6ac1729f591967515723e7c1ff02160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kisen", "waddaffak"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
