Well, that\u2019s a shame, but we\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s done. <br/>You have to be very careful not to steer your cow in any of the obstacles awaiting you during your flight. <br/>I mean, why would you want to go hitting a cow against\u2026things? <br/>That would be crazy. <br/>Keep in mind, that typical cows usually wriggle during rope-secured flights. <br/>We know that kind of stuff, duh.<br/><br/><strong>EARN COWCOINS</strong> <br/><br/>For every kidnapped cow you will be earning cowcoins, obviously. When you\u2019ve earned enough of the marvellous currency, it\u2019s time to go shopping! Sure, you can buy some reasonable gear, which will enhance your flying (why would you do that?) or you can exchange your money for a crazy beak, which will match your mad flapping (highly recommended)! <br/>What else will you find in the virtual store? <br/>You will have to play to find out!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd307f25cc4c4c601948520170f2cf59.jpg", "website": "http://fatdoggames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 391, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dev4play"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
