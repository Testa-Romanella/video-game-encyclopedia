Humans have expanded their reach to beyond the stars, but their hunger for expansion came at a cost. A species of space whale was discovered and was hunted to near extinction for it\u2019s exotic meat. Today, only one remains. A safe haven has been found in the N76-GD4 Nebula, but the journey is treacherous. The galaxy swarms with rogue AI units and aggressive space jellyfish. Defend your whale and use your plunder to give it life. And at all costs: Keep. It. Alive.</p>\n<p>\tOriginal soundtrack composed in the 72 hours by BROOD MACHINA (https://broodmachina.bandcamp.com/)</p>\n<p>It sounds like people are running into a bug in the tutorial, so if no more prompts appear after killing the enemy on the first level: After you kill the first enemy you need to fly close to the whale and press F to deposit your resources, then press G to move on. Sometimes the tutorial prompts break and don\u2019t tell you to do these last steps.
