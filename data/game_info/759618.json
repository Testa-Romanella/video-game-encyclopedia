Games such as Wordle or Babble Royale show how much the \"free depth\" of language itself can be used for game design purposes. WikiArena applies a similar approach,  using the \"internet's meta\" as its core language.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T02:51:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582a063b74bcb150b59b33ecf79016dd.jpg", "website": "https://www.fischergamedesign.com/games-portfolio/wikiarena", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Fabian Fischer", "Ludokultur"], "genres": ["Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Ludokultur"], "esrb_rating": null}
