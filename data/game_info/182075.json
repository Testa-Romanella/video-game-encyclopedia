If you enjoyed it leave a comment and maybe tell me how I can improve it.</p><p>Don't feel inclined to pay for it, it is supposed to be freeware. But, if you would like to support a young indie developer who is just starting out, feel free to give a dollar for it. :)</p><p>The best way you could support though is to check back later as I create more. I am on Twitter and I have a blog. I will try to post cool stuff like developer updates, screenshots and more. For the best gameplay experience I recommend downloading the game.</p><p> Stay tuned for more\u2026</p><p>Peace Out.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>sounds:</p><p>guitatguy1985</p><p>SpliceSound</p><p>andre.rocha.nas</p><p>amthomas101</p><p>Noise For Fun</p><p>Fonts:</p><p>Minisystem</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcdc573cb1b5ea713d0d5cbbb758c996.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Cameron Roberts"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
