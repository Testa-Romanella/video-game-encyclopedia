You only have some much health. Can you win? To Win you just need to get 5 laps. This game IS REALLY HARD! You need to dodge the AI to win. Every lap adds two new AI. The game starts with 7. There will be 17 AI. They are faster than you ,but if you juke them, they will fly right past you. They have no handles. Good Luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e95/e9554f8d77ebf79500d59b924fe6cb7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cranfill_Crusher"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
