There's no guarantee you'll find your way back though.</p>\n<p>Hiraeth is a narrative/exploration game set in an endless procedural wood. Littered throughout the wood are lonesome\u00a0characters you can chat to.</p>\n<p>TO WALK: If using a controller, use the LEFT JOYSTICK. If using mouse/keyboard, use WASD or ARROW KEYS.</p>\n<p>TO LOOK AROUND: If using a controller, use the RIGHT JOYSTICK. If using mouse/keyboard, use the MOUSE.</p>\n<p>TO INTERACT: If using a controller, use the A or B button. If using keyboard/mouse use SPACE.</p>\n<p>CHOOSING DIALOGUE OPTIONS: During conversations, you can scroll through dialogue options with your left joystick, or with W and S or up and down keys. To select the option, use your controller's A or B button, or press SPACE. There is a known bug currently which sometimes 'deselects' all dialogue options. As a temporary fix to this, you can 'wake up' the game by clicking anywhere on the screen, and an option will be reselected so you can scroll through them again as normal.</p><p>Hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-17T02:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9edd14737dd75248d0fa07c465397c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Meirian"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
