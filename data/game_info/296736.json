This project was focused on player attachment to minimalist procedurally-generated environments.\u00a0The build is packaged with one seed, so you will always experience the same world on the same system.</p><p>Inspired by FPV drone flights, this week's game is about being lost in a city and finding yourself. You begin the game with the drone in front of you, but every time you land the drone on your body, you warp to a different location on the map. Take your headset off to get a sense of where you are, and put it back on to fly home.</p><p>Enjoy playing with the tiny \"physics engine\" (in heavy quotes)\u00a0I wrote for the game.\u00a0Tip:\u00a0many people\u00a0like to fly straight up immediately, but the auto-tilt actually makes it more difficult to find targets at a distance (this was done on purpose). See if you can discover the tradeoff.</p><p>Made in the burner engine.
