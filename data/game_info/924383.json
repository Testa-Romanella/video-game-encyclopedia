Your role is to help it reach the surface in this 2d up-scrolling platformer. The path taken by the droplet is a root system. The latter is composed of platforms to help you progress but also bugs and spikes that kill you. The droplet thankfully has a dash ability that helps it reach the goal. The game features 3 trees whose root systems go from easiest to hardest.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Artwork by Emma</li><li>Programming by Anass and Eoin</li><li>Game Design by Olly</li><li>Audio by Jordan</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T14:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3d/d3d0bb05a23d854fb704a254806cc483.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anass Doublal"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
