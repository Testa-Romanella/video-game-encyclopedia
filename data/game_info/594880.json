I can hear it pulsating and bouncing in your veins!\"</em></p>\n<p>\r\nYou are the chosen one. Of course. <br/>You've been hearing the holy signals for quiet a long time now. It's time to embark on a journey and prove your worth to the five guardians. Prepare your sickest dance moves and master every floor of the cold, unforgiving underground. Maybe you'll even make new freinds along the way, who knows? <br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by Devon Wolters and me for Ludum Dare 48. We laughed. We cried. But at least we finished on time somehow. It was planned to be a rhythm game but we're not quiet sure if it qualifies as such. It has a strong focus on music though. One playtrough should take you about 20 minutes. <br/></p>\n<p>And now, chosen one, step forward and fulfill your holy mission!\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3ddd2fba74e968884ecb35448eb4619a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodeCavy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
