Thank you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is made for <em><strong>Ludum Dare 45</strong></em> with theme: <em>Start with Nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>In this game, you literally start with nothing but a lever in the middle of the black sea of pixels. With each lever, you get more and more. It is same with the enemies. Enemies are lesser in the beginning and gradually, gets more and more. Anyway, I don't think I did a great job with the theme. But I am really happy with the game itself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T08:19:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a70/a704ead2cd74d3e33296dd577463fd7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Programmer Cheema"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
