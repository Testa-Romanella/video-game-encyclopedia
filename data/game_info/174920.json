Kill, vault over logs and eat mushrooms to survive.\u00a0 Controls are in the top right of the screen + escape to exit whenever.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev Notes;</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is just a fun little game I've been working on recently, it's very primitive ATM and ik its just a arcade shooter however that is temporary. (everything is placeholder and subject to change)</p>\n<p>Comment below your HIGH-SCORE, mine is 185 on medium. I'm sure you'll beat it no problem :D</p>\n<p>Plans for the future include; making it open world, inventory, crafting/building, multiplayer? (if i can do it aha), procedurally generated terrain and loot, more weapons and items, more characters / NPCs and some additional survival mechanics...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to add any cool ideas you would like to add for a game like this, course i can't promise anything but if its cool and i am capable enough i shall add it.</p>\n<p>Let me know of any bugs. If you experience game breaking bugs try restarting the exe. from my experience of playing i have not experienced any but i am curious to find out what happens on your end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13f07bb5e2d40c65fe7afa7c99d5cfdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AstroPolski"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
