You can find links to Oculus store here.<br/>Rift:\u00a0https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/2211532715627723<br/>Go:\u00a0https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/2213141572055850</p>\n<p>Now... We see as the whole internet is calling for fnaf release to Oculus Quest and we would like to give you guys something like it.\u00a0 We want to give you access to our game for free through\u00a0technique of Sideload, if you are familiar with this. If not just google it its pretty easy\u00a0\u00a0. You can download and install this games build on your Quest for free this way!\u00a0<br/>You might be asking why don't we just release this on Oculus Quest store but the truth is it is much harder then other stores, since the level of game has to be really high for the game to get it published into the App store. And quite frankly we didn't even tried to publish it because we know our game is not there yet, but we will keep working hard on the game so we can reach the level so we can get it published! We won't be updating the version of the build that is available for download, but in the future we will definitely support cross-buy if we will qet to Quest App store.<br/>In future updates: Flashlight feature, Replay ability, Better interaction with monsters etc..<br/><br/>If you would guys like to support us. Go and buy our game in Oculus Rift, Go App store or here\u00a0\u00a0SteamVR will follow..<br/></p>\n<p>If you wish to bring some ideas all are welcome in our Discord:<br/>http://discord.paperbunker.cz<br/>And you can also follow us on twitter or instagram<br/>https://twitter.com/paperbunker<br/>https://instagram.com/paperbunkergames</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for your support!</strong><br/><br/>------<br/>Dig and find freedom through old mine, while running away from bloodthirsty horde of monsters, which is chasing you.
