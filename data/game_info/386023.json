Prototype includes a short level with 6 rooms and a mini-boss (sends you back to the title screen when beat, no time for a cutscene unfortunately). Originally planned to be longer, but shortened to fit the time constraints of the game jam - would love to continue expanding and improving the game following the conclusion of the game jam.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong>:<br/>Reach the last room of the castle and defeat the Hellbeast to win.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reflect projectiles</strong> by attacking when the projectile is directly ahead of you.</li><li>Meat can be obtained and consumed to restore health by pausing and viewing your inventory and selecting \"Use.\"</li><li>Dash to dodge attacks, close distances and traverse long gaps.</li><li>Gain XP by defeating enemies. Your stats increase with every level up.</li><li>Read more about Monsters and how many you've defeated in the Bestiary in the pause menu.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/>Keyboard:</p>\n<ul><li>[WASD] or [Arrow Keys] - Move</li><li>[SPACE] - Jump</li><li>[Hold SPACE] - Jump Higher</li><li>[Q] - Dash</li><li>[F] - Attack</li><li>(Menus) [ESC] - Pause </li><li>(Menus) [SPACE] or [E] or [ENTER] - Select</li><li>(Menus) [B] - Back</li></ul>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<ul><li>Left Joystick - Move</li><li>[A] - Jump</li><li>[Hold A] - Jump Higher</li><li>[LB] or [RB] - Dash\r\n</li><li>[X] - Attack</li><li>(Menus) [ESC] - Pause (Keyboard Needed)</li><li>(Menus) [SPACE] or [E] or [ENTER] - Select (Keyboard Needed)</li><li>(Menus) [B] - Back (Keyboard Needed)</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming - StealthNinja</li><li>All credits for art and audio assets are included in the text file \"credits.txt\"</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T06:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b44a9b04a99370001920df214664fd64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StealthNinja"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
