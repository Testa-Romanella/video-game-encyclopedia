Every executable is a person or a tool and every folder is a place.</p><p>To open the chest (a command line tool) in the center of town, you will have to learn how use the files that inhabit the town. There is no way to cheat. Everything in the game is just a file on your computer and can be treated as such.</p><p>While some experience with the terminal is probably helpful, the game does not require anything intense, and this could be a fun way to learn about a powerful part of your computer that you are less familiar with.</p><p>Source code available at: https://github.com/andymasteroffish/terminal_town</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1b3848d3d1a3972c96042ffaba35f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["AndyMakes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
