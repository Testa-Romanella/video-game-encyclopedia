Some keys do the exact same thing, such as the bracket keys or<br/>page up/page down keys. This will mostly be your preference, and possibly what sort<br/>of keyboard your computer has.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>At the top of the screen you\u2019ll find three boxes displaying your current resources, which<br/>include minerals, gas, and energy. You will need to collect more of these, which we\u2019ll<br/>get into later. 255 is the maximum number of resources you can store at any given<br/>time. Next to the resources is a running clock showing how long the game has been<br/><br/><br/><br/>going. On the bottom you\u2019ll find your current coordinates. This is very important for<br/>knowing where your units are, especially in relation to the enemy bases. More on this<br/>later. The bottom three windows are there to give you different types of information.<h3>SWITCHING BETWEEN UNITS</h3><br/>In this game, you will be controlling dozens of different units, so it\u2019s important to<br/>know how to switch between them. There is more than one way to accomplish it, and<br/>you should learn all of the ways.<br/><br/><strong>Browse</strong> - If the unit you want to control is visible on the screen, you can press <strong>Return</strong><br/>to enter browse mode. At this point, a small box-like cursor will appear on the screen.<br/>Use the arrow keys to move this box around until it is positioned on the unit or<br/>building you wish to select, then press <strong>Return</strong> again. You can even select enemy units,<br/>but you can only look at their status, not control them.<br/><br/><strong>Cycle Units</strong> - For things like tanks, builders, and frigates. If the unit you want is not<br/>currently visible and you don\u2019t feel like driving to the unit, you can press the <strong>Tab</strong><br/>key to cycle to the next unit, wherever it may be. The cycle is based on unit number,<br/>so sometimes it may seem there is no rhyme or reason as to which unit it goes to<br/>next. You can also use the plus and minus keys on the keyboard to move forward and<br/>backwards through your units. With practice, this is the fastest way to switch between<br/>units.<br/><br/><strong>Cycle Buildings</strong> - For things like factories, smelters, and radar stations. If the building<br/>you want is not currently visible, you may press <strong>Page-up / Page-down</strong> to cycle back<br/>and forth between them, very much like the unit cycle. You can also use the bracket<br/>keys [] to accomplish the same thing. Solar panels are purposely skipped during<br/>the cycle because there are often numerous panels and you can\u2019t actually control<br/>them anyway. If you want to select a solar panel you must use the browse feature.<br/><br/><strong>Hot Keys</strong> - You can use the number row 0-9 at the top of your keyboard to assign spe-<br/>cific units or buildings that you need to access more quickly. Press <strong>Shift + Number</strong> to<br/>assign a number key to the current unit. You can then use that number key to quickly<br/>switch to the assigned unit. This will be especially useful during battles.<h3>CONTROLLING UNITS</h3>Your first order of business after starting the game should be establishing infrastructure and collecting resources.<br/>Without them, you won\u2019t be able to do much.<br/>You\u2019ll need all 3 types of resources: Minerals, Gas, and Energy.<br/>It may require some hunting around the map to<br/>find the minerals and gas, so we\u2019ll talk about<br/>those first. You can find these on the map.<br/>There are usually deposits of minerals<br/>clumped together. Some maps have a<br/>lot, and some have very few, so use them<br/>wisely. In this screenshot, you can see<br/>several rocks and crystals in a formation.<br/>Both the rocks and crystals can be used<br/>as mineral sources. The formations that<br/>look like volcanos are gas vents. You will need to build a refinery on top of them.<br/>The more the better.<br/><br/>Different types of rocks will process at different speeds and also have different yields.<br/>Also, the minerals can look somewhat different depending on which graphics mode<br/>you are in. This chart shows each one and how many minerals you can expect to get<br/>as a result of mining each kind.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Different types of rocks will process at different speeds and also have different yields.<br/>Also, the minerals can look somewhat different depending on which graphics mode<br/>you are in.
