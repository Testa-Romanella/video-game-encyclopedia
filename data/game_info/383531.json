Compete against other players to feed the hungry dragon queen as you score points to win a set number of rounds. All players start a match with the same loadout. As players win rounds, losing players will vote to take away the winner's powers, making it harder for them to win (putting the 'Depower' in 'DepowerBall').<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBecause players' skills diminish as a match rolls on, you need to adapt and change strategies round by round in order to win.
