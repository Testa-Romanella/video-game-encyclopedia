{"id": 92512, "slug": "boolean-escape", "name": "Boolean Escape", "name_original": "Boolean Escape", "description": "<p><strong>Boolean Escape</strong> is inspired by the Room-Escape Flash games of the early 2000's.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone who plays will lock their key into a combination safe. Who's key you find is entirely down to you guessing a correct combination. It might take you a while but eventually you'll discover a key. If you don't have the patience you can play Boolean Escape without a key.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A boolean can be true or false. A button can be on or off. A lever can be up or down. A key can lead to safety or can lock you away forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a short game (probably about 10 minutes) where the aim of the game is to escape the strange world you find yourself in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your fate lies in the hands of a previous player.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Info:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Given the nature of this game, it's important that you have an internet connection when playing.\u00a0</li><li>Don't pick combination 1234 to lock away your key. It's the most obvious and most likely to be over written by someone else!</li><li>Despite testing I may have missed some bugs. If this is the case I'll most likely discover them while watching videos of other players.\u00a0</li><li>Crazy secure firewalls might interfere with submitting keys. It works for me :)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I have no control over the names people have submitted with their keys. That said I'll monitor what is being submitted and anything racist, sexist, homophobic or offensive will be removed.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/696/6960974834564226cd00f9578982fbc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dan Sanderson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
