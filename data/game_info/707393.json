This was a semester-long project that I worked on and off on, and is essentially a roguelike game based on numbers.</p>\n<p>You play as a solitary character in the center of the map. Like a tower, you can fire in any direction using the 1-9 keys and left mouse button.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are currently 4 enemies. Each enemy corresponds to a number from 1-9; to deal damage to an enemy, you must attack the enemy with the corresponding number attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you defeat enemies, you'll gain experience, and eventually level up! Each level earns you an upgrade point, which may be spent to purchase upgrades in the upgrades menu. There are three upgrades available in this prototype.</p>\n<p>Your high score is saved. What will your best score be?<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:08:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5976ba55eeb99146e9f5b63053744f2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tenodru"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
