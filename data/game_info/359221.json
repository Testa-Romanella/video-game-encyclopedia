Meet your friends and coworkers no matter where they are, explore worlds created by the community and import your own models, videos, images, audio files and more, all in realtime.<br/><br/>If you feel like it, you can grab any of the building tools and start creating (or editing) anything from an avatar, interactive object to an entire world. Neos makes no distinction between entities, everything is accessible, editable and programmable (as long as you have the permission to do so).<br/><br/>Editing can be as simple as gluing things together, putting a material into a material gun and shooting the surfaces in the world or fiddling with particle system knobs. There\u2019s also more advanced visual scripting,and scene inspectors for editing object and component hierarchy. Did we mention that you do all that in VR and multiplayer too? It\u2019s like being inside a game engine!<br/><br/>We have taken great care to build Neos to be very futureproof and versatile, no matter who you are and what your background is. It\u2019s based on novel engine architecture designed and programmed from the ground up to give you unprecedented amount of control.<br/><br/>You can make Neos into whatever you want it to be, focusing on what you want to do inside in VR, with Neos transparently making sure that everything part of a single virtual universe, where sharing what you made is as simple as handing it to others or sending via message.<br/><br/>So come and become part of our amazing community, whether you want to just hang out, visualize your models, build a cool world or a silly item, or even collaborate on projects with engineers and scientists. Neos is a metaverse for all of us.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T00:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a0/4a0ba829c0e2ecf1237edee3022f839f.jpg", "website": "http://neosvr.com", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 240, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 483, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frooxius", "Solirax"], "genres": ["Educational", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Solirax"], "esrb_rating": null}
