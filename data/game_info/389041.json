No perks. No pay to win. No random spawns. No BS. Just FPS.<br/><br/>Re-deploy into nostalgia with Tip of the Spear: Task Force Elite, an online multiplayer FPS inspired by classic titles from the late 1990s and early 2000s. An easy learning curve lets players jump straight into the fray, and deep mechanics provide great depth and replay value. <br/><br/><strong>Storm compounds, raid tunnels, assault towns, and secure an abandoned airfield.</strong><br/><br/>Levels feature designated enemy spawn points, ensuring the opposing team never randomly spawns behind players. Re-enlist for classic game modes, including Team King of the Hill and Team Deathmatch. Engage in close quarters combat in urban locales with house-to-house warfare, or creep along the rooftops and reign fire from above.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Stalk mountain ridges and snipe targets from miles away.</strong><br/><br/>Wage war across open world landscapes over 10 miles (16 kilometers) in length. Snipe targets from incredible distances with a realistic ballistics system.
