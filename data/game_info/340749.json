Flight in a tight space against an onslaught of enemies. Survive as long as you can. This is an early version of this game. Depending on how much traction this gets will determine how much more I keep adding to this project. But as of right now there are a few goals I plan to reach.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Add new missions in between waves</li><li>Complete enemy Ai</li><li>Complete Friendly Ai\u00a0</li><li>Split screen co-op &amp; pvp</li><li>at least 2 or 3 good levels</li></ul>\n<p>Feel free to let me know any problems you might have bugs or gameplay in the comments. Let me know if you would like a better form of communication (A discord perhaps). No clue how people will react to this game but I may as well put it out there so I can get some feedback. Hope you enjoy it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T05:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/760d65ea71b6fff1d012e1cf2be17d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MasterDraterra"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
