This was my first time creating a multiplayer game, so I kept things simple. Players can choose their nickname and then easily hop into or create a new server in order to compete with each other in a sandbox free-for-all. It can get very chaotic, but in a good way.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>It was fun to try something new, both in terms of gameplay and graphical style. I would have liked to add in actual timed-matches, but had trouble figuring it out due to still being new to multiplayer development. Still, I'm very proud of the project and think it turned out fun. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>=CREDITS=</strong><br/><strong>Music: </strong>ElectroTV \r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>=SOURCE=</strong><br/>https://github.com/GoggledPetilil/PolyGUN<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:21:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4aaf748e75f30990654126319dab7b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peti"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
