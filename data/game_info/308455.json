Instead of using traditional health points or lives, you must collect food to survive, as every movement you make costs 1 food. How far in the cave can you make it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also inspired by Choose Your Own Adventure games, and every choice you make could impact the rest of the game permanently. So, choose wisely!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only a prototype because the graphics and music are from a Unity tutorial for a roguelike game (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial), which this game was built off and inspired by.\u00a0\u00a0Check it out if you\u2019re interested in making your own game. Additionally, this prototype does not have some features that will\u00a0be included in the future demo.
