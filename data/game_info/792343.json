It's written in C# without the use of a game engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an ASCII art game that runs in the terminal. For windows it runs in fullscreen and there is sound in game. Linux and MacOS users will have to maximize screen in order to be able to play the game. Otherwise it will crash due to 'IndexOut OfBounds'. I could not get sound working for linux and mac users due to it running in terminal</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my little game!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T12:33:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbf/cbfea78273e97d45a0beb37024f0da21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["indievic"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
