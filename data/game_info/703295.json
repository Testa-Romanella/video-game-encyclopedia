Long teeth,  unnatural thirst, and a sluggishness during the day. Someone did this to  them. But who, and why?<br/><br/>Try to solve the mystery of what happened that night, and who are they changing  into.<br/><br/>During the story, both Jesse and Rachel will be able to romance one of the following characters:<br/>-    Tristan, who runs the bar Nightshade and almost never go out during the day<br/>-    Valerie, Tristan's sister and sexy bartender who isn't afraid of anything<br/>-    Nathan, an ex-student of medicine who can commune with the spirit world<br/>-    Zoe, apparently a regular librarian, in reality she has lived multiple lives<br/>-    Kasumi, a media savvy girl who can adapt to any situation<br/><br/>Each love interest can be equally romanced by Rachel or Jesse, but each path is unique.<br/><br/>You'll  also encounter again some familiar faces from Love Bites as secondary  characters, with various cameos and references.
