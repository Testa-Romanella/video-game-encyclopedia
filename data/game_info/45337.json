Solve challenging quests together with your friends and earn unique rewards. Collect precious raw goods and craft useful items. Enchant your gear to make it even stronger. Enhance your character and learn specialized abilities. Help the villagers and grow their homeland. Find hidden treasures and reveal their secrets.About us<br/>We are a team of three developers and work on qb in our freetime. It was only a small project at first which was meant for trying out new things. But once more and more features were added we decided to share qb with other players. In the current state of the game not all features are implemented and before we add more features it is better to get feedback from other players first. We would like to point out that current features and functions still contain bugs which can crash the game. With the start of the Early Access phase we might be able to employ more people to help and support us working on the game.Features<br/>\u2605 Quest system (static, dynamic and Coop quests)<br/>\u2605 Skill system for your very own character progression<br/>\u2605 Dynamically generated villages with quests<br/>\u2605 Furnitures<br/>\u2605 Save and load prefabs ingame and share it via Steam Workshop<br/>\u2605 Ghost preview before placing prefabs<br/>\u2605 Over 100 block types with HD quality textures<br/>\u2605 Over 10 different variations of block shapes<br/>\u2605 20 different enemy types<br/>\u2605 25 realistic biomes (based on real world climate biomes)<br/>\u2605 Easy switching between block shapes via pie menu<br/>\u2605 Treasure chests<br/>\u2605 Lockpicking<br/>\u2605 Customizable and placeable particle emitters<br/>\u2605 Brew your very own beer and craft other delicious sweets<br/>\u2605 Realistic day and night cycles<br/>\u2605 Flowing water simulation<br/>\u2605 Minimap and large map ingame<br/>\u2605 Depending of skill choices you can become a warrior, mage, archer or all in one<br/>\u2605 Combine cloth, leather and plate armor pieces<br/>\u2605 Easy to use crafting system with 9 different crafting stations<br/>\u2605 Enchanting of weapons and equipment<br/>\u2605 Magical potions<br/>\u2605 Combat with one and two handed swords, bows and staffs<br/>\u2605 Dynamic lights<br/>\u2605 Caves with marvelous ores<br/>\u2605 Old school Ascii-Shader for the nerds<br/>\u2605 Simple farming<br/>\u2605 Additional translations for other languagesFuture plans<br/>\u2605 Better network code<br/>\u2605 More and new types of quests<br/>\u2605 Riding system and fly mounts<br/>\u2605 Virtual Reality support<br/>\u2605 Character shape customization<br/>\u2605 Water pressure simulation<br/>\u2605 Weather system<br/>\u2605 More enemy types<br/>\u2605 Carrying one weapon in each hand<br/>\u2605 Reputation system<br/>\u2605 Other races of humanoids<br/>\u2605 Transport system to transfer goods from one place to another<br/>\u2605 Fast travel system<br/>\u2605 Stationery &amp; automated weapons<br/>\u2605 Larger view distance by using generated terrain<br/>\u2605 placing buildings/prefabs from iso-3D-perspective<br/>\u2605 Enhanced AI with changing routines and schedules based on day/night cycle<br/>\u2605 Different game modes other than survival<br/>\u2605 Mod support<br/>\u2605 Linux support<br/><br/>Credits: Trailer music provided by \"alxd\" can be found on SoundCloud under the alias \"alxdmusic\".", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/4513266f62a055132b5337153980d516.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Qb-337076850010835/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Armadillo Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Armadillo Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
