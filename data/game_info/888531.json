Rather than being a fair fight, the prototype consists of a boss battle, with inspirations from bullet hell style games with a large health pool for the enemy and one life for the player. Try to duck and weave through the enemy\u00a0 bullets, seize the opportunity of the cooldown between\u00a0enemy's bullet\u00a0burst fire, and destroy the enemy before they destroy you.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Arrow - Moves Player Ship Left</p>\n<p>Right Arrow\u00a0- Moves Player Ship Right</p>\n<p>P - Pauses the game</p>\n\n<p>Created by:\u00a0Estella Pham, 217277229</p>\n<p>Additional Credits:</p>\n<p>Love2D (Game Engine):\u00a0https://love2d.org/</p>\n<p>Jsfxr (Used to create the explosion sound):\u00a0https://sfxr.me/</p>\n<p>BeepBox (Used to create the music):\u00a0https://www.beepbox.co</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd29d442675b4889efa9792acd66284c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arcboom"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
