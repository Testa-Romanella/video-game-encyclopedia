Humans threw the pixies down a hole centuries ago, and built a labyrinth to keep them trapped down there. It is your task to traverse the dangers of the labyrinth in search of a cure, while navigating a power struggle between the two dungeon guardians, the rude but logical Error, and the helpful but wishy-washy Scrawl. Hopefully, a cure awaits you on the surface. But is there even a surface anymore?</p>\n<p>Get to the bottom (or is it the top?) of the mystery and find a cure for your kind in Keep Looking Up!</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game uses Windows Error Messages to convey story!
