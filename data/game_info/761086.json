During 5 minutes, you can try to get the highest score. You get points when a new track part is created, so the more you drive, the more you get points. But beware of falling, if you do so, you will restart from the begining and will have to do all the road until the part you felt. Howerver, you\u00a0 have checkpoints, if you think you are going to fall of the road, you can press C and hope to stay on the road. The game is still in development, and I'm working to suppress the remaining bugs, add sounds, new cars,\u00a0 and new track parts if you like the game.</p>\n<p>I hope you'ill enjoy this demo !</p>\n<p>Antho331</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T07:29:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb1/fb199f89ab27fd78846de87f8828b0b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Antho331"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
