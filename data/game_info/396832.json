{"id": 396832, "slug": "package-chat", "name": "Package Chat", "name_original": "Package Chat", "description": "<p>Content Warning: Medical stuff, claustrophobia, swearing?<br/></p>\n\n<p>This is an incredibly amateur Kinetic Novel made for Yuri Game Jam 2019.</p>\n<p>Package Chat is about a ship traveling in space in the future. The protagonist is a passenger, confined to a small space where she spends her time in virtual reality. It's boring, lonely, and a really poor fit for her. However, her tedium changes when someone sends her a message.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is supposed to be an introspective story about two girls in a strange sci-fi situation. I had the idea when a couple of years back I was getting an MRI scan and my only company in the machine was a woman's voice in my earbuds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm a horrible amateur at using any sort of game creation software, so I apologize in advance for this game's quality. The music is from Jason Shaw on Audionautix.com. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T05:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/777/777ab7862767a133c8c84c557725feb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["punishedhag"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
