I enjoyed working with it a lot, and was surprised at how much I was able to accomplish with the engine even while being completely new to it. All graphics were made over the course of the weekend using Inkscape for the vector drawings, and Blender to model the unicorns and then render them as tiny 2D sprites.</p>\n<p><strong>Other background:</strong></p>\n<p>Since I was planning to use an engine I was unfamiliar with, I entered this jam with the plan of making something simple that my daughters (ages 4 and 7) would be able to play and enjoy \u2013 they\u2019ve been slightly obsessed with unicorns (which they say hatch from eggs), and also slime, so that became the subject matter for my submission. Hopefully it can provide a few minutes of entertainment for adults as well :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/2106d67fea2ae478ebeb518fa5a8e87e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["devharts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
