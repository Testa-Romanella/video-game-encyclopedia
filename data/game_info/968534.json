Based on the legends and myths of the Inca and Tiwanaku cultures that were located in present-day Peru and Bolivia.<h3>Myths and legends behind the video game</h3>The game represents the eternal fight between light and darkness that exists in all cultures of the world. In the world of the Incas, the champion of light is the great God Wiraqocha. This God usually works accompanied by his minor gods known as Auquis. Wiraqocha and his Auquis protect the light of the sun, a light that helps life develop and drives away evil spirits of the night. The Auquis, whom humans frequently saw on earth, were represented in multiple ways in the astronomical calendar of Nazca, known as The Nazca Lines, that great astral calendar located in southern Peru.<br/><br/>The darkness was the territories of the great Gods Yana\u00f1amca and Tuta\u00f1amca, lords of darkness and night as they were known in ancient Inca legends. These great Gods are Wiraqocha's enemies not only on Earth but throughout our multiverse and their fight has cosmic dimensions.<br/><br/>Old legends say that when man appeared on Earth, our planet was still a cold and dark place and the forces of light and darkness were in constant conflict. One day, the great God Wiraqocha appeared in the Andes and illuminated the skies with sunlight. In the Tiwanaku region, The Great Gate of the Sun was created, a dimensional portal for the gods that the inhabitants used as a place of veneration when the first rays of light that the God Wiraqocha offered to the world arrived.<br/><br/>However, in the heavens there is still a great rivalry between light and darkness. For this reason, the God Wiraqocha had to head to other dimensions to keep the light victorious. The evil gods Yana\u00f1amca and Tuta\u00f1amca, Wiraqocha's great enemies, took the opportunity to take revenge by stealing the suns of the Milky Way. They both stole all the suns in our galaxy, leaving our world, Earth, in deep darkness. Both gods are represented by the two most dangerous creatures of the Andes: the Puma, the big cat of the Andes that is characterized by its strength, and the great snake Amaru, the anaconda of the Andes. These demons roamed the Earth and other living worlds to prevent either the local residents or the Auquis from being able to recover the suns.<br/><br/>The darkness had no end and men prayed to the Great God Wiraqocha for help, hoping that he would not let life on earth wither. Wiraqocha took pity on the men and sent the Auquis to him. The Great God Wiraqocha sent them with the mission to rescue the stolen suns to prevent life from withering on Earth and the other worlds that could be accessed through the Great Gate of the Sun.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-30T02:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/baa/baa9a55af53d089f050a1b5b889a5970.jpg", "website": "https://sunsofwiraqocha.netdreams.pe/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adrian Blume", "Rafael Gonzalez-Otoya B.", "Alejandro Medina"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Netdreams - Regob EIRL"], "esrb_rating": null}
