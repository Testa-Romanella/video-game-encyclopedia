Scan smaller creatures in the environment for parts</em></p>\n<p><em>2. Interact with the synthesis machine in certain rooms<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>3. Select a creature you scanned from the top row using the Interact button. A secondary cursor should stay on it if it's selected properly</em></p>\n<p><em>4. Select a slot of the new synthesis creature's body part. Moving the cursor all the way to the right or left will go to the cross, which has empty slots for each limb. When you hit the Interact button, it will change that slot to the scanned part you selected.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>5. Hit right on the D-Pad until you get to the Synthesize button, click Interact, and your new creation will synthesize!<br/></em><br/></p>\n<p>For GBJAM9 / GBCompo 21</p><p>If you're here from the GBCompo rather than GBJam, please check the github link below for the latest release (Rom file is in releases OR bin)!
