Requires Java to run!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>- Use the arrow keys to move. It's a ship, so you can't do a 180 degree turn!Fire your cannons at enemy ships to complete the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- You can only fire a cannon if it has been loaded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- You can buy upgrades from the shop menu, although it's pretty broken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- If the game breaks and you end up seeing the map and a level at the same time, you won! We ran out of time to program that part. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Paul Nadan (@superduperpacman42): Code</p>\n<p>Nate Sampo: Code, Interface</p>\n<p>Daniel Alhadeff: \"Code\", Level Design</p>\n<p>Nathaniel Tan: Art, Animation, Sound Effects</p>\n<p>Jeremy Ryan (@plasmastarfish): Art, Animation, Music</p>\n<p>Max Wei: Interface</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e208359be869054acff8e6e08c384d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["plasmastarfish", "superduperpacman42"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
