If there is a match of 3 and the level doesn't\u00a0detect the match, swipe on either of the pieces which are to be match and they will be matched.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:- Please walk and unlock the first 3 levels\u00a0 before choosing to play any of those levels. Your progress for the steps taken will be lost as soon as you click on either of the levels to play them.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a39/a39091322118faf3e86b6d9372e30dcc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Abhinavsaha"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
