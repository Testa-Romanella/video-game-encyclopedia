Just you, your ice cream truck, and hordes of children craving dairy and sugar. All you're doing is living it up a little, driving donuts in the local cul-de-sac as you deliver sweet treats on a summer day.<br/><br/>Wait. You just hit a kid with your truck.\u00a0You're losing money now. Here comes a lawsuit, oh god.<br/><br/>And yet the kids won't stop running at you. They don't care about you burning rubber like a pro, they will eat you alive. Quick, throw more ice cream at them! Make sure all the kids get their sugary treats all while managing your drift speed. Don't let them reach your truck in this rogue-like, first-person shooter, where even your arsenal of sweets can be out of control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*NOTE: This game is not complete.
