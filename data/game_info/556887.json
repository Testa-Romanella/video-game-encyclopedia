The game was made in the hope to raise awareness of the long-term and short term capital gain tax in the U.S. The game is fairly simple to play, and the only control you need is a mouse and the space bar. For more information about how to play or the tax bracket, you can access it in the in-game menu. I hope you enjoy the game :)</p><p>PS: Recommend playing this game on Firefox or another browser besides google chrome.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T07:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8df32a4f1b75f5c3d9bbc65c6cc18cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dangnguyen95"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
