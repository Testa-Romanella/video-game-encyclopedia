Left click and hold on asteroids to fire your grapple gun at them, which will reel you in. Don\u2019t let it reel you in all the way, though! If you collide with asteroids they will damage your space suit (its durability is shown in the bottom left corner, and you will lose when it reaches zero). You will have to make your next move quickly when grappling, and find the next asteroid to grapple to before you collide with an asteroid on your current trajectory. In a pinch, you can hold down space to use your thruster to propel you in the direction you are facing. Use it conservatively though, since fuel is limited (shown in bottom right corner). If your suit is taking damage, you can grapple to a blue medical canister to reel it in towards you and repair your suit. The goal of this level and of each subsequent level is to reach the glowing portal at the end of the asteroid field, which the arrow at the top of the UI will guide you towards. You can grapple to the portal to reel in towards it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next level is more challenging, because there are more asteroids in your way and there is a black hole behind you. The black hole is constantly expanding, and if it gets too close you will hear its hum and it will pull you in towards it. If it pulls you all the way to the center before you can escape you will die. You will also have to get better at controlling your grapple gun and thruster on this level, since the asteroid field is more dense.</p>\n<p>The final level is the main event. Here you will find enemy aliens who will shoot homing laser bullets at you (which damage your suit) if you get too close. You can kill these enemies by grappling them towards you, holding the grapple down to reel them in all the way, and when they are fully reeled in, right click to slice them with your space katana (while still holding the left mouse button so they can\u2019t escape).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:29:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chuckstein"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
