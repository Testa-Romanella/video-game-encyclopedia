Riot police and the military were positioned on the exits of the city in a hope that they would stop anything, including the virus, from leaving the city, however it was no use as within a few short hours the sheer number of the infected coupled with their outrageous strength overpowered the lines of defense and set about to spread the virus further into the heart of america. </p><p>Within a day the entire state had been overrun, a week later the whole of America had fallen to the infected, and the virus was starting to advance into neighboring countries. Other countries from around the world started to fear for mankind's survival and in a desperate last-ditch attempt to wipe out the infection they nuked most of the United States leaving it a desolate wasteland. 100 years later not much is known of what happened after the nukes fell, other than the fact it did not stop the relentless infected and only made those who survived the blast stronger through mutation. </p><br/>As the tribute you are part of one of the only known surviving communities of humans, who send one person a year out into wilderness in a hope of coming into contact with other living life. So far 99 tributes have left the safe haven, and 99 have failed to return, will you be the tribute to change this?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9a74f79ebce690877512a9862efc2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuinnandWin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
