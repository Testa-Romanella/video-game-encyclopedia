The controls are relatively the same and can be found in the how to play section of the game (accessible\u00a0through the main menu).\u00a0 Every player begins at level 1 and can increase their level by clearing lines. For every 5 lines cleared\u00a0 the player's level is increased by 1 until they reach level 20. With every increase in level, there is a slight increase in game speed, and the number of points rewarded for clearing a line is also increased.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Please inform me if there are any bugs or issues with the game, or if you have any suggestions you would like to make :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/689/6893e4fe86d35044fb9b3f6d1bee2293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArtinMolaeiForouhar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
