Be the first to grow to size 7 and touch the door in the centre of the screen. Shooting shrinks you, but shooting your opponent shrinks them and grows you.</p><p>The game is pretty unbalanced, as it stands, but there's something in the core of the game that has potential. I'm pleased with it as the result of an eight hour jam.</p><p>Owen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43b351ae7244008b92c7a0ab787eb01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owen Goss"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
