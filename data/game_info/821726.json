Use your gold and wit to design the perfect trio of dice to defeat goblins and earn more gold!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>\n<p>While in the Shoppe, use your gold points to upgrade the six sides of your speed, block, and attack dice. When it comes to combat, each turn begins with rolling your speed dice to discover who attacks first (in a tie, you go first). Damage is then calculated by subtracting the defender's block die from the attacker's attack die. If the dice are equal then the attacker deals 1 damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Tryston Minsquero</p>\n<p>Programmers: Kameron Thrasher &amp; Maurice Sanders</p>\n<p>Game Design: Michael Bettes</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Design: Kameron Thrasher</p>\n<p>Character Design and Animation:\u00a0Jana Rowe</p>\n<p>UI, Background Art, and Sound Effects: Pauline Le</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All\u00a0<strong>assets were made during the jam.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong>\u00a0Unity, Photoshop, Bosca Ceoil, sfxr, Audacity\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code:</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/Michbet/GMTK-2022<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d5/0d59cce7ff3bb5afdb150114d46431fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tryston", "ktrash", "Michbet", "apaull0", "Jana", "mauriceglynn1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
