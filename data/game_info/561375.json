But your messengers have given warning a nearby kingdom are getting jealous.<br/>The game begins as you are on one of your regular strolls through the forest, visiting your villages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jon</strong> - Team Leader, Architecture Lead, Designer</p>\n<p>This is only my second game jam but I'm so pleased to be working with a team this time. I played the role of supervisor and lead architect. I hope people have a good time playing this game and really get immersed in the experience (even with the rough edges!)</p>\n<p><strong>Adam</strong> - Lead Programmer, FX Lead\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the gear no idea. Only my second time using Unity and my first time with some to help me understand what I'm doing. Did have one attempt at the Global Game Jam in the past but it didn't go well.</p>\n<p><strong>Zoe</strong> - Level Design, Composition and Programming</p>\n<p>This is my first time making a game, using unity and doing a game jam! I\u2019ve had such a good time working with these guys on this project and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sarah</strong> - Sound Design, Asset Creation and Testing</p>\n<p>I made some silly noises into a microphone I'm not sure I really deserve this much credit!</p>\n<p><strong>INFOMATION</strong></p>\n<p>Hi everyone! we managed to get something done in time! It's not polished but its 100% playable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We used a lot of paid assets for this as none of the team are artists. We used the time instead programming functionality and laying out the world.</p>\n<p>Obviously we're sorry that there is no title screen and no \"YOU WON!\" screen but we didn't prioritise those over the mechanics of the game and the feel of playing.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>LStick or WASD to move</p>\n<p>RStick or Mouse to look around</p>\n<p>LB or '\\'\u00a0to summon</p>\n<p>LT or LShift to lock on to near enemy and cast shield</p>\n<p>RT or LMouse to throw a guy</p>\n<p>RB to or RMouse to charge!</p>\n<p>A button or LMouse to continue through dialogue</p>\n<p>Escape to exit game</p>\n<p>CONTROLLER RECOMMENDED</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Cartoon FX Remaster -\u00a0Version R 1.1.0 - February 11, 2021</p>\n<p>GUI PRO Kit - Casual Game -\u00a0Version 1.3.4 - February 08, 2021</p>\n<p>Little Heroes Mega Pack -\u00a0Version 2.9 - January 05, 2021</p>\n<p>POLYGON - Knights Pack -\u00a0Version 1.2 - January 21, 2021</p>\n<p>Ultimate Sound FX Bundle -\u00a0Version 1.0 - July 13, 2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:59:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/667/66731734d8c8e79bd00bd2339c99f99a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmoothTrooper"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
