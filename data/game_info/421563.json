How spooky would that be?<br/></p>\n<p>Gather round the campfire for a series of intertwined short stories depicting encounters with a perfectly normal bear at a perfectly normal cabin. There are 19 endings for 19 campers and many ways to react to catching a glimpse of this majestic beast. Do you want to practice good wildlife etiquette? Or are you gonna reach over and give this giant predator pets like a big puppy? You choose your personal level of survival instinct!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c44ee98de88f40ecbe8894062d715a68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Very Worst Thing"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
