{"id": 980575, "slug": "milfs-plaza", "name": "MILF's Plaza", "name_original": "MILF's Plaza", "description": "<strong>The plot tells the story of a carefree adventurer from the big city.</strong><br/>Donald, a simple guy full of ambition and thirsty for thrills, gets into trouble with the local criminal world. Because of his desire to make easy money by cheating at cards Donald is in dangerous situation - he is caught red-handed. The only thing he has earned is an insurmountable amount of debt. He has to pay back the sum in practically no time, with nowhere to run.<br/><br/>The day before, the protagonist's brother, a national security agent, asks Donald to look after his wife for the duration of his business trip. Donald is ashamed to admit his problems, and it is even more difficult to live up to his brother's authority. But he agrees, which only aggravates the situation. Despair and fear are suddenly replaced by lust and passion. Mary, his brother's wife, turns out to be the only ray of light in the protagonist's impenetrable nightmare. He falls in love with her, and then with his neighbour Christie, who becomes the catalyst for his new outlook on life.<br/><br/>The protagonist also encounters other women on his path, each contributing to both the story and Donald's worldview.<br/><br/><h3>\u2605 Dynamic narrative \u2605</h3>The plot is intended to enthrall and entertain. The dialogues are full of irony and references, and the scenes themselves are short and varied. All this is framed in a marvellous art style with plenty of emotional sprites, art inserts, animation and mini-games. An interactive novel in all its glory.<h3>\u2605 Charming characters \u2605</h3>The game is abundant with female characters, most of whom you can have a short or full-fledged romance with, drowning in the number of intimate scenes. Mary and Christie are the main characters, the completion of whose story not only doesn't end the game, but also unlocks new content: additional events, characters, quests and costumes.<br/><br/><h3>\u2605 Animation \u2605</h3>The game contains frame-by-frame animation, the look of which is exceptionally pleasing and impressive. Earlier scenes are made a bit simpler, or even with elements of rigging, which we would like to believe you will be just as pleasantly surprised by, as the visuals are still good.<h3>\u2605 Sandbox \u2605</h3>The gameplay has virtually no restrictions on your freedom of action and movement. With few exceptions, you are free to have affairs with whomever and whenever you want. For those who are particularly tempted by the genre, there is a \"Survival\" mode in the game, in which you need to sleep, eat and rest. And in general, it makes the gameplay more diverse and immerses you in the world of beautiful maidens.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T07:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ce72f33f79efbfe62fb416b13eba2ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Texic"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["TopHouse Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
