The evil and cruel King Revelant invaded this world. Take part in the battles for the liberation of that world as part of the Union of Kings. Gather your army, learn how to use combat cards, increase the level of warriors and defeat Revelant in an epic battle, bringing peace to the lands of Phantor. Do the experiments with cards and collect the battle deck that is suitable for you. Archmage Niriton conjured the spirit of a warrior or magic with its own characteristics in each card, by knowing which you can improve their strengths or weaknesses. Before you face with Revelant, you must defeat his powerful supporters, putting and conjuring their souls in cards. At the same time, Revelant\u2019s supporters are can challenge you to battle at any time using the \u201cBlack Mark\u201d in an attempt to ruin your castle ... <br/><strong>  The full version of the Legends of the world Phantor you will find in the book \"History\" on the main table in your castle in the game.  </strong><h3> The mechanics of the game </h3> You appear in the throne room of your castle in the game and, moving between tables, you can set up your battle deck, buy new cards and improve existing cards for coins received from victories in battles.<br/>In battle, you appear on the tower of your castle. Take your cards and throw them on the battlefield. At the place where the card falls, a warrior appears who will attack the enemy\u2019s tower or the nearest enemy himself. The range of the card\u2019s flight depends on the power of your throw. The further the warrior appears from the card, the longer the reanimator will fly to revive him.<br/>When enemy warriors are coming you can shoot at them from a bow, making damage. Besides you, your side towers of the Princess shoot at enemy warriors too.<br/>You need to destroy the central tower of the enemy to win the battle. Your warriors will attack it only after the destruction of the side towers. If the battle time is up, and the score is equal, you are given an extra time with accelerated energy production from the card reanimator, at the end of which you need to destroy the enemy\u2019s towers. If time ends, and the score is equal, the defeat is scored to one whose towers\u2019 health is less.<h3> The development of the game </h3><ul><li>adding new cards;<br/></li><li>adding historical battles with the supporters of Revelant;<br/></li><li>game optimization;<br/></li><li>adding of multiplayer;<br/></li><li>improving the level of the game;<br/></li><li>adding customization of the castle and the character;<br/></li><li>work on game reviews and bugs.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5e/a5ee6d0556bc0282783454d6ffcdedce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 442, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aviahel"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aviahel group"], "esrb_rating": null}
