The Project should serve as a vertical slice of a potentially bigger game. In this slice, we wanted to explore a dynamic narrative experience and create an atmospheric and rich environment.</p>\n<p>For the creation of the game we are very thankful for the support of Luca Langenberg, Prof. Thomas Bremer and Prof. Susanne Brandhorst at the DE:HIVE institute.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:17:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd616d1d706f42cb0b29ea4d531fc53f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johannes Witt", "Mitha", "loumigames", "ocri0808", "cmDKeen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
