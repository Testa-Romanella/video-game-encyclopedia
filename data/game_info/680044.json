{"id": 680044, "slug": "come-home-3", "name": "Come Home", "name_original": "Come Home", "description": "<p>When your father goes missing, you return home from studying abroad to help uncover clues to where he could have gone. But returning to your hometown brings back a lot of old feelings and you soon find yourself meeting new people and rekindling relationships with old friends as well. How are you supposed to focus on finding your father, when there are so many other interesting characters who all want your attention as well. You can&#39;t just let love pass you by. Your father would understand.<br />\nCome Home has 20 romanceable characters, each with their own individual storyline. All romances are optional, so you can pick and choose the characters you like, ignoring the ones that you don&#39;t. None of the romance paths are required to play through the main story. You decide how you spend your day, from focusing on schoolwork, to dating, to just hanging around the park or playing games on your computer. An in-game hint system is there for you if you get stuck, making walkthroughs unnecessary.<br />\nThis is an adult game and there is a lot of sex in it. There are many scenes that will happen throughout the story, along with repeatable activities with the many characters in the game. All scenes are fully rendered and there are plenty of animations as well. Plus, any time that you&#39;d like to see a scene again, you can replay the scene in its entirety from the gallery.<br />\nThere are so many interesting characters waiting for you. All you need to do is Come Home.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T17:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e5b749589cc80daffba66f25d6d4ab.jpg", "website": "https://rjrhodeswrites.com/", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 175, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 3, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["R.J.
