You charge cells to claim them and if a cell is fully charged it will spread, launching a combo and taking over connected cells. Win the game by taking over all of your opponents\u2019 charges. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>You make the rules! Spread: Transmission is capturing the whimsical magic of house rules. Switch up the game at any time with \u201cLabs\u201d, a series of game modes that can be mixed and experimented with to craft beautiful and unique playing experiences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Want to change the game up with boxes?
