Literally. You use the KickBack shotgun to reach the end of the level in a death run style game where every death increases your speed and jump creating interesting levels and making you have to try the level slightly differently\u00a0until you reach max speed.<br/></p>\n<p>If you are reading this I recommend you try out the game I find it a lot of fun to play and had a lot of fun making it. This has been my first game jam and I would like to\u00a0thank Jonas for hosting it and I hope you try it and thanks to every one else who tries it. If your interested in seeing more updates on the game and other game dev content follow me on instagram @gadd.games</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da678fd409c1df9d40a6548e31615cd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gadd420"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
