The problem is, they are scattered all over the place. Using Santas powers, you can collect presents from different locations at the same time.</p>\n<p>Move around with WAD or the arrow keys. You can click between the opened popups to take control of Santa.</p>\n<p>There are 6 levels in total, and by the end, you will be playing all of them at the same time. Each level you complete helps you complete the next, as Santa can exist in the same position across each level window.<br/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit hard to describe, so just have a go playing it!</p>\n<p><strong>*NOTES*</strong></p>\n<p>This game uses popup windows to play the game in. Each level is a different popup that you play in at the same time. You might get a popup blocker warning, and it\u2019d be great if you allow popups for the domain while playing, otherwise the game doesnt work!</p>\n<p>Its\u2019 been found that Christmas Present struggles to run on a secondary monitor due to how the popup positioning works, so make sure you play it on your main monitor!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d557ba5d9bfb8a0a81ba85b20f0b12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jon Reid"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
