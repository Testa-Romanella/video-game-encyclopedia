The game, made by AgeofGames (known at the time as PMStudios Italia) should therefore be considered an Artifact, a piece of the Independent Videogame Archeology from the beginning of the millennium. The proprietary engine, developed by a single programmer, was imperfect back then, and likewise right now, as hardware configurations have swiftly evolved.<br/><br/><strong>Players should also note that the game cannot be saved until the first level is completed.</strong> The first level takes between 15 to 45 minutes to complete, depending on skill and the amount of each player\u2019s interaction with the enemies in the map.<br/><br/> Some antivirus systems may also block the game altogether. Not being able to update the code in the engine in any way, we will not be able to solve the problems that will be reported to us.<br/><br/>We remind you that <strong>you can easily request a refund here on steam</strong>. If you are one of the 30% of folks who will not be able to run the game, please request a refund within 2 hours of gameplay, as unfortunately the game may continue to crash.<br/><br/>One thing we did manage to fix was the English dialogue (only dialogue not Etrom\u2019s journal unfortunately), which has been overhauled by the award winning science fiction writers of the CyberScrivens collective.<br/><br/>We have decided to republish Etrom at a symbolic price despite all these problems because we believe that the setting and the overall narrative structures of the project are still very valid and fascinating today and we hope, also thanks to the addition of a free extract of the novel, that new and old players can immerse themselves for a few hours in this parallel universe that we want to be able to expand in the future with modern technology and development programs.<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363700/Eukarion_Tales_2/<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T19:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/99587bb314f0aa913d08926f72846c78.jpg", "website": "https://www.ageofgames.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AgeOfGames"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AgeOfGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
