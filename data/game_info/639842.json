{"id": 639842, "slug": "askaria-the-decay", "name": "Askaria: The Decay", "name_original": "Askaria: The Decay", "description": "<p>The realm of Eneia is under assault by a deadly disease. The Decay. No one knows where it came from. It begins with a dark mark on the skin that slowly spreads like a spider web until the body has been consumed and forever changed. Those fallen prey to the Decay and turned, are known as the Forlorn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no known cure. But there are tales. Stories of a man who was once able to cure the Decay when it first came to Eneia. It is in these tales that many of the people in the Kingdom take heart. If he did exist then surely there is hope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current king of Askaria has put his hope in such tales as he sends out a call all across Eneia in search of anyone willing to answer him. The King tasks those brave enough, to search Eneia for the Forgotten Prince, or anything that might lead to a cure for the Decay.</p>\n<p>It is a stretch, falling on fairy tales to lead the way. But it is all they have left. And there might be more to the fairy tales, if one looks hard enough.</p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my little project! My name is Siryn and I'm very excited to be working on this. When I saw RPG Maker on steam a few years ago, I put it in my wish-list thinking, hey that's kind of cool. And forgot about it.</p>\n<p>Then, I suffered a work injury 3 years ago that's kept me from returning to a normal life. It's been a grueling few years for me and not just with the current pandemic. As a mom of a three year old and not being able to walk around as well anymore, things have been challenging to say the least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When I saw the Game Jam for Reach for the Stars, I knew I had to do it. I started this project with a little over 2 weeks left on the deadline for Game Jam: Reach for the Stars. I know nothing about making games, I'm not a coder by any means, and I'm still trying to figure out how to work variables... &gt;.&gt;</p>\n<p>But, I'm a writer. I've been writing for the better part of my life. I'm published with a handful of books out and still working away on a handful more. This particular idea has been with me for a very long time. I tried writing it, I only got so far though. I tried doing a roleplay with it (pen/paper - rpgGateway site) but it never got anywhere. So I held onto the idea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When this opportunity came, I knew exactly what I wanted to do for the game. Which is the idea I've kept for so long and couldn't put on paper. Yet now, the idea is flowing and coming together to create this RPG -\u00a0Askaria: The Decay.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've put my heart into this game and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed creating it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What is available is only a small part and there will be much more on the way as I continue to work on this project of mine and make a dream come true.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much, and happy gaming!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T09:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/617ad9d04b900e1192282fc12cd89e0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirynSueng"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
