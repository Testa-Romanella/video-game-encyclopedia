Chrome doesn't render the light effect around your character in the looting area. I developed the whole game with native JavaScript and CSS - Chrome seems to do CSS masking different than Firefox, and I missed that bug during my testings. Really sorry for the inconvinience! <br/></p>\n\n<p>During the \u00a0day you can let your characters collect resources, \u00a0craft buildings , read books and go fishing. The only thing that is \"dangerous\" during the day is the time running by - You must have all the important preparations done before winter arrives.</p>\n<p>At night one of your characters will travel to the next town to find loot. Some of it is highly valuable, so think twice before you throw loot into your stockpile box - you won't get it back once it is in there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You win the game as soon as you have completed all 4 buildings and when your stockpile is at 100%* To be able to build the buildings, you will have to find and read the books teaching you what \u00a0materials and tools you need (make sure to hold tools always in your hands when they are needed). To stockpile things, drag them into the wooden box**</p>\n<p>* There was not enough time to playtest the game properly. As it turns out, filling the stockpile takes ages as it is implemented now. Therefore, you can consider it a victory if you complete all 4 buildings on time. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>**Make sure \u00a0to not throw tools or rare materials (some are needed for building) or books (before you have read them) into the box. They won't spawn again.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game can only be played in Firefox browser. In Chrome the light effect in the looting area doesn't render which is ending in a completely dark screen.<br/></p><p>You can only keep one item of the same type in your inventory. When you drag a second one of the same type in your inventory, it will disappear. This is a particular problem when it comes to nails. \u00a0Two of them are needed to build the workbench. If you find more than one while looting, drag only one\u00a0 in your inventory - use it, and wait for the next night  to get the other one\u00a0 (it will still be there).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:48:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/585/5852c87b58512b79154d2934e0153a9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Humane Tiger"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
