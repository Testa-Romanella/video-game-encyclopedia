If you close the app and come back to it later, the state of the puzzle is automatically saved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With 4 immersive soundtracks, the app is very relaxing. At the same time, jigsaw puzzles are great in any age to keep your brain sharp and improve spatial cognition.</p>\n<p>All our games are completely free, have nothing locked, and don't ask for in-app purchases.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9f709e8c52b6af260e669bc7614f9af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Games For Girls O\u00dc"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
