An additional requirement was to add a hint system.</p><p>The way I made the hint system was to save all the states in the ideal solution as well as the all the players moves since the last ideal state of the game.  When the hint button is pressed the move given is the next ideal state if currently at an ideal state.  If not currently at an ideal state the game will undo the player's move until an ideal state is reached.</p><p>Game by Carlo Albino</p><p>Assets by kenney.nl</p><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/CarloAlbino/TowersOfHanoi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed4/ed40ebdb4d2b20aab5033f5e5fad3071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Carlo Albino"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
