USE THE \"P\" KEY TO INCREASE THE SCREEN SIZE AND \"O\" TO DECREASE IT.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Something I threw together for the demake jam of 2018. Actually got a lot of pixel animations done for the characters and laid out a lot of stuff, but didn't plan things well and ended up trying to code up everything on the last day of the jam which never turns out well lol Pretty much everything is unfinished/ unpolished so let me know if you run into any issues and I'll try to fix them in the future.</p>\n<p>Anyway it's a really brief concept demo. You can select your character ( Amazon is the only available one). Walk, jump, hit an orc, and that's pretty much it. The Amazon's \"Berserk\" system is currently in the game so the more you hit the orc the faster you will start to move. The orc can be killed, but he has a lot of HP haha</p><p>\u00a0I might expand on this later if I get the time, but this was a fun learning experiment that will help me out a lot in my future projects.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Walk: Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Jump: Z ( hold longer for higher jump)</p>\n<p>Attack: X</p>\n<p>O: decrease screen size</p>\n<p>P: increase screen size</p>\n<p>Music: T.M BACH and Bayaba</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d0/9d0423769abe0c94f7600c3da4a425fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CountMoxi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
