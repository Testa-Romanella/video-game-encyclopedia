The problem is that Puck cannot walk, he can only jump.

Fixed an issue with the HTML5 version where Puck would double jump while holding the jump button. It seems to be an issue with GameMaker and I had to use a workaround so please let me know if it still happens.\u00a0\u00a0I've also fixed a part where you'd die by just jumping on a bounce block.</p>\n<p><strong>1.0:</strong>\u00a0Initial release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/915/91502354bdcde1df9e69559248601b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Mors"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
