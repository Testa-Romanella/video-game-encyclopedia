The game randomly generates prompts that you then turn into passages that you write. The game gives you a framework and structure with some rules, but then the rest is up to you.</p><p>Here's an example of a Hero the game might generate for you:\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Type - Magic sword<br/> </li><li>Nature - Brave<br/> </li><li>Motivation - Revenge<br/> </li><li>Strength - Intuition<br/> </li><li>Flaw - Pride<br/> </li><li>Look - Outsider<br/> </li></ul>\n<p>From this prompt, the player figures out what the character of a proud and brave magic sword bent on revenge is, and writes it up in a short description. The\u00a0arc of the story develops as the game asks you to write more passages, pushing the story in different directions. It's mechanically simple, with much of the focus on the player narratively deciding what seems appropriate to happen, with the game presenting unexpected information to complicate things.</p>\n<p>Once you finish a story, you can export it as a HTML file containing all the passages you've gone through, so you can keep it for posterity and even share it online.\u00a0<strong>Note</strong> that on Android, you need to find the files using a file browsing app because I don't yet have elegant file handling for Android exports.</p>\n<p>This game is currently still in Beta, so there's more functionality to be added, bug fixes, UI improvements and prompt writing to be done.\u00a0However it is a working game and you can write complete stories in it, I've done several.\u00a0I can't confirm if the Mac and Linux builds work fully as I\u00a0don't have the means to test them personally.</p>\n<p>See the Google Doc below for further installation on how to set up, play and mod the game:<br/></p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZ01aSyp0j1WRNgqOQIi8xkH-r7Lo1P-cDu9CsWhUKo/...<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to get in contact with me if you have feedback, suggestions or stories you made and want to share:<br/>https://twitter.com/SuperBiasedMan<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74d/74d6a756055be1916ca13e0e6f454c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["SuperBiasedMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
