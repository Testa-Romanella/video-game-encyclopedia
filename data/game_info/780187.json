Player behaviour was recorded during gameplay to check if their engagement was higher on a system with Lootboxes or a system like an old ingame shop. This is the Lootbox Version. Gameplay will not change between the two types.</p>\n<p>There are some special blocks that will trigger an Effect upon destruction like:</p>\n<ul><li>Explosions! (Everyone loves them)</li><li>Multiple Balls (juggle them all!)</li><li>Random block destructions\u00a0 (MORE RNG!!!)</li><li>and even more (we can not spoil everything :P )</li></ul>\n<p>There are a total of 6 different Levels with 2 Themes. Game was developed by Mathias Bauer and Merih T\u00fcrkoglu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T09:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/38789ab329958cffcc6f26bf6627d986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Barlium", "IXionI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
