It's a parody of legitimate simulator games with a twisted storyline and satirical world.<br/><br/>After the events of Firefighter Simulator 2017, the Firefighter has moved on to a new city and a new fire department, hoping to be free from their past. But breaking free isn't so easy, and the new city is a mess of crime and corruption with an arsonist on the loose and a police force that doesn't care.<br/><br/>Who will you save, who will you burn, and who will you leave to their fate?<br/><br/>Firefighter VR+Touch features real-ish firefighting mechanics, a story of heroism and insanity, scathing satire mixed with cheap lowbrow comedy, moral choices that actually affect the ending, and NPCs that can be set on fire. It also offers Challenge Mode, where levels can be replayed to get efficiency stars and other achievements.<br/><br/>There are no ads or in-app purchases in this game.<br/><br/>Firefighter VR+Touch is compatible with the Cardboard and Daydream VR platforms. A controller is required for Cardboard; this game is compatible with most generic VR controllers, Bluetooth controllers, and USB controllers. It also has a non-VR mode that supports touch and gamepad controls.<br/><br/>This game is a work of parody. All characters, places, and scenarios are fictional or used in a fictional manner.
