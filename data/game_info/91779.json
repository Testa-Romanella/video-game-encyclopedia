Ancient Warfare 2</strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note: This is the prototype for my game in development.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can follow the development on my twitter account:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwitter<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can read the \r\n\t<strong>devblogs of Ancient Warfare 2</strong> on my website:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAncient Warfare 2 weekly devblog<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks for playing!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ancient Warfare<br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAncient Warfare is a minimalistic low poly ancient war game for Ludumdare 36 \"Ancient Technology\".\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou take control of a knight with sword and shield and try to kill all the red guys.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game features 3 different game modes:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Campaign</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t10 Levels to have some fun and kill red guys\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Endless</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t3 different difficulty settings. Enemies spawn faster with the time and you have to kill as many as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Custom Battle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can place the enemies like you want and try to beat them.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere are currently 7 different enemy types in game:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sword fighter</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA simple guy with a normal blade, medium dangerous.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mace fighter</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis guy will try to kill you with a mace, in groups and behind you, they are very dangerous\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Spear fighter</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTries to stay at range from the player, because his spear is long enough to hit him from away. This makes this troop quite difficult to handle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Archer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the name says, this guy has a bow and will try to sniper you from far distance. Better use your shield to protect from flying arrows.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unarmed</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis guy doesn't have any weapons and will just try to punch you. Large groups can make you lose the control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Knight</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis guy is like the player. He is equipped with a sword and a shield and has more hit points than the other units.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Spear thrower</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis unit will throw his spear at you and after that, he will try to punch you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWASD - Move\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLeft Mouse Button - Attack\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tRight Mouse Button - Shield\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tF12 - Screenshot\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Further work</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI created this game for a jam, so it hasn't much features.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf it gets good feedback, I might continue development or create a second part and replace animations through physics. I could also add friendly troops, so that you can let 2 teams fight against each other.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAnyway thanks for playing!
