But before you do that, you will have to make the planet livable for your plants. There are different ways to do that : dig and move your planets, find ressources, transfer them from one planet to another and balance energy in your solar system. <br/></p>\n<p>Each puzzle is made of a solar system in which you will find a seed on a planet that represents your goal. Your aim is to make that seed grow to his final stage. The plants have needs (ressources, temperature, other plants) that you have to fulfill in order to let them grow.</p>\n<p>This game was developed as a hobby project between 2014 and 2016. It has won the second place at \"Pitch My Game\" contest in Lyon, France. The game engine used is LibGDX.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T02:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/316/316d392f620f2cc9a0ea00b55f18cfc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Amaury Butaux"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
