One day a bad man uploads a virus which causes all your friends to turn against you. You are your friends' only hope. You must reach the control center and upload an antivirus. <br/></p>\n<p>Hurting your friends will make you a very sad robot however you need to do it to get energy from them and complete your mission. Can you balance your sadness and your need for juice? Only you can answer that question.</p>\n<p>This game was made in less than 3 hours for the Trijam #14 - 3 hours jam (that's why it looks so interesting and the balancing is out of whack).
