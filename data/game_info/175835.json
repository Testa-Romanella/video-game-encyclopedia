A sample game? </p><p>Yes! In this initial showing of Dusty Tome's game house, you play your everyday, average RPG hero; a young man with an epic destiny and nothing better to do with a sunny evening. You can experience this hero's tale as told by three snarky narrators who guide you through the ins and outs of playing an RPG, all the while moving to confront a great and prophesied evil that threatens to sit there and wait until you get around to it! </p><p>Yea RPG boasts nearly an hour of gameplay, easter eggs, stuffed teddy bears, RPG references, and a goth girl. Don't wait! Adventure calls!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/931/931137bd04f7abe8febb40281a96696b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dusty Tome"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
