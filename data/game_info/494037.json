What we grew up knowing about our mothers was really just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team was especially drawn to the concept of unconventional motherhood, and how completely human mothers are behind the mask of table-setting and finger-wagging. We wanted to tell a story about a mother who feels closer to the mxthers we may be one day; one whose stories from childhood to adulthood swell with turbulence, apprehension, and doubt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We asked ourselves, if we were to write a letter to our future child today, what would it sound like? And we started there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The topics explored in our point-and-click narrative adventure game are childhood, coming out and rejection, depression and isolation, and finally, the finding of one's own home/community.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy our game, and huge thanks to <strong>Side Quest</strong> + <strong>Sledgehammer\u2019s Women in Games</strong> Game Jam for inspiring us to bring this story to life!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1cb581f353da1d4dd839c40e494016.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shaynanigans", "Casey Ramos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
