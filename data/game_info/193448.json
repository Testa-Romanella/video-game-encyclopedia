Held at the Ict gamejam event placed in Wichita ks Butler Community College. This game ( Warp Phantasm ) was made in flash action script 2 in 2 days. This is not fully finished so be aware that this game is very quick and has a little coding added to it. Few things can't work which is choose your own decision, The only thing you can do is Click the arrow buttons and do the maze. To me this is a Prototype game and features may be added to the future or it might be a whole new different game. Side note: There is NO MUSIC REPEAT NO MUSIC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd573197c574a6fb079a5f13f9408c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YahwehsServant"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
