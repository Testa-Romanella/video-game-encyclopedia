Sides to change lanes, down to shoot.\u00a0The game has 3 phases: Random obstacles, rings, and the big wall. Each presents their own unique challenges. There are two power ups. The yellow one is a laser that destroys every obstacle in front of you, the other is additional ammo for your main weapon. It also works on touchscreens, just tap left or right to change lanes and the bottom fourth of your screen to shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a55/a55704bbf06c3e68c4b90ce8e0d70171.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Boss_Golem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
