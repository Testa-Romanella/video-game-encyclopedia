The engine is known for being buggy and having issues, but It aims to help developers create a game with no coding experience.\u00a0 Explore each level and find the open doorway to the next level. I would have liked to have a more professional look to the game (i.e. custom thumbnails etc) but in order to make the game playable, liberties had to be made. Some levels had to be left out for example but they are shown here in the screenshots.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/427/4270ca9193f5a209f2cdf637679e21ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Desert Limbo Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
