Arctic Run it's about a running polar bear as he goes avoiding obstacles in the main land and beneath the ice in an underwater section. You can collect penguins just by colliding with them, they will follow you in your run. If you get hit by an obstacle the game is over, however, if you have a certain number of penguins following you, you'll only lose one of them.</p>\n<p>As for the controls, press <strong>space </strong>to jump, <strong>arrow down</strong> to go down if you are in a higher platform and <strong>hold space</strong> to float if you are underwater.</p>\n<p>After abandoning some Unity projects, this is the first microgame that I manage to finish. I'm aware that there are some performance issues, as well as some undesired bugs and to be honest, it feels a little simple. I just hope to keep improving the style and to deliver some better projects in the near future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/432/43232bc54722c2f0de385c95f1c1520e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spiderhead20"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
