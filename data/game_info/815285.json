Mostly so I know if I should continue working on it or not.</p>\n<p>I already have some more features working properly, but I didnt manage to make a level with them yet. These include:<br/></p>\n<p>-Door with Pressureplates, that can only be activated by the Player or some Object in the Scene<br/>-Bounce Pads, which can bounce you up a certain height (Their earliest Version can be seen in the \"Main Menu\" but I improved them by now)<br/>-Another one I cant think of right now</p>\n<p>Feedback dependent, I may continue developing the game, especially by improving graphics, adding way more levels, adding more mechanics and actually use these mechanics. I will also take suggestions by the players into consideration if they seem good and doable for me.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: This is my first \"Real Game\" so please dont be toxic or something like that, I'm still learning.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:08:47", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuezDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
