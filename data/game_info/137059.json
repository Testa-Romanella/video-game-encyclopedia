Thats why you kill every lone wolf in every town in the god damn USA, now go out there and make someone proud!\" \"Wait dad, who do I have to make proud?\" \"Hell I don't know ma boy, just go out there and kill those pesky bank ma.. uh lone wolfs, and make someone proud!\"</p><p>QaziJam6</p><p>This is my Qazijam6 entry.</p><p>The game is in an kinda unfinished state. There are some small things missing like other hats and stuff.</p><p>What Made, and How:</p><p>Music:<br/>I had this one from a Project before. A friend of mine created the track for me.</p><p>Shot Sound:<br/>I hit my table with a magazine recorded that and applied some filters and effects to it. (High pass filter, Speedchange and so on...)</p><p>Gameplay:<br/>Unity, with C#. Hit me if you want the source code.</p><p>How to play:</p><p>At first you have to holster your weapon (aim at your feet), thats the ready stage where a 3 second long timer ticks down, after the ready timer finishes, another hidden timer starts, the wait timer, while that one counts down, you are not allowed to move, or the other guy kills you instantly.</p><p>And when that timer runs out, a sound can be heard. Then you have to shoot the other guy before he shoots you. </p><p>The enemy takes two shots to the body or one in the head.</p><p>Can you beat me? I've got to level 9, whats your highscore?</p><p>Version 1.1</p><p>Added different forms of houses.<br/>Added a \"dong\" sound<br/>Removed the timer before you are allowed too shoot<br/>Changed the tumbleweed model<br/>Changed the speedfactor of the enemy</p><p>Contact</p><p>E-Mail - wizzardmaker@gmail.com<br/>Write me there if you want the source code/advice or anything, and I try to respond in like 1 to 6 hours.</p><p>Have fun, and feel free to say what you think in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c4/8c47568ab3d7772aa89ff8b8cc0c38fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["WizzardMaker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
