The platform is broken up into several interactive learning games that allow its users to practice and learn language, utilizing the PC, Mobile (Android and iOS), and VR mediums.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpin N Spelle is a game where players spell out the translation of a term using alphabet blocks (Fig. 2). Each controller commands a magic wand that can select, spin, and place the block on a shelf beside the term to be translated. Accents and special symbols (such as the Portuguese \u00e7 and \u00e9) <br/>\r\nare created by adding an accent sticker to the block in the appropriate location. Players can use one hand to hold the block and the other to place the sticker, or they can press B on the controller to \u201cfreeze the physics\u201d in the game world, let go of the block and it will stay in the air while they use the same hand to place the sticker. These features were designed to increase accessibility and user experience. The game can be played in \u201cendless\u201d or \u201cquiz\u201d mode. In endless mode, five shelves for placing blocks that translate five different terms are presented at one time. After a term is spelled correctly, the shelf lights up then disappears (like a completed row in Tetris) and a new one appears, randomly selected from the database. This continues until the player decides to exit the game. In the quiz mode, the game is played the same way, with the variation that the player sees each term only once. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHighrise Hellep is a firefighting game where the player is a firefighter (Fig. 3). A category (adjectives, food, etc.) appears on a road sign, and the player must direct a firehose and its stream of water where a foreign language term that belongs in that category is displayed on a balcony that is on fire. After the player sprays water on all terms in the building that match the category, a green checkmark appears on the sign,  and a new category appears. This game also has endless and quiz modes that mirror those in the block game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T02:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84b/84bb26cf5c76561c23684a9fdbd00ada.jpg", "website": "https://ekjphd.com/elle/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gameslabucf"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["gameslabucf"], "esrb_rating": null}
