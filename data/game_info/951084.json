This is the premise for Cult of The New God. In this game you will manage resources such as gold, knowledge, sanity and of course your expendable followers. Try to avoid the hand of the law, or even infiltrate and corrupt it. The game has 7 gods to choose from each god having a different goal and their own challenges. Will you be able to satisfy them?<br/>This was a game made by me and my class mates and I think we did really well, especially since the team was split\u00a0amongst a bunch of other projects. Be warned there may be some images missing, though the gameplay should be complete.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T18:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/7638034db31d84439af91e0ca6b4e545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superacestriker"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
