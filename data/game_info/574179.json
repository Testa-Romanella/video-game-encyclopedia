The screen will split on each random choice creating up to 64 different versions of the same dungeon running at the same time.</p>\n<p>Focus and zoom in on your preferred reality, then zoom out to\u00a0find out what have been going on in the other realities.<br/></p>\n<p>In one reality you'll be\u00a0wielding a sword and a torch in another. You're both dead and alive and as the\u00a0wave function collapses you will meet your fate in the\u00a0Schr\u00f6dinger Dungeon.</p>\n<p>Move using the arrow keys, move into an enemy to attack<br/></p>\n\n<p>Chests can contain one of four things, so realities split and you get all four.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Keep an eye on everything!<br/>Click on any screen to zoom in and focus on that reality, then space to zoom out again.</p>\n\n<p>A prefect win is possible!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the #7DRL 2021 challenge.\u00a0<br/>Right now it's not completely finished according to my original plans but it's really close and\u00a0the main mechanic is there. Main things missing are: communicating properly what you get from chest and its effects; Dungeon generation; Varied content for Weapons, Spells, etc;\u00a0Better stats at the end of the game</p>\n<p>This is highly experimental so approach this game as a toy rather than a polished experience.</p>\r\nAdditional development files and source code\r\n<p>If you\u00a0donate to show your appreciation you will get additional files with:</p>\n<ul><li>Full source code in JavaScript<ul><li>Yep I coded this in plain JS with no libraries @_@</li><li>My first rogue-like, my first game in JavaScript (it's not pretty code)</li></ul></li><li>Scans of all my notes, including planning,\u00a0discarded ideas, testing algorithms, sketches and other scribbles (basically everything I wrote down during development)</li><li>All the prototypes and work in progress versions of the game.
