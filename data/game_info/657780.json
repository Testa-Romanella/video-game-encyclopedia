It was a little more ambitious in terms of features and gameplay,\u00a0and also contained better basic functionality, like options, pausing, quitting, resolution scaling, etc. It should be noted that I didn't do any art here, kudos to the guy who did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:04:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/097/097ee4d25ba52fb07d709e6644176c6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matt Mrazik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
