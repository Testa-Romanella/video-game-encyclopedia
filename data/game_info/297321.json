{"id": 297321, "slug": "packetstorm", "name": "PacketStorm", "name_original": "PacketStorm", "description": "Many years ago, I learned about Dijkstra's algorithm - the fundamental building blocks of how the internet works. I was fascinated by these, and attempted to implement it myself. I had such fun (because I'm quite frankly a massive nerd) messing about with nodes and graphs that I decided to turn it into a game, written using DirectX 5 and C++. Years later, I ported it to XNA, but didn't finish it. Years LATER, I ported it once more to Unity, and after over a decade of off-on development, I'm proud to release the relaxing and zen-like PacketStorm.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn PacketStorm, you play an AI developing a new Internet Service Provider. Each game takes place over a few second of game-time, but potentially many hours of realtime. Buy up routers, upgrade cable networks and deal with packet jams as you earn money to research new and better upgrades. Move from running a small ISP over England to one spanning the entire world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFREE BONUS - Learn the names and locations of almost every city in the world. It's like learning, but fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16d/16da57b15e6479a01f21fd4ab7cd248a.jpg", "website": "http://www.dmpdesigning.com/packetstorm", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProjectorGames"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ProjectorGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
