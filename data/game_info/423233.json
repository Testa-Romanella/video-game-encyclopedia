Virality is a small game I made in 2 days\u00a0during the Stay Safe! game jam hosted from the 27th to the 29th of March 2020. This is my first ever game jam although I've been developing games\u00a0 for the better part of 3 years as a solo dev. Virality is\u00a0fairly basic, but it ties into the recent corona virus pandemic quite well I think. You play as a cell in the bloodstream of an unknown creature. You've been sent into exterminate all rogue cells and survive for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>You start off with a single white cell and can unlock other cells by surviving to higher waves. With each wave, the enemy horde grows stronger and new cell types will begin to appear as you survive longer. Each cell has a unique ability which you can take into battle if you've unlocked that particular cell. If not, every so often, an item will drop from above somewhere in the bloodstream. Items can either be DNA sequences which will temporarily give you a certain cells special ability, or weapons which have unique firing capabilities. There are currently 5 weapons in the game, each have wildly varying stats. Some are multi-barreled and others shoot powerful globules of mucus. If you survive past wave 15 you should be able to try them all out.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to survive as long as you can. There's no end, the waves will continue to get harder and harder until you die. Once you hit wave 60 all cells in the game are able to\u00a0spawn. From there onwards, only the amount of enemies increases with each successive wave. At that point the game should be extremely difficult to survive. So I challenge you. See how many waves you can survive!</p>\n<p>I composed the 2 original soundtracks for the game myself within the allotted 2 days.\u00a0A main menu theme and a fast-paced, intense track for gameplay. If you'd like to download the tracks for your own listening, please let me know in the discussion below and I'll make them available.</p>\n<p>I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the guys\u00a0who hosted this game jam! It's been an absolute blast to see if how far I can push my skills in such a short time frame.</p>\n<p>Anyway, enough about me,\u00a0I hope ya like the game ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ecfcbd34ab1c1af437afa636993a26a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danstarr13"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
