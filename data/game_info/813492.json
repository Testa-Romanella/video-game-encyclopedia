It is inspired by the short story \u201cThe Egg\u201d, by Andy Weir. You are the main character and when you die you are reincarnated as another character in the game. You finish the game by playing all the characters and achieving their goals. The game, in its full capacity, should give the player the feeling of empathy as they play different characters with different goals and emotions.</p>\n<p>The story happens in an island when a virus is discovered, and all flights get canceled and a 24-hours curfew is instated to avoid the spread of this virus. A girl is stuck after her plane lands in this island for transit. The airlines provide a stay for travelers in a hotel. But with no money on her, she struggles to get food and must survive. She wonders around the hotel trying to get help or find an opportunity to make money. She finds interesting people and makes friends that help in her endeavors. She also faces enemies and bad people that she must avoid or beat. Alongside her survival in the hotel, she discovers secretes that could stop the virus.</p>\n<p>The game is a 2D platformer. The core mechanics comprise mainly of running and jumping as well as interacting with various objects like opening doors and pushing buttons. A lot of doors and floors are locked and can be only accessed using key cards that can be acquired throughout the game. The game will be implemented using Unity and will be initially published for Windows, Mac, and Web. In the future, touch control could be added to support iOS and Android platforms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move right:\u00a0<ul><li>D or right arrow</li></ul></li><li>Move left:\u00a0<ul><li>A or left arrow</li></ul></li><li>Jump:\u00a0<ul><li>Space or left mouse</li></ul></li><li>Action:\u00a0</li><ul><li>E or right mouse</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Future Enhancements:</strong></p><ul><li>Add start game cut scene.</li><li>Add call for acion hints.</li><li>Adjust key throw power.</li><li>Let player eat food.</li><li>Add a dream when sleeping.</li><li>Add a dialogue after waking up.</li><li>Add ice machine and bar in Lounge.</li><li>Add a dialogue when breakfast is not found.</li><li>Fix known issues and bugs.</li></ul><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>UI elements needs to adjust for different resolutions.</li><li>If you don't pick up the key you have to restart the game.</li><li>Walls and colliders are sticky.</li><li>player can still move after entering a door.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c7/8c75c9be50639b694c3d42fce3e384da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["zandergt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
