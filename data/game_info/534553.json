Oh and don't take too long, the sun will be your doom unless you sleep at an igloo(:</p>\n<p>for this game I took some inspiration from the optional mechanic (risk vs reward)\u00a0by making your health bar not just a measurement of your health but also your ammo</p>\n<p>I also used the optional palette\u00a0</p>\n<p>bugs: audio sounds different (low quality, don't know how to fix),\u00a0 I recommend you lower your volume</p>\n<p>things I might add or was gonna add in the future: boss once you reach the inside of the cursed igloo, more juice/ feedback, possibly animations, reward for killing enemies(increased time on timer), improved death system and better music</p>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK APRECIATED\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77d5e76b7e978de5676f2ab1fcfd44f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OwenSpowen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
