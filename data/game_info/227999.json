The campaign is a logistic struggle to keep enough supplies flowing, in spite of the growing British Naval supremacy,to give German Army a fighting chance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/><br/>+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.<br/><br/>+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.<br/><br/>+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.<br/><br/>+ Supports casual play: Easy to pick up, leave off, continue later.<br/><br/>+ Good AI: Instead of just attacking on direct line towards the target, the AI opponent balances between strategic goals and smaller tasks like encircling nearby units.<br/><br/>+ Settings: Various options are available to alter the look of the gaming experience: Change difficulty level, hexagon size, Animation speed, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL) and cities (Round, Shield, Square, block of houses), decide what is drawn on the map, and much more.<br/><br/>+ Tablet friendly strategy game: Automatically scales the map for any physical screen size/resolution from small smartphones to HD tablets, while settings allow you to fine tune hexagon and font sizes.<br/><br/>+ Inexpensive: The classic strategy game campaign for a cup of coffee!<br/><br/><br/>In order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A full version is also available from the app store.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Join your fellow strategy gamers in changing the course of the Second World War!<br/><br/><br/>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password.

The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming elements TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I also want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any indie developer could dream of. if you have feedback about this strategy game series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth conversion without all the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not very sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if somebody has posted a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will answer to it as soon as I'm online.
