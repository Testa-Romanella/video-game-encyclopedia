Let Go of Right Click to Drop, Left Click While Holding to throw.</p>\n<p>WASD and Mouse Controls</p>\n<p>Drop Seeds in Garden Beds and wait for them to grow. Once grown pickup and throw or drop into the red truck to sell.</p>\n<p>Would love some Feedback!</p>\n<p>Planning to maybe add more levels and fix a few gameplay elements in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!!!!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>notes.</p>\n<p>-----------Mouse sentivity was a last minute thing still is kinda funky. I found around 200 is pretty good.--------------</p>\n<p>I made all the assets and sounds myself apart from the main music theme which was made using an AI music genarator.</p>\n<p>The holding is a bit slow and objects you are picking up may get caught on corners. Just look up a bit and it should find its way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82e/82e54c0eff65e2a095e052b39fc28b00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ceo_Tommy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
