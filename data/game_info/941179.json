In my eyes, this game is somewhat like a prototype for a demo for a much larger game lol. There may indeed be jank littered throughout, but regardless I'm still proud of what I learned and ultimately becoming someone who can say they are now officially a game developer. I hope you can enjoy what I managed to throw together and of course, all feedback is welcomed, even if it's you roasting the game :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're interested at all in what my next project may become, please feel free to subscribe to my YouTube channel and help grow the community over there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://youtube.com/@blackcasegames</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T14:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae9bc964e9ac6234196eaadbddf62251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Black Case"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
