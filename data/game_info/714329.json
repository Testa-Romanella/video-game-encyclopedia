I decided to use Unity as while I prefer Unreal overall I know it's 2d is somewhat lackluster. This was the first real 2D game I\u00a0have made in Unity, I made a game entirely in UI using Unity before,\u00a0and while I ran into a few oddities about Unity it did okay overall. I ended up being quite a bit busier during the jam than I expected so I only got a few days to work on the game, but hopefully its still fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T13:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1fe0176b46ce14086de03d7202cb61a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J.Anthracite"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
