This is one of the games released by an independent studio and timed to the release of the big Serious Sam 3: BFE. Version XXL game. Two years after the original release in 2011 as XXL version of the game was released as a free patch for all the owners of the original game.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in the same universe as all other games. The developers have tried to recreate as accurately as possible the original gameplay, which is Serious Sam famous for. And this is an enormous mob of monsters, attacking the protagonist from all sides. At levels, the player can find first-aid kits, weapons, and ammo. The game&#39;s arsenal includes both guns that were already in the game universe and entirely new weapons. Each can be upgraded, and new upgrades significantly simplify the completion of the game.</p>\n<p>Structurally, the game is divided into three episodes. At the end of each player faces a boss. Sometimes the game process is diluted by simple puzzles. One of the distinctive features of the game is the Gunstacker mechanic, which allows you to attach different types of weapons to each other to increase the lethal power. In addition to a single story campaign, the game has a local cooperative for two players.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2011-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:22:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81b/81b39cfee9f2e49f81d4edd7969e075c.jpg", "website": "http://www.serioussam.com", "rating": 2.64, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 81, "owned": 1489, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 32, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 90, "suggestions_count": 521, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 90, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Mommy's Best Games", "Mommys Best Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Croteam", "Mastertronic Group"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
