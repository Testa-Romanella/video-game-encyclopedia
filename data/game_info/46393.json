Buy new balls, upgrade energy amplifiers, size, height and the other things to generate more and more energy. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce your balls energy empire generates enough energy, you will be able to exchange it for powerful meta-energy. You will lose all your balls and energy upgrades, but you can change the world by increasing gravity, density and the other things to speed up your run.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMake the balls jump, upgrade and change the world! Drop the balls to generate energy with each bounce. Upgrade available balls and buy new ones to generate even more energy. Sell your balls empire to get meta-energy to change the world!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-29T09:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/760964af6728e2a84a51369b2cbf4d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 170, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Upturn Games", "Huiwei Jiang", "IDLE GAMES FREE"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Upturn Games", "Huiwei Jiang"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
