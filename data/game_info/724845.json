It's still rough around the edges, with somewhat cringey voice acting and writing - but these things just leave room for the project to grow.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:32:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bda8e8c49c1a7925c5ed7e9a2df80f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erik Prinz"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
