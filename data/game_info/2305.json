See reviews and video on support site www.vertigorogue.com<br/><br/>As an ex-con mercenary fighter pilot about to retire and settle down, you are whirled into a sinister plot where you are forced to enact the role of a flying mafia hitman in a city where the on-going conflict between 7 criminal organizations is about to spin out of control in a frantic, explosive climax.<br/><br/>Vertigo Rogue Lite features:<br/>1. A short campaign including 4 Vertigo Rogue missions<br/>2. A huge, detailed landscape of unprecedented complexity<br/>3. Advanced, realistic graphics in a rich and populated environment<br/>4. A selection of 8 different weapon types<br/>5. A powerful, yet simple and intuitive two-thumb control system<br/>6. Advanced 3D sound environment<br/>7. Optional stereoscopic, red/blue color-filtered 3D mode<br/><br/>Note: 3D glasses are of course not included, but if you happen to have a pair of those old cardboard goggles with a red/blue 3D filter, turn on the 3D mode and enjoy the REAL vertigo effect!<br/>Note that in stereoscopic mode, the frame rate will be lower and the most convincing depth effect is achieved on the newest generations of iPod Touch/iPhones.
