To increase its power, the Majapahit Empire was building relationships with its nearby kingdoms in the reign of King Hayam Wuruk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One neighboring kingdom was the Sunda Kingdom, where the extraordinarily beautiful princess Citraresmi resided. King Hayam Wuruk decided to take her as his spouse to build a relationship between the two empires.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Delighted with the wedding proposal, the King of Sunda Kingdom and the royal family arrived in Majapahit and encamped on the Bubat Square. However, Gajah Mada, the prime minister of Majapahit took this opportunity to demand Sunda\u2019s submission to the Majapahit Empire. He insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a token of submission and treated as a mere concubine of King Hayam Wuruk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Angered by the humiliation of Gajah Mada\u2019s insults, a skirmish took place on the Bubat square between the Majapahit and Sunda Kingdom. Majapahit Empire, who was led by Gajah Mada, took a full force to eliminate King Prabu and the royal family in their camp.\r\nYou\u2019re playing as the Sunda Kingdom where you need to defend yourself against the powerful Gajah Mada\u2019s Army.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0--------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The game features support for point and click in mouse control\r\n</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Game is developed by these amazing Developers, Artists and Musicians:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>- Mai - Game Designer and Game Programmer<br/>-\u00a0HardRain - Lead Game Programmer<br/>- Lucky90Happy - Game Arts<br/>- Ian Coulter - Music and Sound Effects<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0--------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>- SFXs are from epidemic sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>- Monogram font by datagoblin</p>\n<p>\u00a0--------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Engine:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>- The game is made in Godot.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0--------------------------------------\u00a0<br/>** an executable for windows OS is also provided if you can't play it on the browser.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:34:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/32344bf0a9ff58c2390532cbe8c097ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HardRain", "Lucky90Happy", "MaiGamesDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
