This includes;\u00a0posting on social media about the topics and frequency the victim has posted before, going through old chat logs and understanding how to appropriately message their friends, and go through their search history in order understand what the victim's interests were. You must do this all in order\u00a0to not alert suspicion among the other player's until you can run out the time and\u00a0get out of town.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>If you're the bystander:</strong>\u00a0You must monitor each other's online activity, including what people are posting, and what kinds of things people are messaging each other. Bystanders have an advantage as they\u00a0are equipped\u00a0with a \"character card\" of the character they're playing as, which includes name, pronouns, interests, and information on what kind of relationships they have with the other characters. Murderer has none of this information and must find out through exploring the victim's phone.\u00a0 You must figure out who is the murderer and call the police on someone before the end of the game. If the majority of the bystanders choose the right person, the murderer will be caught and arrested. However the majority chooses wrong, the murderer will get away and the victim will have died without justice.<br/><br/>When it comes to digital identity, do you really know who's behind the screen?\u00a0<br/><br/>This is a playable proof of concept done a week before a two-week game jam. The future of this prototype\u00a0is unknown.<br/><br/>Contributors:<br/>Senior programmer, unity developer Maria Deslis @eternalearth88</p><p>Artist, unity developer F.
