It's a thief's motto that works well if you don't have links and if you don't want to have them in your life.\r\nThe Heat is a medium-length adventure for Special Agency. It has a lot to do with the movie Heat, in which professional bank robbers do what they do best while being chased by the police. The adventure is designed to be played in two ways and in several sessions: the same group can play as cops, and later play the same game as robbers, with some modifications by the Overseer.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThis Case is the one included in the basic Special Agency manual. There are 40 pages in which you will find what you need to play a game of Special Agency: twelve pre-generated characters, some motivations and events and five locations where to play specific scenes: a bank, an armored car, a jewelry store... Maps and graphics are included, as well as some ideas that expand the Special Agency case format.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95d/95d6951355689bd47aa4d22961182690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juancho Duma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
