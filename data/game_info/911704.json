I added graphics and sound to this game some time ago when I ported it to PICO-8. This required some mechanics and user interface changes, but the spirit of the game was left intact.</p>\n<p>Being a massive fan of the 1992 Interplay adventure Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, at some point, I\u00a0had an idea: why not\u00a0merge the graphics of the Interplay adventure with the\u00a0mechanics of the\u00a0strategy game?\u00a0The result is Super Star Trek but played\u00a0on the Enterprise's bridge. In short, you will be playing the strategy game\u00a0on the\u00a0main screen of the Enterprise, but you will issue commands by interacting with <em>Sulu</em>, <em>Chekov</em>, <em>Spock</em>, <em>Scott</em>, and <em>Uhura</em>. Additionally,\u00a0I added original voices from the TV series to make things even more nostalgic.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p><em>To see the list of available commands, press F1.</em></p>\n<p>Your goal is to find and destroy the Klingon invasion fleet before the time expires, generally around 30 days.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>You start in a random sector. There are 64 of them divided into an 8x8 grid. Not all of them have enemies.</li><li>If your sector has Klingons, attack them. Otherwise, you can use\u00a0the long-range sensors to see if there are Klingons in the surrounding sectors.</li><li>During the scan, you will see a three digits number for each sector.\u00a0The first digit is the number of Klingon ships, the second the number of starbases, and the third the number of stars. E.g., \"205\" means there are two enemy ships;<br/>\n</li><li>To move to another sector, ask Sulu to activate the Warp engines. On\u00a0the map,\u00a0\u00a0select the sector you want to jump to. Sectors with enemies are red.</li><li>Before you attack, it's better to raise shields. Click on the shields with the mouse and select the amount of energy to move to the shields.</li><li>You can attack with Phasers or Photon torpedoes. Torpedoes always destroy the enemy and don't consume energy, but you must select the direction. Phasers never miss and hit all the enemies on the screen; note that the energy will be split if you attack multiple enemies.</li><li>After you have attacked, the remaining Klingons will attack you; if you are hit, the Enterprise can be damaged. A damaged system can stop working, so be careful.</li><li>You need to find a starbase to replenish your energy or repair damaged systems. Once you have found a sector with a base, ask Uhura to contact the starbase to start the docking procedures.</li><li>Impulse engines are needed to move the Enterprise close\u00a0to a starbase or to move the ship to a more favorable position (e.g., to use torpedoes).</li></ul>\n<p>If you find the game too easy or difficult, press the Esc key to open the options, change the difficulty level, then restart.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p><em>Note: I mention the year 1978 because there are many versions of Super Star Trek. This game is faithful to the 1978 version and based on the BASIC code published in the BASIC COMPUTER GAMES book.\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T07:03:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f011edd5cdfd3084fa23c02f5d59941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["emabolo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
