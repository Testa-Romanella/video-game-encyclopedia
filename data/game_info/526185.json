The protagonist, Shem 'Etzem, can move around (WASD keys), use a punch attack (Comma key) or fire a bone shard projectile (Period key) at his enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>The current enemies are the stabbing Guf soldier and the shooting Guf soldier. Defeat them for points and healing Medicinal Eye Bandages. Stay alive as long as possible and earn a high score, but beware: The enemies also grow stronger over time!</p>\n<p>\r\nWe plan to upgrade the demo every few weeks into a full-fledged game with lots of new features. In the next three months, the game\u2019s development will focus on a dynamic inventory system plus new enemies, weapons, abilities, battlefields and items, including the 22 Hebrew letters.</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you like what you see, please donate to us.
