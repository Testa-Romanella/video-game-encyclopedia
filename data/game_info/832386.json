Obviously, of course. This minigame could be the official PC adaptation with CGI graphics if someone dared to do such a crazy thing.</p>\n<p>I intended to create a video game in the shortest time possible and took inspiration from the movie I watched the day before.<strong>\u00a0It took me exactly 12 hours</strong> to draw the sprites, program the game (I used GameMaker Studio), and create the music and sound effects. So here's the result of my\u00a0self-challenge mini game jam.</p>\n<p>I have used GameMaker Studio and coded all the internal logic using GML. The last time I did anything with this tool was ten years ago, so I've had to re-learn as I go.</p>\n<p>Main features:</p>\n<ul><li>Low-Res CGI graphics like it's 1984!</li><li>Control Mark as he tries to keep his sanity in the subway tunnel!</li><li>Get the highest score by defeating Anna and the tentacled creature!</li></ul>\n<p>Could this nonsense become more than just a prototype? Time will tell!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T10:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58f/58fe0a0323b5742ea9860ad76f04fab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElRoSSo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
