It was in the coding module and it taught me to script in C# in Unity/ Monodevelop. </p><p>The game itself is a basic platformer. You must jump from platform to platform to escape the lava however the lava is your only light source as you move up so if you get too far ahead, you won't know where to go next. </p><p>I made all the assets in this game except for the (amazing) lava particle effects found Here at Inferno VFX and the player which one of my teachers created. </p><p>PS the game may run like garbage :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["obiwanjezz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
