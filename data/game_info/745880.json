Team of two beginners made it happen, So don't expect it to be mind blowing.. We did our Best with this one, We'll Appreciate if you give it a try :) Thanks</p>\n\n<p>You as a Player is stuck in a Strange Dimension, Where everything about it feels wrong. This is not the place you wanna be in. You have to find a Way back to your Dimension and for that you have to hurry to the last planet on this dimension, Why in hurry you ask? Because the Dimension behind you is slowly fading away. You will find Obstacles in your way. There are some ghost Enemies, you cant kill them but if you or they touch you, the fading behind you speeds up.. Basically you have to Differentiate between Enemies and if you kill wrong one, your chances of survival will decrease. Can you complete this Joruney of hardships? We'll see about that :)</p>\n\n<p>You will find two types of enemies in this dimension (GAME JAM VERSION), Full Version of the game will include more enemies.</p>\r\nPatrol Boi\r\n\r\nFlying Boi\r\n\n\n<p>This is a Small Game Jam Version and we planned to release the full game soon.. So stay tuned :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T03:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/766/7665c57cf6b5d0a242e24631c48e39fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rayan Aziz", "Ammar5512"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
