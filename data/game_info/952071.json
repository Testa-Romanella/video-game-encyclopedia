In short, her knowledge must be handed down and <strong>YOU</strong> - a former adventurer whose career was cut short by mixture intolerance - <strong>will be the perfect candidate</strong>!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Together with your goblin assistant, <strong>build automated production lines of alchemical workstations</strong> to provide potent mixtures to the local heroes, assisting them in their epic quests, and making you their favorite potion supplier. <strong>Explore</strong> diverse biomes and use your remaining adventuring abilities to <strong>gather and research exotic ingredients</strong>, leading to new mixing opportunities. Get ready to face all the \u201cwax on, wax off\u201d challenges Griselda throws at you to bring the shop back to its former glory!<br/><br/><h3>\u2022 Accessible, automated potion brewing</h3>Create fully automated production pipelines from a varied catalogue of workstations to produce potions. Balance liquid ratio, maximize potency, pick the right ingredients, balance flavors and pour it all on the fanciest bottle you can craft to create the potion!<h3>\u2022 A Vibrant, Cozy, and Colorful world!</h3>A mix of colorful illustration designs with a pinch of cheeky classic fantasy humor but still an alchemically-cozy experience. Different environments to explore and gather your ingredients. But be careful! Some flora and fauna will fight back\u2026<h3>\u2022 Happy customers always come back! Especially if they are \u201chooked\u201d</h3>Not all heroes want the same potions, so take your time to get to know your customers. As they level up, their demand for stronger and more advanced mixtures grow, turning them into very loyal customers - and turning your pockets heavy with coins!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T20:51:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ed/4edbb0cfb981fc93f5cf416639a24a65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 429, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glowlight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HOOK"], "esrb_rating": null}
