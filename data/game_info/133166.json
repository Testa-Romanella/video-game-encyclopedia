This started out as some practice before teaching a game design unit to my students, then I got sucked in. </p><p>I knew I wanted to convert a single button press into multiple inputs. I started thinking about creating somesort of binary tapping system, and landed on this model of mulltiple taps. With the mechanic locked down, I came up with the context. Your squadmate is stuck, and you need to flash your light to communicate obstacles. While the context works, I was incapable of making the artwork to really sell the idea, so I stuck with my abstract Unity primatives...a little relaxing music to set an entirely different tone to the game. </p><p>I did push out a WebGL build from Unity, but I suggest downloading it for the best experience.</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong></p><ul><li>One of your squadmates has become separated from the rest of the squad.</li><li>You must guide him through the fields using only your flashlight. Use any key to flash the light.<ul><li>One flash, move forward.</li><li>Two flash, move left.</li><li>Three flash, move right.</li><li>Four flash, move backward.</li></ul></li><li>Stay on the path, and avoid the patrols and make it to the safe zone, the red tile.</li></ul><p><strong>Future Plans</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Perhaps build out some artwork. Low poly characters for the player and the 'enemy' patrol. Some graphics for mines, barbed wired, etc.</li><li>Redesign the levels. The level progress in difficulty, but if I put more time into it, it could make the game much nicer to play.</li><li>Implement tap inputs for mobile devices.</li><li>Perhaps a level selection screen, unlocking each one.</li></ul><p>Any and all feedback is welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/386/38651c04d08cca32f90fe9ce737dcacc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["barnes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
