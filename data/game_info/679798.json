Along with an array of sounds and guitar riffs, there are lyrics that mean something deeper than what is presented. To me it is an explanation of money and the different evils and/or joys it brings. Within the game the player choses how much money affects their play/life and how long it goes on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T09:19:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f52/f528cddfc02ca13dc244717ed22a7db3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hcmiller11"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
