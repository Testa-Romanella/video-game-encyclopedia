The reason I still chose to work with the Unity engine is the accessibility it offers as well as the highly customizable and advanced quality rendering technology. Using the C # programming language is the standard mode of the Unity programming program.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The game is currently available on Android devices (from Android 4 onwards) and in the near future will also be available on devices with the IOS operating system.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The player, first introduced to the game world, is greeted by: a punching bag and 3 buttons, on which to find some symbols. The object of the game is to increase the scale called \"Power\" and decrease the one called \"Remaining\" by clicking on the punching bag. The punching bag is the object on the screen that needs to be pressed to increase the \"Power\" scale and decrease \"Remaining\".\r\n  </p>\n<p>The three buttons, along with visual support, are \"upgrade\" buttons that can help the player increase the \"Power\" scale but at a specific cost, which is specified above the button in question.\r\n  </p>\n<p>One of the problems that the ClickBoxer game solves, and the best example, would be the moments of boredom that occurred while waiting for buses or taxis.\r\n  </p>\n<p>From my point of view, the application has favorable results and it represents a personal success, which is just the beginning of other and more advanced projects.</p>\n<p>The application is designed to remedy the boring situations encountered in everyday life.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T12:50:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b49de60073d94981808be5a384c927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Mishu1211"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
