The eventual idea is that more players will get to compete against each other in different rooms (or battle arenas like clash of clans) based on variations in whot! rules.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a very early release (First Playable or Pre-Alpha) of the game so it might be buggy. Also to note, for now only 20 concurrent players can be on the game at once. Meaning only 5 rooms can be active at once if 4 players are in each 5 rooms. \u00a0Other players would then not be able to join in on the action.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17b/17bb7dc7ebd5d9a47641397fff4595f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["oluwaseyeayinla"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
