Feedback is very welcome :)</p>\n<p>Hyper Fighter is a shoot'em up where you pilot a spaceship and navigate your way through the end of the game by fighting swarms of enemies.</p>\n<p>So far the game only features 2 enemies and has a very short single level as it is mostly a demo (the maximum score is 4400 for about 30 seconds of gameplay), so that I can get some feedback, but development is active so if you come back next week (or even tomorrow) there \u00a0will likely be more content. The goal is to make a game with 3 levels that have a lifespan each of about 5 minutes, for a total of 15 minutes. The final game will be released for free.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The keyboard controls\u00a0 are included in the splash screen, but you can also use an XBox controller :</p>\n<p>(Keyboard / XBox Controller)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Start the game / Pause : Space / Start</li><li>Move : Arrow keys / D-Pad</li><li>Fire : X / A</li><li>Move slowly : Hold Left shift / LB</li><li>Toggle debug overlay : F12 / [only on keyboard]</li><li>Reset game in debug : R / [only on keyboard]</li></ul>\n\n<p>For now only a Windows build is provided, but I have plans to make a Linux build too once I figure out how to use AppImage :)</p>\n<p>Promotional pictures include an asset from vnitti (https://vnitti.itch.io), see the LICENSES.txt file in the zip archive for the full license and credits.
