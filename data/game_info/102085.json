It is made up of nine small levels. You play as an alligator assisted by a plover bird, who will circle around the player and help them in various ways!</p>\n<p>The plover can pick up bits of slime, which the alligator can use to get an extra jump, hit switches, or pick up enemies with. There are also obstacles the plover must avoid, so be careful! Later on the plover can pick up spike blocks as well, which can destroy obstacles\u00a0(and are obstacles themselves, even!). \u00a0In the last level, all the plover's abilities are put to use in one final test!</p>\n<p>(for an extra challenge, each level has an egg you can try to collect!)</p>\n<p>Plover Parent was made with the following tools/resources:</p>\n<ul><li>Stencyl (game engine)</li><li>Aesprite (art)</li><li>\"Plains\"\u00a0tileset by Ceric (available on StencylForge) (with additions and modifications by Kyle Labriola)</li><li>as3sxfr (sound effects)</li><li>REAPER (music sequencing)</li><li>Kontakt and several SNES sample libraries</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming + Audio: Alexander Rosetti</li><li>Art + Animation: Kyle Labriola</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb440d66df305fe745e5d31bbd828e53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Rosetti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
