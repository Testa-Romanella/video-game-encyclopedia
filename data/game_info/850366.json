Built a Rube Goldberg's machine and mainly experimented with ramps and bouncing mechanics with the spheres. Used a bridge but ended up not needing it much, but pretty fun to try and attempt it. Got most of the graphics online and used a pirate theme of sorts of a cannon ball being launched into a beach. Main purpose of project was to familiarize myself with the physics of the unity engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T11:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/826e5008ecb4019b1b95b79d04314dbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["jbautista5435"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
