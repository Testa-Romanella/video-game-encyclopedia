Your dog was whimpering, begging to be let out, and you, unable in good conscience to ignore your sweet dog\u2019s pleas, did just that. Now all you can see in your yard is emptiness, and a hole in the fence. What will you do?\"</p>\n<p>This is a very short demo of the text adventure I was working on during the My First Game Jam: Summer 2019\u00a0! The full game will be a \"\"horror\"\" game that doesn't really take itself that seriously, all about finding your dog in the woods! It will have multiple ending (such as good, or bad) and many different choices.\u00a0I hope to have the full game eventually up and running soon !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:33:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdcbc1280854b9d7f23b8dc58c5ac3dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fancy_octo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
