Practically, throughout the entire game, the player will control the three protagonists, Tommy, Velma and Bianca both in battles and on the map of the kingdoms and interiors. Tommy is the first controllable character, this is a man who for five years was the commander of the human army, who fought against the monsters that threatened to dominate the four kingdoms: Green Kingdom, Modern Kingdom, Sky Kingdom and Hell Kingdom. Unfortunately, the human army succumbs to the monsters, and they take over and establish a horrible dictatorship, turning the world into a place of terror. The new evil king, DarkLord, decides to punish Tommy by sentencing his daughters to prison. Although he expected Tommy to agree to become a slave to free his daughters, he gets exactly the opposite and triggers a revolt inside Tommy, being willing to start a new war to free his daughters and the world. The protagonist can initially explore the Green Kingdom, which he must free by capturing all the castles in that kingdom, castles that are guarded by various diabolical individuals and monsters, with whom he must fight. The player can equip the characters in the game with weapons and armor, eat or drink potions to regenerate life or magical energy, play at the casino or work at different jobs, visit the school to learn new skills or buy businesses, imitations or street vendors' products. Also, the characters of the game can train at events, where they become stronger and win many prizes. Velma is a young girl who helps Tommy a lot, as she is a spy in the monster army and knows all their weaknesses. This has the same goal as Tommy, to dethrone DarkLord in order to be reunited with her triplets. Later, Bianca, a witch, joins the team after Tommy and Velma save her from a slime attack. The three liberate castle after castle and kingdom after kingdom, but things are not as easy as they thought. The team is facing serious problems and they have to overcome dozens of obstacles. Will they face these problems? It's strictly up to you, the player!</em><br/><br/></p>\n<p>DEVELOPERS: Alhavera Studios<br/>PUBLISHERS: Indie Frozenbite Games<br/>PRODUCERS: Indie Frozenbite Games<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dima Alexandru<br/><em><strong>Programmer</strong></em><em>: Ghioculet Costin</em><br/><em><strong>Series:</strong></em><em>\u00a0Monsters Road</em><br/><em><strong>Engine</strong></em><em>: RPG MAKER MV</em><br/><em><strong>Platforms</strong></em><em>: Windows (September 20, 2022)</em><br/><em>Android (coming soon)</em><br/><em>MacOS (coming soon)</em><br/><em>Linux (coming soon)</em><br/><em>Browser (coming soon)</em><br/><em><strong>Release</strong></em><em>: October - November 2022</em><br/><em><strong>Genre</strong></em><em>: RPG</em><br/><em>Adventure</em><br/><em><strong>Modes</strong></em><em>: Singleplayer</em></p>\n<p><strong>TAGS:\u00a0</strong>#adventure #rpg #action #pointnclick #other<br/>Indie Frozenbite Games #strategy\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T12:03:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e28/e280b88e421b78ffd5a6d6428a1df70b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FROZENBITE"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
