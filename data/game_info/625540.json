But suddenly misfortune happened to him, it started raining. What a fate waiting for our hero if a drop falls into him, I think it's not worth describing.</p>\n<p>The first improvement increases the number of drops that the main character can endure. However, with each blow, it becomes more difficult for him to move, and he also increases in size.</p>\n<p>The second upgrade grants a new ability. Bread sniffs cinnamon and therefore accelerates, it may seem that time will slow down, but this is only a distortion perception. The duration increases by 2 game seconds with each level levelling and the cooldown of the ability is reduced by 20 seconds, starting from 60 seconds on the first level.</p>\n<p>The third upgrade also grants a new ability. Khlebushek uses his bread</p>\n<p>magic and gains a magic shield that will block the next drop that hits the hero. The duration of the shield is equal to the level of the ability multiplied by 5. Ability cooldown decreases by 25 seconds, starting at 75 seconds at the first level.</p><p><strong>Guide</strong></p><p>A, D - to move left and right.</p><p>Space - to jump.</p>\n<p>Worked on the game:</p>\n<p>Nintoryan - Idea, programming, music</p>\n<p>Hazel - Artist</p>\n<p>Zuziassa - Artist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T07:33:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873460c1bdbd02dd1136ca72ddb3b9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nintoryan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
