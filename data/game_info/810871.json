{"id": 810871, "slug": "robotsplit", "name": "RobotSplit", "name_original": "RobotSplit", "description": "<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>RobotSplit is a puzzle platformer where the player gets to control the protagonist Stix both as a whole entity as well as two autonomous objects. The game is focused on puzzle solving rather than violent solutions. It's a game for children and adults - a family game. When the player has mastered all of the levels and puzzles that the evil Meanix has generated the game is won!</p>\n<p><strong>Development<br/></strong>It all started out as a freshmen project in 2013 at the University of Sk\u00f6vde, where the original idea was a game where the player would control a zombie solving puzzles using its body parts. The zombie later on became a robot and eventually named Stix... and so RobotSplit was born.<br/><br/>The core team (Eric, Ricky, Robbin, Mats) continued the game development utilizing resources of the university campus, such as an incubator called Gothia Science Park. During its first year of development the game prototype got an honorary mention at Sweden Game Conference and received the Runner Up spot at the SAGA Awards due to its creative gameplay.<br/><br/>To finish the game as a final product the team drafted a few more resources for graphics (Evelina, Xandra, Lena) and audio (Dan).<br/><br/>During 2014 an early version of what would be the final game in 2015 was displayed and playable at Gamex (Stockholm) and Gamescom (Cologne).</p>\n<p><strong>Staff</strong><br/>RobotSplit<br/><br/>Eric Bj\u00f6rkvall - Design/Author<br/>Ricky L\u00f6fqvist - Production<br/>Robbin Torstensson - Programming<br/>Mats Dahlstr\u00f6m - Programming<br/>Evelina Waara - Graphics<br/>Dan Bergh - Music/Sound Effects<br/><br/><strong>Additional Help</strong><br/>Xandra van Antwerpen - Graphics/Concepts<br/>Lena Envall - Animation/Concepts<br/><br/><strong>Special Thanks</strong><br/>Ellen Broberg<br/>Filip Engman<br/>Jiro Yoshida<br/>Atle F\u00e4gersten<br/>John Dahlquist<br/>Rasmus Bj\u00f6rk<br/>Konrad Petterson<br/>Joel Mellstr\u00f6m<br/>Sander Danielsson<br/>Jessica L\u00f6nn<br/>Michael \"Chmekt\" L\u00f6nn<br/>Jonas Wahlstedt<br/>University of Sk\u00f6vde<br/>Gothia Science Park<br/>Gothia Incubator<br/>Sweden Game Arena</p>\n<p><strong>Setup</strong><br/>Extract/unzip the installer.
