You are dropped into an asteroid field, or a battlefield, which ever is closest, and need to make repairs on your ship before you run out of air. As you explore you will find things. Some of these things may be data caches containing stories from people who no longer exist. Some may be dangerous explosives ready to go off if you get too close. Either way nothing will be revealed with out getting out there and exploring. Search the husks of dead ships and the space around them to see what you can find. There's even a secret or two if you can piece it all together.</p><p>V1.1.1 is now available. This version fixes a few UI bugs that were hindering the game.</p><p>The music in 109 is the work of Erick McNerney</p><p>https://soundcloud.com/erickmcnerney<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873a6dc419187b36778ded29ad78fc61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 192, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Face Hater Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
