Create unit cards, place them on one of three lines, and watch them capture outposts and fight enemy units! However, due to the lack of direct control over the units, one must carefully plan one's actions in advance so as not to leave any of the lines defenseless against the enemy army. The game is designed for short matches of 3 - 5 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T09:19:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d8/2d8dbf9f512f44c4412af5c1622cbe61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Necury"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
