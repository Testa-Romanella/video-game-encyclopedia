None of these are game breaking, but just so you are aware, here is a list of known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>If/when you lose a life, the player's health bar does not refill until they are hit again.\u00a0</li><li>When the life counter displays 0, the game does not end until the player's life bar is depleted one more time. <strong>(Note: this may not be a bug, it may be wanted functionality, to give the player another life, I am currently undecided on this.)<br/></strong></li><li>Menu text occasionally doesn't display with custom font.</li><li>Not really a bug, but worth noting, the Boss' sprites are placeholder art.</li></ul>\n<p>If anyone comes happens across another bug not mentioned here, please make me aware (in the comments below, or on social media if you wish) and I can add it to the list (and hopefully find a fix for the next build).
