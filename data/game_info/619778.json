Red and green art connected via some mysterious force that jumbled their ability to do things. Jump might be space for one but shift for the other. Solve each puzzle to escape the mysterious world.</p><p>\n</p><p>Unfortunately, the webgl version doesn't have sound because of a last second bug. If you would like to get the full experience, please download the windows version. If you are playing the webgl version, please go full screen because it cuts off the edge of the screen.</p>\n<p>I made this game specifically\u00a0for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2021 Game Jam. I am proud of what I accomplished in the time provided seeing as how this was my first game jam. I didn't really know what to expect lol. It probably would've gone better with a team, but I think it was an enjoyable experience still. Feel free to leave feedback and let me know if you liked the game\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/591/5916f408ad6a8db5fc27dbd53dcec042.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jwelchBradley"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
