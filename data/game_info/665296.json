Instead, I've decided to use the shell of this game as a way to talk about and reflect on my first year as a game maker, as well as the development process for this game. I've taken to calling it a time capsule or a playable blog post, so please factor that into your expectations!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b2ac98bbeccc62cd3ba1da5db0e9239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jeff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
