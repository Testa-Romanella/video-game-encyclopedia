It is about a ghost, aptly named Ghosty Boi, who wants to participate in the thrill of trick-or-treating. His transparent nature poses a unique problem. Using the help of his friends and sometimes rivals, he will need to collect items for the perfect costume.</p>\n<p>Between becoming a chef, spider, and rap-battling a Raccoon, the journey is bound to be interesting.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>All code and art were made by me. There is no music as that was a whole new challenge, but I suggest these spooky songs to get you in the mood.</p>\n<p>'This is Halloween' - the nightmare before Christmas</p>\n<p>'Oggie Boogie's song' - the nightmare before Christmas</p>\n<p>'Calling all the monsters' - China Anne McClain</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the product of a, now hazy, week of work. There is a special challenge for those that read this far: somewhere in the game is a hidden duck. If you find it, put a *quack* in the comments. :)</p>\n\n<p>P.S there are some bugs... but I have no clue how to fix them. They usually go away if you go to a new tab then come back or just reload the game. Here's to hoping you never have to deal with them :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T07:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c6/6c6836a67c51ca56ac0c2d09b7877d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ducky and Co."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
