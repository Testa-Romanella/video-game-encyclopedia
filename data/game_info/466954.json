{"id": 466954, "slug": "random-playing-game", "name": "Random Playing Game", "name_original": "Random Playing Game", "description": "<p>This is a twist to any Role Playing Game, where you roll dice and have a skilled character.\u00a0But here, you are attributed with random stats from 0 to 10000 at character creation and you have no control at what you're good at, it's pure random and you must roll dice to handle various situations within the game. You'll be dying a lot, but I think it's part of the fun. That make the game more of a (un)lucky point &amp; click than a RPG, but, well.</p><p>I also put a lot more work on comedy than gameplay, I hope you will still like the game !</p><p>This game was made using Unity. It might have a few broken english sentences, but it's part of a game jam fun I guess. I take a lot of fun coming with silly stories and characters for my jam game, this is no exception.</p><p>Every piece of visual art and coding were made within the jam in 48h by myself. Only the sound effects and music were taken from the web. Speaking of that, here's the credits to the amazing authors :</p><p>The Title theme:\u00a0Caketown\u00a0by\u00a0<strong>Matthew Pablo.</strong></p><p>Battle 1 theme : Some\u00a0Militaristic Music by <strong>Spring</strong>.</p><p>Battle 2 theme : Dulcet by\u00a0poinl.</p><p>Battle 3 theme : Battle Music by\u00a0<strong>Peter Eastman</strong>.</p>End note\r\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you enjoyed this silly game, feel free to comment anything and to rate the game, it helps me on my future projects !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c7/1c7b5341476bda4b158089b780c39808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quentin Delvallet"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
