Roots are more expensive to divide.<br/><br/>Grow your <strong>branches</strong> to get more energy. Branches are more expensive to extend\r\n<p>To expand you need sap, taken from the <strong>reserve</strong>.\u00a0The circular indicator appearing when you extend something shows you how much it will take from the sap reserve.</p>\r\n\u00a0Sap reserve\r\n\r\n<p>The arrow\u00a0(red or green)\u00a0on the sap reserve shows how much sap you earn or lose according to production/consumption balance.<br/></p>\n<p>The more you have roots the more you can stock in the reserve.</p>\r\nRespiration\r\n<strong>Production (combination of blue and yellow bars)</strong>:<br/>\u00a0water + energy = sap (photosynthesis)\r\n<br/><br/><strong>Consumption (brown bar)</strong>:<br/>upkeep cost. \u00a0Divided in several segments representing consumption of roots, leaves, flowers and fruits.<br/> Some parts need more sap than others.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0<br/><strong>Balance (red/green)</strong>:<br/>red when consume more than produce, you lose sap. green for the inverse.<br/>Sap reserve is updated according to balance.\r\n<p>The white graduations indicate sap units, you must have energy and water bars above one graduation to produce one new unit of sap.<br/></p>\r\nClimate\r\n<p>Keep an eye on the weather, learn how the climate evolves and use seasonnalities at your advantage.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>Luminosity</strong>: impacts the amount of energy received by the leaves.<br/><br/><strong>Humidity</strong>: impacts the amount of water on the surface\r\nBloom\r\n<p>Start the bloom process by pushing the flower button.\u00a0From the bud to the mature fruit you'll need lot of sap in stock.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>In wet region, develop a network of roots near the surface.</li><li>There are random water tables, far in the ground.</li><li>You can remove the extremity of a branch or a root by clicking on it.</li></ul>\r\nNext\r\n<ul><li>Use seeds to evolve, customize and adapt to extreme conditions</li><li>Manage nutrients</li><li>Defend yourself against parasites</li><li>And so much more!</li></ul>\r\nCrowdfunding\r\n<p>You like the concept?
