{"id": 605236, "slug": "triadcentroid", "name": "triadCentroid", "name_original": "triadCentroid", "description": "Welcome to the land of Prift \u2013 a former country that had recently broke apart into a collection of city-states, each with their own outlook on the present and future. Since the collapse, a group of cities dubbed the Triad have relied on the shared spoils of mines \u2013 located directly on the point where their territories meet, and crucial for the production of silicon \u2013 to encourage economic growth.\u00a0\r\n<br/><br/>When their output began to dwindle, rumors surfaced that an even rarer resource was located deeper below. This prompted the cities to engage in gang-like warfare to take the mines for themselves, ending a long-standing declaration of the area as neutral ground. But when the rules changed one day in 3019, there was just one question: why is control of the Triad\u2019s main source of economic power now being decided by augmented reality laser tag?\r\nDig deeper...\r\n<p>triadCentroid is a\u00a0top-down shooter game that is in development by me and my brother DakronV, set in a world that mixes technology's past with technology's present. While many of the notable indie entries into this genre have emphasized a more roguelike experience with randomized maps, triadCentroid is designed to be more of a narrative-based game, with a focus on a balance of action and humor.</p>\n<p>The alpha build hosted here is what we have called \"Episode 0\"; it is a\u00a0small, early look at what we have in mind for this project. As time goes on and we go over the various nooks and crannies with a fine-toothed comb to flesh things out further, we hope that this will eventually evolve into more of a full game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Video games are about having fun. Video game development is about sharing your vision of \"fun\" with the world. And we hope you'll join us for this journey! Saskatchewan is starting to gain some prominence in this department, and we're good at supporting each other (for the most part anyway).</p>\r\nJoin us...\r\n<ul><li>Discord</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T09:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43f/43fa4d65f38132406170b166534ce967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lirodon", "DakronV"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
