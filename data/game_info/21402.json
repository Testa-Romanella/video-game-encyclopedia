Blast aliens and kick robots in the face as you traverse each level; collecting weapons and gaining experience along the way. How far will you go when death lurks around every corner? Will you reach the 100th level and destroy the source of the station\u2019s corruption? Probably not, but it\u2019s worth a try. <br/><br/><strong>GAME FEATURES:</strong><br/><ul><li>Fast-paced and challenging gameplay! <br/></li><li>More guns than you can shake a stick at!
