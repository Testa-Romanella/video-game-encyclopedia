Such as, a whole assortment of Fireworks, like Cherry Bombs, M80\u2019s, Screamers, Roman Candles and the Blockbuster Fireworks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can also use the worlds natural Piping System, Springs and Trapdoors to help you navigate successfully through the world, but watch out for natural hazards like Dripping Pipes, Water Pools, Falling Iron Blocks and Crushers that are instant death to your kind.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlso keep a close eye on your health, for Normal White Ice will cost you 1 Unit of Health the clear, while the dreaded Hard Blue Ice will cost you 2 units of health, unless you are in your temporary super-hot Blue Fire Sprite state. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHealth can be replenished by collecting the many Fire Gems throughout each level or by way of the Gas Cans found throughout the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow, before your start playing you might want to take some time to play the Tutorial levels.  These will give you a better understanding of how things work, but it is not required.  Also, if you ever get trapped in the game, and you will, just restart the level from the Pause Menu to try again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no penalty for restarting any level, but you only have 3 lives to finish with.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T05:32:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfd/bfdb6cceccadab1b6de675d4164f2a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["William Anderson"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awaken Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
