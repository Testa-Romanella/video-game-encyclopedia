Inspired by the movie Dawn of the Dead, you get to control a dog and save people from zombies in a mall. It's about a minute of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I encountered a bug which I wasn't able to fix in time. The screen flickers on start. If you move the character the flickering stops. My apologies.</p>\n<p>Controls are left mouse button to interact with objects. D or right arrow to move forward, A or left arrow to move backwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by Remy Smit.
