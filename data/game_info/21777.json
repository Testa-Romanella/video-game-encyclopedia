He decided to start up his old and trusty eight-bit console to remember the good times he had when he was just a little kid, but when he puts in the cartridge, 8BitBoy gets sucked into the game&#39;s world.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>8BitBoy is an homage to the old NES-era games (mainly platformers). It is heavily inspired by titles like Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and Mega Man, featuring numerous game designing elements present in these games.</p>\n<p>While still being an eighties classic platformer, the developers made several additions to the basic gameplay formula. The players still have to get to the end of the level untouched, as any contact with the enemies will kill them and reset the level back to the beginning. The enemies are killed by jumping on top of their heads. This applies to every enemy present in the game, either a basic sentry or the final boss. The players can also pick up a special power-up that will allow them to shoot projectiles that ricochet off the walls, but this power-up can be used only for a limited amount of time.</p>\n<p>There are five worlds present in the game with each world consisting of 10 levels and featuring its own art style and environment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T15:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d647d253e133e8d3d6111ab412edda.jpg", "website": "http://awesomeblade.com/8BitBoy/index.htm", "rating": 1.87, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 44, "owned": 1123, "beaten": 8, "dropped": 24, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 51, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 55, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AwesomeBlade"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AwesomeBlade"], "esrb_rating": null}
