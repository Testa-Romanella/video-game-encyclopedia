The idea was to challange us to really get into code programming. Well, in the\u00a0 end, we had to cut down and ended up doing a flappy bird clone ... with purple rain. The player character is supposed to be Prince's head. Of course we had to cut the original song for this upload, but if you wanna flap through some Purple rain properly, just mute the audio of the game and hit play on that old Prince record we all know you still have somewhere.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efba1fae3c7416c25245b4e4b0adcb10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rue"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
