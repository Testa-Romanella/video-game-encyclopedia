You can create a character, pick one of three character classes, and level-up your skills by using them in any situation that requires them. <br/><br/>In Adventurer, you are thrust into a world where you, the player, can talk to NPCs, buy items from NPCs, pick up quests from NPCs and get rewarded for your hard work. <br/><br/>Because this is a test-build, I have a Google Forms document for you to use to present your feedback to me: https://forms.gle/boJEQmG1FVZcd4k76<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Sprint</p>\n<p>I - Inventory</p>\n<p>R - Sheathe/Unsheate weapon (equip in inventory first)</p>\n<p>F - Interact (Initate dialogue, buy/sell in bartering, equip/unequip item, consume item)</p>\n<p>J - Access Quest Log</p>\n<p>C - Access Character Details menu</p>\n<p>P - Access Pause Menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T07:19:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c5420d3baeb3c3948d1251cb1d0f799.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Reece Tarrant"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
