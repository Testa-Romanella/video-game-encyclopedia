In it, you play as a vigilante trying to stop a murder that she knows is going to happen. <br/><br/>Thematically, the correlation to the theme goes a lot deeper than just the title. We won't spoil how, you'll have to find out for yourself! <br/><br/>The game was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 28 by Chris Klassen and Justin Wang of Magnesium Ninja, with music by <strong>Abstraction</strong> at https://soundcloud.com/abstraction (Made during the first 48 hours for participants). </p><p>Thanks for playing! Let us know what you think :)</p><p><em>Original Release Date: December 16, 2013</em></p><strong>Post-mortem Commentary:</strong><p>Our first and only visual novel project. Scrambling to get this done in 72 hours was a lot of fun in itself, and we hope you enjoy the final product.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d5e6fcf96878be56f9d6b360b60cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magnesium Ninja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
