When there are WebGL embed issues, the embed resolution will be updated.</p>\n<p>The Kidnapping of the Damsel was created by a team of<strong> two programmers</strong>,\u00a0<strong>two pixel artists</strong>,\u00a0<strong>two level designers</strong>,\u00a0<strong>and 1 sound designer</strong> (as well as\u00a0<strong>several test players</strong>).\u00a0 The game may have bugs that will be updated in the future.\u00a0The background story of the game is as follows:</p>\n<p>Many years before the story takes place, the humans and giant birds were in a great war. After finally coming to peace, the two species had to come up with something that would help them bond and continue the peace. This is how the ritual of The Kidnapping of the Damsel was born. Every year, a male and female pair of names is drawn. Once the two get picked, the female is \"kidnapped\" by the birds, and the male has a quest of going after her to \"save\" her. The ritual is meant to have the two bond, and in the future get married.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nLiteHouse Studios Team\r\n<ul><li>Programmers: Light,\u00a0Dessey, Palatinate</li><li>Pixel Artists: Shana_Waffles, sovrapple</li><li>Level Designers:\u00a0R9, Eren Can Baydur</li><li>Sound Design: Headphone Headache</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf65cdb8e20847488c7ec41eeeaacf44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shana_waffles", "Headphone Headache", "R9_", "Dessey", "sovrapple"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
