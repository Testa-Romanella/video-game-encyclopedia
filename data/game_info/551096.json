The level is procedurally generated but the game does not feature level generation, even though it would be cool I thought that it is not the point. Personally, I could float around in the level for hours, but I think that I had to add collecting stuff to make more than just a virtual toy. Making a WebGL build was also a last-minute decision to make the game more accessible. Lighting is a bit broken in it, but it does the job for the most part.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T08:25:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c11/c113ffa71e7c9db9151e8580f615c729.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sensei Fry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
