Unlike traditional games in the genre, in Blitz Guard, <strong>you won't rely on healing items</strong>. Instead, you must explore the world in search of one-time-use healing fountains, adding an element of resource management and tactical strategy to your gameplay.<h3>Different than other souls-like games</h3><br/><br/>Rather than relying on a shield, <strong>you will depend on your skill and reflexes to evade enemy attacks or perform parries</strong> with your sword.

This additional challenge consists of 51 consecutive rooms filled with relentless enemies.
