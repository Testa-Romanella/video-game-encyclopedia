For this purpose it is necessary to place the cubes and platforms so as to be able to get to the portal. A distinctive feature of our hero is the aura of time, which helps to move the platform and cubes to reach the goal. When an object enters the field of aura, he begins to spend the allotted time on the movement. To recharge time is needed to collect teeth - time vessels. After the resulting time aura loses its ability to move objects, and using all the tooth needs to start the level again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-15T02:11:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/840/840bc1f5093c66d754411ea1e450c8b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laush Dmitriy Sergeevich"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Laush Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
