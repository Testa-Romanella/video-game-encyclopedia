Slick\u2019s the dexterous one, Hefty\u2019s the muscle. Both like to think of themselves as the brain of the operation (neither are). For complicated reasons their ball chain is \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 a bomb that starts burning whenever it touches the ground. You\u2019ll have to navigate them safely to Mexico without the bomb blowing up in your face. Good luck!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>\n</p>\n<p>One player controls Slick, the other Hefty. \r\n  A single player can control both to proof their ambidextrous abilities. You can move, jump and pick up / throw the bomb. The bomb will light the fuse whenever isn\u2019t carried and explode after a few seconds. Slick can jump higher but does not fit through all passages (tall people don\u2019t duck). He\u2019s also fairly weak. Hefty is strong enough to carry and throw the bomb without issues but can\u2019t jump as high. Navigate the jumping-puzzles on your way to freedom!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Keybindings are explained in-game. You can play the game with up to two gamepads. If no gamepads are connected, players rub elbows on a single keyboard. Gamepads are only recognized on startup!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The story so far</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Slick and Hefty knew their plan was foolproof: 1. Disguise a bomb as ball chain 2. Smuggle it into the prison 3. Blow up the walls 4. Freedom awaits! Or rather, awaited. What they didn\u2019t expect was to be chained to the exact same bomb and be sent off to chain gang duty. But if Slicky and Hefty know one thing it\u2019s improvisation and running away. And now they are indeed on the run, chained to each other and the temperamental bomb that brings them together.
