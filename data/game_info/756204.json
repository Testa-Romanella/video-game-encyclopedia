This time, I have created a Virtual Reality immersive experience that discusses the concept of \"pursuit\". This piece is the part-2 for the concept. Part-1 is a video piece.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For me, I believe that the more I want something, the less likely I can get it. However, if I remain static and be focusing on myself, things I want would come to me. <strong>ABOVE IS A SPOILER TO WIN\u00a0THE GAME LOL.\u00a0</strong>I hope this short but concise piece could bring you something to think about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I developed this experience with Oculus Quest 2, Oculus Link, and Steam VR. I believe you would be able to enjoy if all the apps and cables are properly set up. Even though I used Oculus Quest 2, other headsets would work as well. Final reminder: just make sure steam VR is running and recognizing your headset!</p>\n<p>If you are interested in my process or more of my work, feel free to follow my instagram.\u00a0Thank you very much!</p>\n<p>\u8981/Pursuit II - 2022.3<br/>Format: Virtual Reality Interactive Experience<br/><br/>Supervised and inspired by Jonathan William Turner.<br/><br/>Game Engine:\u00a0#unreal<br/>Modeling:\u00a0#blender<br/>Demo headset:\u00a0#oculusquest2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T10:41:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b343f7f3f1f34626fea4964b3269dda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["farronmoremore"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
