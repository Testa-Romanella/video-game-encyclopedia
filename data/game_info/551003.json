From your parents, you know that your grandfather has not moved and decided to stay. He presumably got exclusive knowledge on how people can survive when he died in his house.\u00a0</p><p>The connection between the Earth and Mars has been lost. For a number of years, you were not capable of getting to Earth. Finally, the means of transportation were found and you managed to arrive. It is still dangerous to stay here for a long time, however. So, you are planning to see how your ancestor was living and finally find his message.\u00a0</p><p>Hurry up, try to find as many artifacts of his tremendous life that were lost in this house, and do not forget that your ultimate goal is to get a letter with the message found. Good luck! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T08:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/1316435a5688a8e82a67d75b88b29783.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["kolebas", "eduardseregine@gmail.com"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
