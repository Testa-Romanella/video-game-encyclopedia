You're just an astronaut but they'll kill if you let them. Make sure to dodge every bullet and every alien to make sure you stay alive.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>This game uses the basic 8D-movement controls, so:</p>\n<ul><li>W - Go up;</li><li>S - Go down;</li><li>A - Go to the left;</li><li>D - Go to the right;</li></ul>\n<ul><li>SPACE - Pause.</li></ul>\n<p>*Probably* coming in the next updates</p>\n<p>As I said I'm having lots of fun with this little project so I might add a thing or two here and there, such as:</p>\n<ul><li>More enemies;</li><li>New mechanics (shop &amp; coins idk??);</li><li>Rounds;</li><li>Bosses;</li><li>New attacks;</li><li><strong>Music.</strong></li></ul>\n<p><em>More to be done.</em></p>\n<p>Version 1.1.0.0. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e9bd86947c85ec904e14e08d44b8de7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vhstudio85"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
