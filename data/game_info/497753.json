It's a simple and fun frenetic twin-stick shooter.\u00a0 It's the kind of game I would've designed for the Atari 2600 when I was 5 years old, if I could've.</p>\n<p>Simply download and unzip 'ZZAP.ZIP', and play 'ZZAP.EXE'.<br/></p>\n<p>You pilot mankinds's last, best starfighter. In a hyperspace subdimension far removed from Einsteinian physics, you must hold back a flood of vicious aliens and their hostile technologies. As you destroy the horde, your score (and multiplier) increases, but so does your enemy's effort to destroy you, as they send new creatures and ships against you: Enemy ships can be docile and aimless, or aggressively fire weapons of their own. Some pursue you when angered, or become more dangerous when killed. Others recklessly explode when activated by a nearby starfighter - can you use this to your advantage?<br/></p>\n<p>More kills means a higher score multiplier, but don't get hit! You'll lose a life and halve your multiplier. Grab powerups to boost Points and Multiplier further, enhance your Laser to cope with the onslaught, or detonate a Bomb to buy a second of breathing space. Score high enough and you might even get an extra life.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>MOVE SHIP: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WASD or LEFT STICK<br/></p>\n<p>AIM: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MOUSE or RIGHT STICK</p>\n<p>FIRE:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 LEFT MOUSE BUTTON or RIGHT STICK</p>\n<p>PAUSE: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ESC or START<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:03:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f0314fd132b7fd907be7069ee12d0afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeonRetroTech"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
