I jam with a lot of ambition and work to the deadline without worrying much about what players will get. This has some rough edges for sure. If you feel like like this is empty or there is nothing to do, that is normal and fair.</p><p>This game has automatic networked multi-player. A player leaving can reset the game sometimes, and i'm not sure what will happen if too many players connect.</p><p>The players all use the same model (several options are planned).</p><p>You pillow fight with the monster who piggy-backs around on you. pillow-fighting increases everyone's speed and jump strength.</p><p>It's all for fun. No sound or objectives.</p><p>Expect a post-jam version and feel free to pressure me @kenruze</p><p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/788/7886b579a183f4fc70b31c34a0c8d806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elliott Davis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
