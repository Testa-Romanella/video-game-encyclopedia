When I saw the theme was growth, the first thing that came to mind was a platformer that used 'growing' platforms as a mechanic. After checking the available assets, I decided on mushrooms at the platform material, mainly because it was the only practical choice. Its also the first time I've created a platformer like this, so proved a fun challenge.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Visual Assets: Kenney.nl</li><li>Music: Juhani Junkala (https://opengameart.org/content/4-chiptunes-adventure)</li><li>Font: Zyzol by \u00a0Szymon Furjan (https://www.fontspace.com/zyzol-font-f67557)</li><li>Growth sfx: Almitory (https://opengameart.org/content/digging-underground)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5eb87aff09356105433b05cd2a9b30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MattBann"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
