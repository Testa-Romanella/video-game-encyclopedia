It uses Active/Wait turn based combat and has part of an original story. It is currently in development and will be actively updated as feedback comes in.</p>\n<p>This demo is to see if making a full game is worth it. It is currently still being updated, but I need playtesters to find bugs and help balance things. There are currently a fair amount of problems still, but I'm looking for big issues.</p>\n<p>Currently working on implementing dragonbones enemies, I have a few already, but they are simple ones.</p>\n<p>Please provide any feedback you may have good or bad, both are helpful in shaping the game. Thank you.</p>\n<p>If you want to support me in updating the demo/making the full game you can go to my Patreon.</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/Slakarot<br/></p>\n\n<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p>\n<p>There are only three quests implemented at this time, this was me testing the waters and making sure it works correctly, I'm still ironing out the process</p>\n<p>There are animation issues with some attacks, I will be addressing those soon</p>\n<p>The options menu isn't as easy to find as it should be, but is very important. I will try to make it more clear.</p>\n<p>Text overlap issues with UI in and out of battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/636d7057adf9cf729cf977113b7e6faf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slakarot"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
