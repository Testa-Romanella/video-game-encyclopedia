Check out my second one, Arizona Craters, here.<br/></p>\n<p>If you like my work, please consider supporting me on Patreon.<br/></p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Update (3/17/17): Version 1.1</p>\n<p>- Added some text to the game's endings.</p>\n<p>- A few new art CGs, mainly for Richard.</p>\n<p>- Still trying to find a way for the player to save their game, a feature pyopyon pointed out is lacking.  Hoping to have that in a 1.2.</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Version 1.2 is released! (3/23/17)</p>\n<p>- The text has been polished all around.  That includes fixing all the typos &amp; misspellings I could find.  If there are any left over, please let me know &amp; I'll take 'em out asap!</p>\n<p>- The game now has a proper icon!  It can also be found at the beginning and end of the game.</p>\n<p>- Unfortunately, I could not find a way for the player to save their game (if I don't want my GUI to break apart, at least).  So sorry, players!</p>\n<p>- I'm considering writing some short epilogues for the characters, which can be unlocked at certain endings.  Would you want to read that?  If so, anything you'd really want to see?</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Update (3/30/17) GIVE IT TIME 1.21: Fixed a bug in Richard's second narration; thanks to Bluebirdplays for pointing it out to me.</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Update (11/6/17):\u00a0The game is now at 1.3!\u00a0 Read more about the update here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/678/678fa1d2cf78b871e40ddc3e2879b8bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Naomi Norbez"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
