The goal of this game is to shoot the skinny enemies, while avoiding the big enemies. The big enemies are immune to your shots. The little enemies will give you points every time you destroy one.\u00a0When the game is over, an alert displaying your score will show up. Press enter to close it, then press enter again to replay.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>This is a game I developed for a challenge I'm doing. The challenge is to develop increasingly complex games with each game I make. At first I was just limiting my pixel art and button count, but then decided I wanted to go one step further and limit my file sizes and other system related things\u00a0as well.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Github:\u00a0https://github.com/acenettner/JumpShot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T20:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1c5760536437df601e2636b191b1d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ace Nettner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
