You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.<br />\nTo get past security, you&#39;ll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.Key Features Rewire levels to work however you want<br />\nTrick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other<br />\nThrow yourself - and others - through plate glass windows<br />\nInvestigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions<br />\nChoose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them<br />\nChoose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination<br />\nDiscover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of<br />\nBuy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play<br />\nAll story stuff is skippable<br />\nHardest puzzles are optional<br />\nNo bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2013-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T21:30:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a12/a12eecf2feb2df9ceedd6e36ba758245.jpg", "website": "http://www.gunpointgame.com/", "rating": 4.03, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 160, "owned": 2138, "beaten": 273, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 71, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 288, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 291, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Suspicious Developments"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Suspicious Developments"], "esrb_rating": null}
