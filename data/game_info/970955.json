Its primary objective was to terraform and pre-establish a settlement for humans on the 4th planet in the Vega star system, over 25 light years from Earth. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe ship took 41 years to arrive at Vega 4. Upon reaching the planet the AI determined that it could be terraformed and a signal was transmitted back to Earth to send a colony ship to arrive 200 years later. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the terraforming activity, the AI\u2019s directives were overwritten and it began to develop weapons technology. It spread over the entire planet in an effort to prevent humanity from inhabiting the planet. Terminals were constructed to control the weapons and defenses, and to store resources and power. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnknowingly to the AI, another AI subroutine activated in one of the terminals. Completely independent from the central, corrupted AI, this new entity had a new objective: to ensure that mankind safely reaches Vega 4. This subroutine is you and you must take back the planet at all costs.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures<br/>\r\nProcedurally generated hex tile maps<br/>\r\nReal-time battles<br/>\r\nExpand and manage bases<br/>\r\n25+ mission campaign<br/>\r\nRandomly generated skirmish battles<br/>\r\nExtensive map editor", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T00:41:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/4988cbcb927a0ed9d54f985cb745a06a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Infinite Loop Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Infinite Loop Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
