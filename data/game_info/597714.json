Ravaged and consumed by monsters, there is only desolation and ruins. Among the doom, you discover a seed and with it, a desire to see this hope grow amongst the wasteland.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>AD - Left-right movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>DEVELOPER\u00a0RAMBLE\u00a0NOTES</p>\n<p>First things first, I am not an artist or animator. It was by my insistence on creating my own assets that led to my downfall of having to repeatedly fix my assets because I kept realising how broken they were thus costing me time. I learnt a lot of valuable lessons during this project and I'm happy to have finished the main idea quite literally seconds before submission closed. I also used Godot to put this together an engine I haven't had much experience with so this was my first proper project that I committed to. There was a lot of learning done over the past 48 hours, a lot of corners crossed and the perfectionist within me is screaming beyond measure.\u00a0</p><p>My ambition for the project (should I continue it) would be the following:</p><p>- Introduce multiple ways of gathering water</p><p>- Introduce resource scarcity</p><p>- Implement enemies that would begin attacking once the tree gets to a certain size and then increasing as the tree gets bigger and attracts more attention</p><p>- Crafting defenses, buildings. I did make a waterpump asset that never got added because of time but that was another method of gathering water</p><p>- The ability to move the treepot, at least when it's small, of course it would get heavier as it gets bigger so at some point, you wouldn't be able to move it</p><p>All in all, I'd like to make it more of a survival game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7c8f030f6d2515735bc29451475db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phanatik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
