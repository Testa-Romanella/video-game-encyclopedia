My section's focus was on creating a system to implement \"dancing\" animation for the player to then mimic using the phones gyroscope; which by the end of my time developing with them, was working. All that was left was to assemble the various dances that the player would have to mimic. This feature/mechanic became part of the other cut content as the use of hardware and direction of the game didn't match with the core functionality of the mechanic.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T04:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db87b0d4b632bbe5a63b7127ccb3469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Forkey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
