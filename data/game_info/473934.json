There is also a 'scripts only' zip that has just the code to read if you're not interested in opening it in Unity.</p>\n<p>I have heavily commented the code and am proud of the backend enhancements I made over the original tutorial presented in the course, so please take a look! I especially would like fellow course members and other new Unity coders to see it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Using an object pool and event-driven code is probably overkill for something this small, but I'm really interested in those concepts and wanted to put them into action. I'm very proud of the result.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with Unity 2018.4.25f1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:08:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b6/2b6917dd36a7a5c963215ee88393289f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["technitaur"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
