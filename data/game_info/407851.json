Try not to fall out of the stage, if you collide with red walls you lose and the game restarts.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse button: Roll to the right.</p>\n<p>Right mouse button: Flip gravity</p>\n<p>Middle mouse button (scroll button): Reset the game</p>\n<p>Press escape to exit the game.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:19:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/526ecd71efa3caa29b4db8cbcf66e09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dannimb"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
