Lightly themed as a dungeon exploration with geometric enemies, the gameplay centers around a time-stop ability, during which you can plan out moves and shots. Moving, shooting, and being hit cost energy, which can be regained from dead enemies along with powerful upgrades. These affect many aspects of your character, and can be customized between increasingly difficult levels. </strong></p><p><strong>This game was developed in about a month for a game development class at NYU, under the tutelage of Robert Yang.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/961/961b34bf22a42a5f56e48a98e2af7ac2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["oligb7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
