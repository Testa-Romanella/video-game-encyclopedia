The paddles move so slowly that if you're awake, you can't ever lose. But that's the thrill of pong, isn't it? Just like wrestling, or tic-tac-toe, or bench-pressing, pong is about keeping up constant vigilance and strength.</p><p>Play with a friend (or simply amuse yourself). The left paddle is controlled by \"w\" and \"s\" while the right paddle is controlled by [up] and [down]. Seriously. There is no gimmick. There is nothing special about this game. It's literally just boring pong.
