I discovered the ability to write VNs a couple weeks ago and thought I'd give it a try.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm definitely going to keep working on making these. I highly enjoy this medium in which one can\u00a0tell a story that has audio cues go along with it and the player immersion is a fun aspect.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated. I think for the near future I'll be leaning more towards writing novels that are more heavy on story that one can immerse themselves through reading and listening, rather than by making too many choices the player interacts with.</p>\n<p>If you think this one sucks, great! We have something in common. I come from a storytelling background so I'm not great with coding. Looking to collaborate with someone savvy on the technical side, while I can write characters, story, and dialogue.</p>\n<p>Like I didn't even bother updating the main menu beyond music and a picture... I didn't change the application icon... This is literally just to get my tiptoes wet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm also not an 'artist' so the sprites and backgrounds were generated using whatever free software I had at my fingertips... well Google's fingertips.\u00a0All are credited in the 'ABOUT' section. Looking to work with artists in the future once I'm able to pay them for their hardwork and talent.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this section. I love you. Like no really... I LOVE YOU. Enjoy, be safe. Wrap yourself up in fuzzy feelings and good vibes. Be safe, be healthy, be well and have fun... but not too much fun. I don't like it when people have fun without me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T05:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65e/65ede148e7399650fb5d4667eadbe2ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pumky"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
