This was a \"quick\" game I felt like making to challenge myself, if it feels cut short, it's because I could no longer challenge myself, I was only making simple 3d models, and my specialty is more of coding.\u00a0 It might not be as grand, or as long as getting over it which I will admit I was using as reference, but it's cool I guess. I cut this short as I could no longer challenge myself with low poly models and a tiny bit of playmaker code. If people like this for some reason, then I might add more to it, but for now, this is what I've got.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T10:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40c/40c29731842acaf4c82ff48db0241a88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tamer1012"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
