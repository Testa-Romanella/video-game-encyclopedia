Follow the path of the swamp, talk to some of the locals, and collect all of the lollipops! If all the lollipops are gathered and brought to the elder, you will have an offering to give to heroes that are needed in these desperate times since the swamp has recently been under attack by the Mega Frog!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This was a short game I made over the past month and a half to help practice my skills in the Unity Engine. I've spent most of my time developing 2D games in the Godot Engine, but recently decided to try out 3D modeling and Unity so this could be seen as a small demo of what I've learned over the past few months!</p>\n\n<p>Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. There is also a Windows Installer option if you'd like to install the game instead of downloading a zip.</p>\n\n<p>Notice any bugs or want to provide feedback? Leave it in the comments below!
