If a missile is being raised it will flash red. If the missile has been launched the circle will be solid red. You raise a missile by going up to it and holding the F key. You will see the missile being raised while doing so. If you let go it will fall twice as fast as it raised.</p>\n<p>The first missile takes 25 seconds to raise, the second 20 seconds, and the final one 15 seconds. Multiple people raising a missile at the same time speeds up the time it takes.</p>\n<p>In Package Delivery:<br/>The objective of the game is to pick up the package which will be at the white star on the minimap. Once you pick it up you will see a green circle on the minimap that you need to drop the package off at. If the star is flashing red the enemy has the package and you need to stop them before they drop it off at their designated spot. If the star is green one of your team mates has the package. Help them delivery it by killing enemies trying to stop them.</p>\n<p>Once the package is delivered a new one will parachute into the level.</p>\n<p>Bomb Disposal:<br/>The objective in bomb disposal is to disarm bombs in the office if you are on the offensive team or keep the other team from disarming the bombs if you are on the defensive team.</p>\n<p>Bombs are marked on the map by green circles. If a bomb is being disarmed it will flash red. If the bomb has been disarmed the circle will be solid red. You disarm a bomb by going up to it and holding the F key. If you let go the disarm time will increase twice as fast as it took to disarm the bomb.</p>\n<p>The first Bomb takes 25 seconds to disarm, the second 20 seconds, and the final one 15 seconds. Multiple people disarming a bomb at once speeds up the disarm time.</p>\n<p>In Team Deathmatch your team is trying to kill as many enemies as possible.</p>\n<p>In pistol deathmatch everyone is on their own and only has pistols.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS:</strong><br/>When you respawn you will be invulnerable for 10 seconds. Your healthbar will be purple while you are invulnerable.</p>\n<p>Each weapon has a different strength versus weakness in terms of range, damage, clip size, fire rate, etc.</p>\n<p>Head shots do 2 times damage.</p>\n<p>The RPG with a green missile head is unguided but does more damage.<br/>The Guided missile will track a vehicle, just aim at a vehicle until the red square says locked and then fire. The missile will track towards the enemy until it hits or runs out of fuel. Missiles can be dodged only be a helicopter if it releases a flare. Helicopters only have three flares and then they take 45 seconds to reload.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only the RPG, the guided missile, the Minigun, and vehicle weapons can damage a tank. All AR/Sniper/Rifle weapons can damage an APC or helicopter but the rifles do reduced damage against those vehicles.</p>\n<p>Look for ladders in the level. Ladders can be climbed to get to places you normally can't. Also look for objects you can jump onto that will allow you to get to higher areas.</p>\n<p><strong>PERFORMANCE:</strong><br/>To get best performance make sure you do not have a lot of tabs open. Ideally only have the game as the only tab open and run full screen (F11 for chrome). You can also turn on/off graphics options from the main menu by clicking on the gear icon/symbol.</p>\n<p><strong>CONNECTION:</strong><br/>Make sure you whitelist the servers for the game if you have adblockers or script blockers so you can connect to them. The game has no ads in it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d679a9462ed8d816de0d20d71149b6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Warbrokers", "mark_treb", "marvin_treb"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
