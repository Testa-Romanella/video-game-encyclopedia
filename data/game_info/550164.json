Some of the hay bales (which are heavy... do not get crushed!) are covered in cream. They are white until you lick the cream off them (you are a dog). Don't let the cream bales get away! If the cream bales fall into the void with the cream still on them, you lose a life. Watch out for other objects, too! w,a,s,d to move, space to jump, mouse to look around, and left-click to lick! Be a good dog and have fun!</p><p>I made this game for the Curdle Jam #10 in three days. Music loops from Garageband. Game over music by Phillip Schlosser (youtube).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T04:39:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe186f86eafb590047308faab39663e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itchy_programmer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
