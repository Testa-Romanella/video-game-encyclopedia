Played in a first-person perspective, the player takes on the role of protagonist Cole, a man that travels to unhallowed grounds in hopes of saving his brother Jace. Crippled by debt, Jace has been blinded by the pursuit of payout collecting untouched gold deposits, only to fall into the hands of accursed mass murderer Ira King. Despite his noble intentions, Cole has become ensnared in a game of cat and mouse with Ira in an arrangement that will bring about the end.WHERE AM I?The map is procedurally generated, spawn points are random but around the center of the traversable area. There is no escape because Votaries have cursed the land and their enchantment has trapped you forever. You will never feel safe.WHAT DO I DO?Stay alive, find Jace and collect what gold you can.<br/><br/>You only have a compass, rifle and a set amount of ammunition so be careful, because every decision you make will impact your chances of survival.LONG LIVE THE KINGYour death will come swiftly, Ira King will make sure of it.<br/><br/>Discover helpful tips to defeat Ira within memoirs which detail how he came to be.<br/>Keep moving and stay focused because he always knows where you are.SACRIFICEThe Votaries give Ira strength, they will not harm you but killing them will slow Ira in his hunt for your life. Built by the Votaries, there are three pillars in the map that can be activated by offering dismembered limbs of Ira's victims. Once all the pillars have been activated or all the Votaries have been killed, Ira is at his most vulnerable state.SPENDING THE SPOILSIncrease your chances of survival by spending gold found throughout the game. Your greed may reward you with the ability to purchase extra ammunition or new weapon skins. However, remember that every second you spend collecting gold is a second closer to your potential death.<br/><br/><br/><strong>NOTICE</strong><br/>For optimal playing conditions, we recommend that Make a Killing is played wearing headphones in a dark room with the gamma setting adjusted correctly. Jumpscares have not been designed into the game, but death sequences are fast and come from any direction, so we recommend caution while playing. The game does not and will not include any microtransactions and any future downloadable content will be free.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f9ad9cc7439dc51b53d9d9195ec5e95.jpg", "website": "https://makeakilling.dysive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Dystopia Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dystopia Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
