{"id": 118971, "slug": "cyberjack", "name": "CyberJack", "name_original": "CyberJack", "description": "<p> CyberJack is my first completed game (ever) as well as my entry into the #cyberpunkJam here on Itch.io (itch.io/jam/cyberpunkjam).</p><p>Everything was \"hand crafted\" using freely available tools. There are some bugs and graphical issues here and there, but overall I feel it was a good success and I learned a ton over the course of just a few days.</p><p>Update: Cyberjack V5 was a remake of the original game idea using Pico-8. Although not the game I submitted to the cyberpunkjam, I tried to stay true to the original design. As time has gone on the original game has become unplayable and this is the best way I can find to keep my first ever game AND jam entry alive. <br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>Press Z to start or X to view instructions and High Score. Press Z to go back to main menu.</p><p>Once in game press X to connect/disconnect. (Costs 800c)<br/>Use arrow keys to select what you want to access. Press Z to access.<br/>Try to build up as much money as you can without the time running out.</p><p>Avoid green folders or you lose cash.<br/>A key can be found once per connect and is random.
