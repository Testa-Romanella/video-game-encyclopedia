If this happens to you, please use Firefox or download the native version of the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>INTRO</strong>:</p>\n<p>Join little red riding hood as she attempts to visit her grandmother deep in the forest. Many enemies and obstacles block the way, meaning that Red needs to create a path in order to make it deeper and deeper as the days go by. Luckily you can receive help from other players in a \u201cstrand-like\u201d way, meaning that paths and structures placed by other players can appear in your world, just like how your structures can appear in future or current\u00a0players\u2019. Make sure not to stay out too long to avoid the knife wolves and enjoy getting deeper and deeper into the forest until you make it to the end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys or WASD to move</li><li>SPACE,\u00a0 X, or left click to attack in your current direction</li><li>Z, F, or Y to place or interact with currently equipped structure</li><li>C or E to cycle currently selected structure</li><li>Shift to run</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>ITEMS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Torch - Creates light.
