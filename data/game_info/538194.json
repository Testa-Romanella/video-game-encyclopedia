We leverage VR technology and game design techniques in an entertaining and educational VR experience, where users play the role of researchers who visit an environmental engineering and sustainability laboratory. They will experience a series of games and acquire knowledge about water, energy, urbanization, and ecosystem services throughout the journey. Meanwhile, our game demonstrates population and water demand shifts through a multi-decade period from the Texas Metro Observatory (TMO) project, as shown in the picture below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>\n<p>The Planet Texas 2050 VR Futures team would like to thank:</p>\n<ul><li>Dr. Fernanda Leite: Project Lead</li><li>Megan Johns: Co-Project Lead</li><li>Andrew Solis: Co-Project Lead</li><li>Bing Han: Lead Developer and Programmer</li><li>Jeshua Johnson: VR Programmer and Designer</li><li>Lori VanHoose: 3D Modeler, Texture Artist, and Audio Editor</li><li>Olivia Moriarty: Designer/Programmer and Narrator</li><li>Daniel Weeks: 360 Video Creator and Programmer</li><li>Dr. Eduardo Isatto: Technical Advisor</li></ul>\n<p>Learn more about Planet Texas here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Research from Texas Metro Observatory (TMO) and\u00a0Transportation-Related Air Pollution\u00a0(TRAP).</p>\n<p>Game Assets Used :</p>\n<ul><li>Flasks</li><li>Skybox</li><li>SteamVR</li><li>Fish</li><li>PC Setup</li><li>Office Supplies</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Game Setup</strong></p>\n<p>Please set up your VR system with SteamVR.
