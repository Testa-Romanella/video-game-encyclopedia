An intermission in the form of a trip to a nearby vending machine goes awry when a purchased drink gets stuck in the drink dispenser. Experience the extreme, overwhelming, and mostly unnecessary spiraling of someone who just wants to get their work done while those around them question their mental stability!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made for the NaNoRenO 2022 game jam. It\u2019s a short little narrative that uses its small scope to test various features that will hopefully land in a larger game. Regardless of that, I hope it\u2019s still enjoyable! Thank you as always for playing, and of course, please also check out the other entries for NaNoRenO 2022 by clicking the tab on the right!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T10:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94d/94dc9574431530f19b00b6c4782436f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
