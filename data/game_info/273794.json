Everyone has an important surgery that needs to be done, and you need to decide which one is more important than the others. In surgery, you have to complete the right procedure. If you kill a patient in surgery, you lose 3 lives, if a patient dies in the waiting room, you lose 2 lives, if you successfully treat a patient, you gain a life. You have 20 lives to lose before you are fired. Your score is how many patients you successfully treat total.
