The aim of the game is to remove all cards by pairing off cards that total 13. An Ace is worth 1, a Jack 11 and a Queen 12 so that possible pairs are as follows:<br/><br/>Ace + Queen<br/>2 + Jack<br/>3 + 10<br/>4 + 9<br/>5 + 8<br/>6 + 7<br/>K : worth 13 and can be discarded on its own<br/><br/>Double-tap the top card of the stock pile to move it on to the waste pile and hence step through the stock. Cards can be paired off from the pyramid, or from pyramid + stock, pyramid + waste or stock + pyramid. Only completely uncovered cards in the pyramid are available.<br/><br/>Once you have been through the stock and exhausted all possible moves, you are allowed at least one redeal, in which the waste is gathered up and re-dealt on to the stock pile to go through again.<br/><br/>The app contains two versions: '1 redeal' and '2 redeal', where you are allowed to re-deal 1 or 2 times respectively.<br/><br/>For the complete set of 20 solitaire games, see \"Solitaire Whizz\" in the app store or visit http://www.solitairewhizz.com/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:04:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/54624ce9237e78f24f72ac0afbe76aa0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Neil Coffey"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Neil Coffey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
