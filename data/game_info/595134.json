Hidden deep  in the forest, the only way back is to follow the river. The river may  be the fastest way but it's full of rocks and trees that momma bird must  avoid if she want to make it back in one piece. Hunger is also an issue  on this trek, and she must eat many bugs of the bugs found along the  river in order to stave off starvation. The bugs also make her heavier,  making flight a little more difficult! This game was made for  LudumDare48 in 72 hours.
