I did reuse some bits of code from some previous games I worked on.\u00a0 But all the models and graphics were created specifically for this game. \u00a0(I did use some textures from textures.com.)</p><p>(Oops, wait, I take that back. \u00a0I did reuse one model from my last game jam entry, but that was done as an intentional callback.)<br/></p><p>Oh... heck, I forgot to mention this in the in-game controls, but if you end up with some weird camera angle after changing the camera angle by clicking and dragging, you can reset the camera by double-clicking.</p><p>I made a post about the creation of this game on my gamedev blog.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T08:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5264960c9f6db22d8e639ee2359843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Miskin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
