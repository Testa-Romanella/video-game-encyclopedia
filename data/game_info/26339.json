Choose from a variety of \n      beat and tempo settings and three designs.<br/>The Nintendo DSi \n      Metronome software can be used to help keep tempo\u2014when playing an \n      instrument, for example. It creates a rhythm by playing sounds based on \n      beat and tempo settings, which both allow a wide range of possible \n      adjustments. In addition, choose from three metronome designs (including \n      one based on Nintendo\u2019s Game &amp; Watch: Ball title!) and record your own \n      beat sounds for the metronome to use. Or, if you want to take a break, \n      enjoy a unique minigame: Donkey Kong Metronome, in which you make sounds \n      into the microphone to match the beat and have Mario jump over Donkey \n      Kong\u2019s barrels.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eac/eaccd1314c893ead67e2abf8f5448674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
