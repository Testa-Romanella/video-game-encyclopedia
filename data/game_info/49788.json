You can create and influence the history in the land of Abella and have those events ripple through eternity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Begin your journey by stepping into an enormous 21x21km, fully realized world, complete with naturalistic weather, day-night cycles, and changing seasons. Various areas produce differing amounts of region-specific resources, while the weather alternates throughout the land, and can play a vital role in successful crop growth and availability of natural resources. Each region can offer unique advantages and favorable conditions for brave adventurers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore a vast world; choose a suitable location for your humble home, walled city or strapping fort. Level and terraform to perfect the area before getting to work. Set out to meet new friends and forge alliances with neighbors \u2014 imagine the possibilities with a team of people. Excluding the starting city, everything will be built by you - the players, as you cooperate to build majestic kingdoms and thriving communities.    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Kingdoms will rise and kingdoms will fall. The pen can be mightier than the sword if wielded properly. Guild holdings can turn into towns; towns into cities and cities into kingdoms, stretching across the land. Do you have what it takes to form coalitions and alliances to defend your lands and rule over Abella?<br/><br/><br/><br/>When diplomacy fails, it is time to reach for the sword. During this era, there was always that bright, shining light of peace and prosperity, but, alas, civilizations were usually mired in the dark, brutal and often violent reality of medieval life. Take up arms against your foes, utilizing the non-target, physics-based combat system. With realistic player damage you can create deadly combos to deliver bleeding wounds and fractured bones, and in the end... conquer the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Establish yourself as an entrepreneur; watch your wealth and influence grow as you build an empire with a completely realistic economy. Barter for goods with others through player-built trading posts across the world. Set up trade routes and recruit competent guards to escort you and your caravans, offering protection from raiders and brigands on your journey.<br/><br/>Engage in fun minigames to earn high score results, which you can use in-game to improve mass production actions to maximize the quality of your crafted items results and the speed in which you complete them. If you suck at these minigames (or if they\u2019re just not quite your thing), never fear, you can get your friends involved by simply generating a code on your account to share - you will be able to use these results in your crafting!<br/><br/><strong>Carve out your legacy; be a part of the history of Life is Feudal: MMO.</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-19T12:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/03b/03b98789e89e9f8fde939a09f1f7b0c7.jpg", "website": "https://lifeisfeudal.com/", "rating": 2.39, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 25, "owned": 554, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 30, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 379, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bitbox"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Bitbox"], "esrb_rating": null}
