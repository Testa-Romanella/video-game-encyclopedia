Command nimble squadrons of fighters, specialized frigates, and giant capital ships as you orchestrate your forces toward victory. <br/><br/>The new Deluxe Edition includes new missions and ships, for a total of 15 unique ship types. Play through 36 Campaign missions, create your own in Skirmish mode, or play a Multiplayer match against your friends or a stranger.
