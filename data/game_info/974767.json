In subsequent reviews, the games are called the French \u201canswer\u201d to the popular Russian-language series \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Jack,\u201d while specifically emphasizing that the game was voiced by \u201cChristian and Odette themselves\u201d (probably for its \u201creal\u201d version). Let\u2019s admit right away that, despite the \u201cperky\u201d, there is not much \u201csharp\u201d humor here, but the game itself is made much more original than \u201cJack\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T19:00:50", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
