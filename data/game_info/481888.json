In this survivor horror you\u2019ll search through a database full of reports to determine what kind of person lurks behind each one. Everything from cell phone images, decades-old police reports, recent purchases, text conversations, social media accounts, and search history is only a click away to help you assess these reports and either mark them as threats or not. You accomplish these tasks while using the simulated computer system in the game, the A.D.O.S system with tools dedicated to help you. One of these tools being the RootKit which is a virtual cell phone cracking tool. Crack into the suspicious person by sliding around a slider to get the right code! Easy to understand but challenging to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Like most of the population, you work during the day, but at night, your time is your own. It\u2019s not as simple as staying awake through the night to file each report properly. There are killers on the loose, and the work you do has repercussions. In addition to the reports you must submit each night, you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on your surroundings. Staying hyper-vigilant will get you far against these two malicious threats, eager to infiltrate your home. The last thing you want is to run the risk of getting caught off guard. You will accomplish this by walking around the immersive environment of Luna&#39;s home and making sure that windows are closed and the lights are on.</p>\n<p>Collect evidence, correctly file your reports, and survive this horror experience the next simulated 10 nights. If you can keep yourself from getting kidnapped, killed, or worse, you might finally be able to relax. You just need to not die before reaching those sandy beaches you\u2019ve been dreaming about, confident in a job well done.</p>\n<p>Not a fan of jump scares?<br />\nThis game does have jump scares, BUT it is one of the only few games that allow you to turn them off!
