Players lead a civilization, same as AoE, but now players can train and maintain mythological creatures like Hydras, build fantasy buildings like the Gaia Forest and wield powerful spells and curses obtained from worshipping gods. The game features a single player campaign and multiplayer modes through LAN.</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "2002-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T07:12:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/584/584f4c934f490c17462cbd43477fa965.jpg", "website": "http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/", "rating": 4.28, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 42, "beaten": 149, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 39, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 145, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 145, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ensemble Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
