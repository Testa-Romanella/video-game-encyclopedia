A beautiful world in the dark vastness of space. That is\u2026 until one day it was not. Due to some force outside of the normal boundaries of the world. Ochrodian was split into two parallel worlds. One world of light, the\u00a0 Acrhomic world, and one world of dark, the Obsidian world. This split drained the Ocrhodian of all its color and gave rise to monsters of light and dark. To combat this, I gave birth to a new form of life that can traverse the parallel worlds at will and defeat the creatures within them. This new life I named Duo who shall be the key to returning Ochrodian to its once beautiful true form.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>- Mother Ochrodian -</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:30:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae67a68ec7429823edf1937358f68b85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Coding in Fleur"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
