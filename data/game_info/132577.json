It's been a few years since I've done any substantial coding and I've never worked with audio, UI, particles\u00a0or animations in Unity so this was a solid bite for me to chew on.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful chance to learn the pros and cons of working more in Unity and shaking the rust off after so long not programming much at all. My primary focus with this project was to get as much audio-visual feedback in as\u00a0I\u00a0could with such a short period of time, taking inspiration from the overall \"feel\" of Brutal Doom.<br/><br/>Made for the WikiHow Dream Jam, inspired by this tweet. Originally intended to have animated hands operating a joystick to match this, but prioritized mechanics and didn't get around to the hands.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e58e2a398bffbeea1aa28ddf93d5160e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skogi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
