At the moment there are no sound effects as I wasn't able to get around to them. If people like the game I may continue it in the future but otherwise, I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nMovement:\r\nSpace - Jump\r\nWASD - Move\r\nGrapple:\r\nLeftMouse - (hold)Fires grapple (release) returns grapple\r\nLShift - Reel in\r\nLControl - Reel out\r\nAir Movement:\r\nPressing nothing - Continues the momentum of a swing\r\nWASD - Removes all momentum but allows for a small amount of movement for fine-tuning landings\u00a0\r\nLControl - Remove all Up and down (Y-axis) momentum\r\nMisc:\r\nP/ESC - Pause\r\nR - Quick restart\r\n\r\nDevlog:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T00:52:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f6819e480b0b875886fa5f769d5ed8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NullSomnus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
