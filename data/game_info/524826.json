If you clear 3 Damage tiles, you deal 6 damage to your opponent)</p>\n<p>When Special is active, it will be: 4 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Freeze Tile<br/></p>\n<p>Freeze tiles creates unplayable tiles on the opponent's board, effectively \"freezing\" them. Tiles remain frozen for 3 seconds, after which, they will be playable once more.</p>\n<p>The number of \"frozen\" tiles are calculated as: 1 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you clear 3 Freeze tiles, you will freeze 3 of your opponents tiles)</p>\n<p>When Special is active, it will be: 2 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p> Heal Tile<br/></p>\n<p>Heal tiles heal yourself, replenishing your Health.</p>\n<p>The amount you heal is calculated as: 1 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you clear 3 Heal tiles, you will heal for 3 Health)</p>\n<p>When Special is active, it will be: 2 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Special Meter Tile<br/></p>\n<p>Special\u00a0Meter tiles fill up the Special Meter.</p>\n<p>The amount you fill up the special Meter is: 1 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you clear 3 Special Meter Tiles, you fill up the Special Meter by 3)</p>\n<p>The Special Meter also fills up when you take damage, it is calculated by : Damage Taken / 2</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you take 6 damage, you fill up the Special Meter by 3)</p>\n<p>The Special Meter maxes out at 50. When it maxes out, you can press [S] to activate the Special. It will start draining your Special Meter when it is active.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the Special is active, you cannot replenish the Special\u00a0Meter.</p>\r\n Shield Tile<br/>\n<p>Shield tiles fill up your Shields. Shields decay by 1 every second.</p>\n<p>The amount you fill up the Shields is: 1 x Number of cleared tiles.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you clear 3 Shield tiles, you fill up the Shields by 3)</p>\n<p>Shields block half of the incoming damage and\u00a0gets reduced by the amount blocked as well.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you have 6 Shields, and your opponent deals 6 damage, you will take 3 damage instead but\u00a0you will have 3 Shields left)</p>\n<p>Blocking damage with shields do not affect filling up your Special.</p>\n<p>(Eg. If you have 6 Shields, and your opponent deals 6 damage, you will still fill up the Special Meter by 3, even though you take only 3 damage)</p>\n<p>Take note that shields decay by 1 every second. It is effective when blocking short bursts of damage such as when your opponent has their Special active, but not that effective at accumulating Health like Heal tiles do.</p>\n<p><strong>End of Match stats:</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the match, the number of tiles of each type you cleared are displayed.</p>\n<p>The white numbers are total number of tiles, and the numbers in yellow are tiles you cleared when your Special is active.</p>\n\n<p>And thus concludes my tutorial. Hope it helps! And more importantly, helps you have fun with the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future plans for this project:</strong></p>\n<p>I do intend to continue working on the game, even if nobody shows interest in it.
