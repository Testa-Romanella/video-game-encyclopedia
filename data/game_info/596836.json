You play as a mining Submarine, searching for the long lost treasure that had sunk to the bottom of the trench.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your Submarine can only withstand certain pressure before you will crumple, so upgrading your equipment is a must. Since the Submarine isn\u2019t designed for long expeditions, the oxygen levels will deplete rather quickly, so it is useful to upgrade this as well.\r\n</p>\n<p>To collect money to upgrade your equipment you must harvest and sell ores and resources. Search and discover the ores using your light, as when an ore enters your light\u2019s radius, it will become visible to what ore it is. When hovering over the ore, left clicking will harvest it. You can then sell your resources while in your inventory, and once surfaced, you can purchase the necessary upgrades needed.\r\n</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: WASD to Move. E to Open Inventory. Left Click to Harvest Ores.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a332859bde4267152cee7cabcc20fe97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JGUR"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
