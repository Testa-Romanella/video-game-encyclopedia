The moon was bright and brilliant and it began to become so bright that it cracked, and it's light vanished, only to come back moments later\u00a0Gorgeous as ever.</p>\n<p><strong>On</strong> that night the moon affected several people in an unexplained way.<br/>Their eyes became a bright hue of white and very deadly.<br/>When looking into the eyes of these individuals,\u00a0people would die only a little while after complaining of extreme fatigue and exhaustion. However, there existed people who could withstand it; but they were very few.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultimately </strong>though\u00a0it resulted in the vast majority of people\u00a0killing and hunting the individuals who were affected that night, even if a child was born with white eyes it was killed just a little after birth\u00a0by the doctor delivering it. often times without the mother's consent.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>After </strong>word got out about this, millions of women started to give birth in\u00a0secret\u00a0frightened\u00a0that their children too\u00a0might come out with this white-eyed\u00a0defect and be\u00a0taken away from them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>People </strong>with this white-eyed defect were later called\u00a0SilverMoon\u00a0on account of they're bright shining eyes. and sadly although they weren't evil, the government made the hunting and killing of them legal.</p>\n<p><strong>In </strong>this game, you're going to experience one household's perspective on a night much like the first one\u00a0years\u00a0before it.\u00a0\u00a0depending on how you play this game you'll see different outcomes, good and bad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T05:21:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9a/f9ad72b642f304f59be6ab31bddb7b20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["BornstarWish"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
