So I decided that the main factory would just constantly auto produce these saucers that would then just sort of go hunt and kill down the enemy waves as they came.</p>\n<p>I did have the idea of like points around the main base that you would go defend as well but that idea was nixed almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Honestly this game is not done, at all. The enemy waves are me punching in some random numbers. Visual flair and SFX did not get to at all. But you can technically hit a start game button and reach a win or a lose state so good enough!</p><p>Controls</p><p>WASD - Camera movement<br/></p><p>QE or Mouse Wheel -\u00a0Camera Zoom</p><p>Bug: The intro screen is hilariously too big for the embed, but clicking on the button starts the game correctly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T16:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edbbeb09690c567d3b00ca64b7c9c7e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lim_ak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
