You can tell I really phoned it in, but what can you expect when my team fell apart and I still tried to have something for the jam? I literally \"completed\" this an hour before the jam ended!</p>\n<p>Anyway, I didn't make this dreck because I was being lazy, but more because I was trying to learn about Godot, which is the whole point of these jams, after all. The movement kinda sucks, as does the dashing, even if I spent hours drawing sprites for the PC that was originally one of the enemies for the supposed jam game I was making. And then... stuff happened. But hey, better than nothing it is.</p>\n<p>I did this with Godot 3, the 3.0.6 repository to be exact. Not that there's as much difference between the smaller updates than 3.1 is shaping up to be compared to 3.0, which was already a huge update over the Godot 2 repos.</p>\n<p>Serge out, and I wish you all a very nice day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T05:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f35/f3592fff609ae1950f325cd71e21110f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Regression"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
