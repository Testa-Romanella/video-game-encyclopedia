I was given the creative freedom to create something to bring awareness to the world about saving tigers. The answer I had was a video game for it.<br/></p>\n<p>Save Tigers With Suhail is a combination of four different game styles.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game Style 1: </strong>A 2D based adventure game where the hero, Suhail saves Tigers by freeing them from cages. All this has to be accomplished without losing lives.</li><li><strong>Game Style 2: </strong>A Brick Breaker Game to get the player pumped up in saving the ball and breaking each brick smoothly to gain points.</li><li><strong>Game Style 3: </strong>A Quiz Game that brushes on the knowledge about the Tigers and how special they are as a species.</li><li><strong>Game Style 4:</strong> A 2D Maze Game where the tiger has to escape without getting trapped in nets.</li></ul>\n<p><em>( All the audio tracks used in this game does not belong to me. I used them because I like them. I make no profit out of this. It is just an experimental project done in school days.\u00a0)</em><br/></p>\n<p>Save Tigers With Suhail was an exciting project for me as this was the project that was established first under Star Studios.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and do try this game out. Do share your experience with others. And most importantly, Save Tigers :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:36:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35f266ae69ce7f777307dd7d3b475106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Star Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
