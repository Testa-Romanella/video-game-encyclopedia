The spirits play tricks, the dead can be seen, and monsters can run their human world errands.<br/><br/>Set in the 90s, play as Ichabod, a pumpkin man who uses his chance to enter the human world to try and rent Jurassic Park from the video store.\u00a0Unfortunately, the only copy has been rented by a teen who's brought a witch's curse upon the town.<br/><br/>Gameplay is inspired by the classics and the modern classics- a Zeldalike sense of exploration, with the tight, fast combat of Hyper Light Drifter. All soaked in a charming pixel art atmosphere and a dumb sense of humor. Playtime is around 1-2 hours.</p><p>This game is built in the open-source Solarus engine!
