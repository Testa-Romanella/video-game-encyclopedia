It is a sedate and eerie experience, with an ambiguous narrative designed to enhance the mood of dusky ramblings in mysterious places where urban and rural environments overlap.</p>\n<p>An evocative electronic soundscape responds and adapts to your actions as you interact with the environment and it's inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The Edgelands is a proud recipient of funding from Fundbetter, the initiative set up by Failbetter Games, developers of Sunless Sea and Fallen London.</p>\n<p>\"Striking visuals and a killer soundtrack \" - PC Gamer</p>\n<p>\"Superbly Evocative\" - Rock Paper Shotgun</p>\n<p>\"A powerful, personal experience, well worth spending a hazy evening with\" - IndieGames.com</p><p>\u201cOne of the most creatively surreal and bizarrely enthralling indie games of the last several years\u201d \u2013 Starburst Magazine<br/></p>\n<p>\"The Edgelands knows the power of sound design\" - Kill Screen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/405/4059efc81bed3fa8178cca35039654cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marshlight Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
