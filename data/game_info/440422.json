{"id": 440422, "slug": "illuminate-remilistrasza", "name": "Illuminate (Remilistrasza)", "name_original": "Illuminate (Remilistrasza)", "description": "<p>In Illuminate, the gameplay is focused mainly on the sounds and sights around the player. It is played in the first person perspective, with the player using the <em>WASD keys</em> or the <em>arrow keys</em> to maneuver through the dark, colorless town and use the <em>mouse</em> to look around and listen for sounds to help them progress onwards.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The player will be able to interact with objects in the world by <em>left-clicking</em> on the object. Objects such as switches and flashlights that can be interacted with. Any sort of interaction with objects or any player movement will create sound ripples that will light up the area around the player with color and help the player move around a gray, desolate-looking city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The player will be able to pick up objects such as a flashlight and small boxes and rocks, but is limited to picking up only one at a time. Using <em>left-click</em>, the player will pick up an object, and pressing <em>right-click</em> will have the player throw/drop the object. If the player picks up the flashlight, they can turn it on and off using <em>right-click</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a downside to the flashlight in the case that if it is shined on enemies, they will start to aggro on the player. Using the <em>left shift key</em>, the player will be able to run and get away from the enemies that aggro onto them.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Movement</li><li>Left Click: Interact, pick up boxes</li><li>F: Turn on/off flash light</li><li>Left-Shift: Run</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>E: Pick up batteries</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>How Was This Project Planned?</p>\n<p>Our project had a lot of planning. We first thought of what would be\u00a0 the best theme for our game. Ideas like a shooting game, adventure game, puzzle game, scary game, sports, or survival game were on the table.</p>\n<p>We really liked the idea of creating a puzzle game, however figuring out all 5 puzzle to our design was challenging. What we ended up doing is each group member had to come up with 2 different puzzle ideas, and the\u00a0 top five would be designed.</p>\n<p>After deciding the top 5 puzzles, each of us was tasked with designing and building their own puzzle. We created sketches, prototypes, and found different assets that could best fit our map and puzzles. It tooks us about 2 weeks of planning and having a set idea what we were going to do.</p>\n\n<p>Why This Path Of Design?</p>\n<p>Our game is based in a city having a power outage, and it\u2019s up for the player to find all 5 switches to turn on the lights back on. The player will go through obstacles and solve puzzles for each light switch.</p>\n<p>We choose this game design because we like the idea of working with puzzle games. This was a challenge. However, we worked hard and were able to get it done.</p>\n<p>We wanted the player to experience a dark game ,with no sunlight, and have them use their thinking to pass the game. We wanted the game to be challenging and rewarding after being able to complete a puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our game forces the player to think by using their memories, problem-solving skills, spatial memory, and their general knowledge. Instead of creating a shooting game or adventure game, we wanted a game that can help the player sharpen their intellect.</p>\n\n<p>Performance Against Online Schedule</p>\n<p>Moving from in-person to online made our group\u00a0 behind for the first couple of weeks, due to the lack of effort in the game. It was hard to adjust to the new environment and be able to get things done.</p>\n<p>With regular group meetings, class meetings, check lists of materials to work on, and knowing what days we need to get things done, we were able to manage our time effectively and get our game finished.</p>\n\n<p>What was Successful?\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Working player</li><li>Flashlight\u00a0</li><li>Switches</li><li>Art</li><li>Lights pole</li><li>All 5 puzzles completed</li><li>Enemy AI</li><li>Portals</li><li>Enemy Respawning to original position</li><li>Moving platforms</li><li>Finished game on time</li></ul>\n\n<p>What wasn\u2019t Successful?\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Sound on spider when attacking</li><li>Sound when picking up batteries</li><li>Sound when picking up boxes</li><li>Portal designs</li><li>More art in the map/maybe having citizens roaming around/cars/trash cans/ects.</li><li>Making player flashflight have clicking sound when turning off and on</li><li>Have light turn on inside the building windows</li><li>Pathing on the spider puzzle</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Were Goals and Objectives Meet?</p>\n<p>On exception of the first week of working, we were able to meet our goals and objectives that we set for each week.</p>\n<p>We met our goals by understanding what we have to do and what days it had to be completed\u00a0 in order to stay on track.</p>\n\n<p>Future Improvements</p>\n<p>If we were to continue our game design we would focus on making the art visual aesthetic and create a\u00a0 longer story line.</p>\n<p>If we were to redesign our game, we would have about 10 levels with different maps. We would also add dialogue, were the player can talk to people for clues and have enemies on the map.</p>\n<p>Another design we would want for future improvement is to change from first person to third person.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:46:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c1/7c10182269fb30e8558c96b1eae2534a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Remilistrasza"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
