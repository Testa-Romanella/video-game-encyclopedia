Players are divided into two teams, and compete for maritime and mercantile supremacy. Your goal: to plunder more treasures than the other team! To do so, attack towns, destroy them, collect their loot and bring it back to your base, but don't forget; the enemy team has the same cannons you have, and they're not above turning them on you to steal <em>your</em> gold! Of course, you could play the dirty card first and sink them before they even have a chance to take gold back to their base\u2026 or wait for them to build up a sizeable treasury and ransack it all, taking it for the glory of your own team! </p><p>But beware; try and sneak too far from the archipelago, and you might attract some unwanted attention from the Kraken...<br/></p><p><em><strong>Credits</strong></em></p><p><em>Izaak Jobling - Designer, Modeller</em></p><p><em>Etienne Gonthier - Designer, Production</em></p><p><em>Jake Aquilina - Programmer</em></p><p><em>Melody Richards - Programmer</em></p><p><em>Shane Rands - Audio engineer</em></p>Tide &amp; Glory is a student project.
