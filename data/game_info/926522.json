The player is a pink ball, which the user controls with the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. I created 3 levels, each increasing a little bit in difficulty. The main objective is to pass each level by collecting all the jewels and\u00a0getting to the green gate (which takes you to the next level). The player wins after completing level 3. For aesthetics, I based it on Run and used neon colors with a starry night sky as\u00a0the background.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T14:17:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f2027a5a22c6773f73269fbb6b979bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["nishma"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
