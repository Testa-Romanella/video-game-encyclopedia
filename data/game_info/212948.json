This deliberately forces the player to move one hand either off the movement controls or mouse to reload the gun while making them vulnerable to being killed by the monster.</p>\n<p>I will be continuing on with the project as right now this is just a demo showing the rifle and AI system. I will like to create more levels, more gun types that can be reloaded using the arrow keys and more monster types.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more details about this project's development\u00a0please check out my blog:\u00a0https://amulliganblog.wordpress.com/category/ilp/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/636/636c84dbb5962eefcdee65a5abefb353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mr_mulligan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
