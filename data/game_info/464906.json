The theme was 'out of control'.</p>\n<p>You know, life is not easy. You have things to do. And things you want to do. And more. And not everything you do is something you want. But then, you try to do them all. Every single little thing you want adn have to. And you know you can't, and that you shouldn't, but you don't care. You want it all.</p>\n<p>That's what this is about.</p>\n<p>In more straightforward terms, your to do list appears on screen and you have to click it. Knowing you have to do things makes you anxious, and being anxious makes you unhappy, but finishing rewarding tasks makes you happy. Remember that not everything you do is good.</p>\n<p>Participants:</p>\n<p>- gordoforro\u00a0(Coding / Visual Effects): find me on\u00a0github, and\u00a0twitter!<br/>- GGGelo (Coding / Sounds):\u00a0github<br/>- narmuzz (Testing / Images / Brainstorming):\u00a0\u00a0github<br/>- Cristina K (Testing):\u00a0github<br/>- Mateo Barbich (Testing)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:52:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d92f35a9d2ce6789eb05b1b592dea696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GGGelo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
