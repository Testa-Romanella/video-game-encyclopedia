Well, you sure don't hear that every day. What happens happens and unlucky for them, the usual buddies were thrown in the mix. They will need you to help them beat 64 familiar challenges in order to get back home. Good luck!</em></p>\n<p><strong>This is an arcade style game where you dodge enemies and obstacles and try to get to the goal.</strong> Final Challenges is a compilation of the best levels in the Brutal series (Brutal's Challenge DeluXe, Brutal - Halloween Challenges and Brutal - The New Challenges). This game is simple at first glance but with mechanics like quickdashing, parrying, level jumping, and diagonal movement, you'll have fun trying to beat the levels as fast as you can. However, patience is still key for first-timers and experts alike.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8464a8243c74ea435dae49acd4e163.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brutalmoon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
