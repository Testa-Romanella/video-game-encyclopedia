If you do a good enough job, you will progress to more difficult levels, and if you do a really good job, you will get the tools to whack like you've never whacked before.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMods: This game allows the user to replace the moles with whatever model they would like. Simply add a folder called 'MoleModels' into the 'Resources' folder, and add .obj and .mtl files! Try putting a model of your boss! Or anyone else you think deserves a good whacking!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/313/31384f1eca23bf7fccee1a8f7ba9261d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ross Grambo", "Scott Grambo"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grambo Games L.L.P"], "esrb_rating": null}
