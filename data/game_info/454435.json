The less health you have, the smaller you are and the more damage you do. Left click is a shot, and right click is a shield that drains your health and reflects bullets back at enemies. You can stand on puddles to regain health.\u00a0The game is meant to be beaten as fast as possible, so its important to balance risk (being at low health) and reward (beating the game faster). :)</p>\n<p>MADE BY THE BIDEO GAEM TEAM</p>\n<p>PrinceofJ, SilentHubba, Swimdoctor, Tsunaminal</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T09:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/acea5fe777bc16b3842fa07cf9e610e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["swimdoctor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
