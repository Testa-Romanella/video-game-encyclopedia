You can't read yet, have no idea how anything works or that there is a goal to the game, but you are fascinated. This becomes a formative memory to your older self.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NostalgiaOD </strong>is a game about childhood video game nostalgia made to look and feel like the <em>memory</em> of playing a game from the N64/PS1 era as a child for the first time.<br/>Everything is written in a fantasy font and the controls are unlike what you would expect, bringing back a learning curve for even the most basic things. <br/></p>\n<p>Figure out how to move, interact and explore and find your own kind of play. </p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong><br/>The game was made over the course of a month by Julian Spath and Samuel Korn for an university paper called \"Designing for Nostalgia\". Originally, it was presented in an exhibition, consisting of the game on CD including box and booklet (which was the paper itself), playable on a CRT Monitor with a keyboard re-labelled in the games' fantasy font, at a desk filled with  nostalgia-inducing memorabilia.<br/>More pictures of the exhibition: <br/>http://www.julianspath.com/projects/nostalgiaod/nostalgiaod.html<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Before you play</strong><br/>Recommended resolution: 640x480 Fullscreen <br/>You can use the PDF manual to look at the controls, or try out on your own. <br/>When in fullscreen, exit the game with ALT+F4.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d5447c0a1b675feaf579fff8df1f696.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hussjules"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
