He is retired now and mostly sold up but he still owns a cafe and a hostel, so you get free food and a free bed, everything else you have to hustle for. The idea is based on the idea of walking around town and seeing hot girls that you would like to get to know, this game tries to bring that to life.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd75082e5e7b2fe14b93792ae3b69715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mickydoo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
