Sadly i couldn't use all the time that i had available, i didn't develop the mechanics that good and neither had time to make music for it, but I could finish the game and deliver a decent experience at least :D I hope you have fun playing it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0ef2a41a9c0e65ed5e5e39d289835a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waive"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
