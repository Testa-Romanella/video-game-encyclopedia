It will soon be a year since I got back to using Godot, and so I have convinced myself to finally share it publicly, please enjoy.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13feea5ea1732b22bded0c06c3cd6602.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Van"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
