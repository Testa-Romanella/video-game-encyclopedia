The irony of putting these two different aspects is what honestly drives the story, which is about a lost individual faced with an impossible situation and lurking demise. A short, interactive and choice-based horror story, 1-800 puts the reader in the position of the character, the intent being to have the reader feel the same unease and discomfort as the character should be feeling.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:48:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d20e2a9899196ebc28c160787279628a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flygontime"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
