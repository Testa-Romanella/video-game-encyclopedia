An internal dual can be just as powerful as a physical one, and in my game, you are struggling to regain consciousness after being knocked out in step one made by\u00a0Xanderwood which you should totally check out!</p><p>I also found an amazing jam\u00a0LSDJAM 2020 - itch.io\u00a0which I had no clue about, but after reading about it, my dreamscape level fits perfectly so I decided to submit it there too!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>- Use WASD to move<br/>- Click Around to examine your environment, finding clues to solve the final riddle!</p>\n<p>Huge thank you to all the devs, I have had an absolute blast and am really proud of what we have all achieved! Extra praise\u00a0to Xanderwood for organizing this amazing event, he is an awesome guy please go and check him out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy Gaming Everyone, Hope you like it :D</p>\n<p>Assets Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Low Poly Dungeons Lite | 3D Dungeons | Unity Asset Store</li><li>Low Poly Medieval &amp; Sci-fi Door - Download Free 3D model by NatashaMay (@NatashaMay) [9a25844] - Sketchfab</li></ul>\n<p>Music Used under the Creative Commons \u2014 Sampling Plus 1.0:</p>\n<ul><li>Background Music:\u00a0Freesound - \"www.soundbyter.com-peaceful-bells.wav\" by soundbyter.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72e/72e461d416147d4f21ea97bcad5b8d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BLANKdev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
