A spin-off of the Final Fantasy series, the game spawned a metaseries of the same name. It was released in Japan on August 8, 2003; in North America on February 9, 2004, and in Europe and Australia on March 12, 2004.<br />\nMany new gameplay elements were included in this game, such as real-time fighting and GameCube-Game Boy Advance compatibility; it was the first role-playing video game to incorporate the latter. Its music was composed by Kumi Tanioka. It received positive reviews, many of which described the graphics as beautiful and the multiplayer design as innovative. Five further Crystal Chronicles games have been released (chronologically, two sequels, one distant prequel, and two more); one for the Wii has been released, as well as two for the WiiWare download service; My Life as a King and My Life as a Darklord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-13T06:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fff/fff30d07987aa2fb9583517c4f120bd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 11, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 20, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 28, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 29, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["The Game Designers Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
