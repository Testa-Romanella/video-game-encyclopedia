Here is a list of known issues:</p><ul><li>The undo/redo buttons don't work with the move tool.</li><li>The load/undo/redo buttons will reset the ship rotation\u00a0to 0 which can be confusing when there are a lot of moving parts.</li><li>The editor won't prevent you from having\u00a0zero or more than one spawn points.</li><li>In rare cases moving and cutting an arc will result in it collapsing and making the entire circle buggy.</li></ul><p>Basic usage</p><ul><li>Press O to open the level editor at any point during the game.</li><li>Pan around using the movement keys or middle mouse button.\r\n</li><li>Change the ship rotation using the slider in the top left corner.</li><li>The camera buttons to the right of the screen can be clicked multiple times to cycle between different parts of the level.</li><li>The custom level is saved to your browser's localStorage and won't overwrite the original one. Use the load button to continue editing your custom level if you reload the game.</li></ul><p>In order to make changes to the level, select a layer using the buttons to the left of the screen. The game uses\u00a05 layers:</p>EntityAnything that is not part of the ship or terrain: spawn point, text, collectibles, blocks and orbsShipThe rotating walls of the shipShip BGThe rotating background of the ship, use this layer to add new rings and change their speed/width using the properties panelGroundThe moon surface tilemapGround BGThe moon surface background tilemap<p>The main character is not part of any layer and can be dragged around the level at any time.</p><p>To add or remove an object from the current layer, use the object picker in the bottom left corner. It works similarly to many digital painting tools where you left click to select a primary object (outlined in white)\u00a0and right click to select a secondary one(outlined in black). The first object is an empty one used to delete already placed objects.</p><p>Let me know if you encounter an issue a bug I haven't listed above.</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T11:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df40a185268fea82111e367bd61262be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jebouin"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
