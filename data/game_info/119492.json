I made it to teach myself a bunch of C# tricks, and it's sort of a 'practice\" game where I coded an adventure game framework from scratch. As such... it ain't much to look at. But, I love a good scrappy piece of um, \"work,\" so I hope you enjoy it! </p><p>Features:</p><p>-- A lot of dads telling terrible jokes!</p><p>-- \"Art\" and \"animation!\"</p><p>-- 6 scenes of puzzles that you pretty much can't not solve</p><p>-- two minutes of \"gameplay!\"</p><p>-- a really cute cat named Mimsy!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>-- Left and right arrow keys to walk, mouse to interact with buttons onscreen</p><p>This game is dedicated to my dad, the man who is responsible for my sense of humor today.
