Developing a game for a game jam was really fun, because we had a lot of ideas that we wanted to implement.<br/>We could'nt implemented everything and still the game turned out as 'Feature Creep'. But still this was a lot of fun, we highly appreciate any comments and feedback :D</p>\n<p><strong>Disclamer: The game can be a little buggy and isn't fully finished. <br/>Also you can experience some performance issues as a result of missing optimizations (the lights doesn't seem to work in Safari).</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a607dcf4334818227df911a07a4c1c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jan Schneider"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
