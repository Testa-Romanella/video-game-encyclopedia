With some game mechanics and \r\nsome interesting effects Neon Festival tries to give you a \r\nchallenging experience if you're not smart. Hit your saber \r\ncorrectly or miss!   \r\n  \r\nThis is my first time actually participating in a gamejam. I \r\nlearned a lot about what I can do, what I can't do, what I \r\ndidn't do and what I could have done. It was one of the best \r\nexperiences I've had, even though I couldn't get the result I\r\nwanted (which was impossible) I still think I got something \r\nreasonable and presentable. \r\nThanks for who played the game!  \r\nAnd for those who want to know the number of team members are: \r\nMe (Programmer and half mouth artist) and a friend of mine who \r\nunderstands music and also gave some good ideas for this game to \r\nbecome what it is.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a29445461a48b7d6c55e81d952dab0eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One to One"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
