You have foreseen the return of <strong>DEVILS</strong> to the lands, and presented your prophecy to the king. Unfortunately, the king has grown foolish and complacent, and ignored your warning. Guess it's your problem now!</p>\n<p>Oracle Chain is a game I made for ChainletterJam, in which I was nominated by the lovely torcado to make a game in 2 weeks based on their entry, ribbit digits. It's a turn-based game where you essentially have to simulate the enemy's actions in your head, and respond appropriately!</p>\n<p>PS... there is an unlockable secret if you can get a score of at least 10 ;)<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p>\n</p><p><strong>#ChainLetterJam Info!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If nominated, you have two weeks to make a 1 minute game in some way inspired by the game that nominated you. Once finished, put #ChainLetterJam in your game description, a link  to the game that nominated you, and then nominate two other devs (if you want to!).  </p>\n<p>Previous games in this chain:  </p>\n<ol><li>Wordman Saves the Day by  miziziziz \r\n</li><li>Word Bounce by vimlark \r\n</li><li>Word Bounce 3D by niborious \r\n</li><li>Arithmetic Bounce by patrickgh3</li><li>Dungeon Bounce by drogen</li><li>Ribbit Digits by torcado</li><li>Oracle Chain, by me! :)</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:08:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/073572a4510c975dd2011ba5a98bc6e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Blabberf"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
