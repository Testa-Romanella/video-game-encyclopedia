It has better graphics and sound than ever before, and includes more levels, more monsters and more puzzles than any other <strong>Black Dawn</strong> game.\u00a0Are you ready for the challenge?</p>\r\nStar date: 2621\r\nThe TFS Sentinel is en route to Base DS97 to investigate a communications blackout.\r\nStar system: Thalax\r\nPlanet: Thalax 9\r\nEnsign Bren is dispatched to investigate the base. Bren takes his scout ship into orbit around the planet, a\u00a0routine mission. Planetfall is uneventful. From the outside, the base seems operational and undamaged, yet, something does not feel right. Bren dons his life support system and depressurises the cockpit.\u00a0The canopy whirrs open, revealing a thin and clear atmosphere. The entrance yields to the ensign\u2019s authorisation code.\u00a0As he descends into the lower levels, a bad feeling creeps upon him.\r\n<p><strong>Design &amp; code:</strong> Shaun Watters\r\n<strong>Graphics:</strong> TenShu\r\n<strong>Music &amp; Sound:</strong> Mike Richmond\r\n<strong>Introduction code:</strong> Colin Vella</p>\n<p><strong><em>Featuring:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>64 colours on screen</li><li>7 dungeons (21 levels) to explore</li><li>14 different weapons</li><li>21 different types of enemies (3 per dungeon)</li><li>Amazing animated introduction using an entire floppy!</li><li>PAL / NTSC compatible</li><li>Hard drive installable</li><li>Requires at least 1.5Mb of ram (of which <strong>1Mb must be chip ram</strong>)</li><li>3D movement effects available for faster Amiga.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:27:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6f/f6f9d5c081c8a42dfff2a8f72999a039.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 305, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["timeslip1974"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
