Arrows move the barcode scanner. X scans a barcode. Z to restart from the game over screen.</p>Objective<p>Scan as many barcodes as you can in the 90 seconds allotted. Be careful not to flip the boxes too fast, or you'll have to go all the way back around.</p>Commentary<p>This game has been on the back burner for ages. The inspiration was trying to simulate a cube/box that you could flip over in a semi-real way, but I spent ages messing with that and ultimately couldn't make it work. It was a classic case of solving a problem the game didn't need to be solved. I changed it so that the box always flipped over to the 'next' side, so you just needed to carefully press one button instead of imagining a real cube. It's not as cool, but it did allow this game to happen.</p><p>Lexaloffle BBS thread: here</p><p>#1GAM April 2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5c0bcb5616193d58146d1d602b165f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
