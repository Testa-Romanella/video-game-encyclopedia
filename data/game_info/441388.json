This is a prototype to test the movement controls and procedural animations for a jumping spider.\u00a0Will probably be updated as I improve things. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything here should be considered a work-in-progress! The model, the \"world\", the animations, all of it! The overall controls and movement are the closest to being \"finished\". <br/></p>\n<p>I'm hoping to make an actual game (with goals and obstacles and everything) starring a similar jumping spider in the future!
