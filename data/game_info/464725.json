While this helps you finishing the levels faster, it becomes harder and harder to move around. You can reset your speed by touching an wall, but be careful to reach the end in time. Don't get <strong>out of control</strong> and move through the levels correctly<strong>!</strong></p>\r\n***\r\n<p>This game is my entry for the <strong>GMTK Game Jam 2020: Out of Control</strong>\u00a0and was made in 48h. All programming and art was made by me. Audio assets from freesound.org and credited in game.\u00a0While short and having some parts with rough coding, pretty satisfied with the result for my first game jam ever.</p>\r\n***\r\nKnown bugs (so far):\r\n<ul><li>If you align the player's square sprite with specific pixels through the levels, the tilemap grid may bug and expose white outlines.</li><li>Your speed will not reset\u00a0 if you move from an wall to another while touching it.</li><li>You can stop the player's movement if you move towards an wall you're already touching it while in movement.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/370f63130f1af1bf027553a6ec3bddbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pedroaurelio_n"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
