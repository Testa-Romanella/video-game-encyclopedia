You can choose the amount of money, oxygen, and air you produce. You can gain research if there are enough people on board. Each person breathes one oxygen per second, and each research pad needs a person to man it. Gain enough research to win. If you run out of oxygen it's game over.</p>\n<p>Changlog</p>\n<p>Any bug reports, feature suggestions, or feedback in general is very much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W/Up Arrow: Move screen up</p>\n<p>D/Down Arrow: Move screen down</p>\n<p>A/Left Arrow: Move screen left</p>\n<p>D/Right Arrow: Move screen right</p>\n<p>Esc: Pause menu/leave current menu</p>\n<p>R: Rotate Research Tile</p>\n<p>Left Click: Opens menus/Selects Tiles/Places Tiles</p>\n<p>Right Click: Deselect Tile</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb7d3353a75721a2afcf29cd2a2e616e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ShadowlightGaming"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
