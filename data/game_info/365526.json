There is nothing wrong with being active to do the house chores, but the problem is, she could never do things right and would mess up everything she touches. It boils your anger even more one day when you realized that she accidentally destroyed your favourite dress while washing it. You had enough of her and decided to get rid of her once and for all\u2026<br/></p>\n<p>\u25cf There are 4 dirty spots that Putih would need to clean up in every level<br/>\u25cf Putih will randomly choose a dirty spot every round to clean up, players will then need to<br/>predict which route that she will take and set up deadly traps along the way<br/>\u25cf Players will be able to kill her by utilizing the various objects placed around the level.<br/>\u25cf Different objects will create a different outcome when used differently with different objects.<br/>\u25cf But not all objects are deadly towards Putih only, it could be deadly towards the player too!<br/>\u25cf Putih will go back and have a rest after cleaning one dirty spot, giving players a short amount of time to prepare for the next attempt.<br/>\u25cf If players do not manage to kill Putih before she cleans the last dirty spot and leaves<br/>the level, the player fails and would need to retry again.<br/><br/>RareBird Games is a\u00a0team that consists of a balance number of programmers, designers and artists.
