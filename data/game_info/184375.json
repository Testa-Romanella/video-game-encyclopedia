It shows the impracticality and ridiculousness of revealing and sexualised armour in RPG games by using a male character.<br/></p>\n<p>The intention of the armour is to promote sex sells and highlight beauty standards of women in video games. The message we want the audience to take from this game is that too often women are objectified and given skimpy outfits, while men are usually fully covered/protected. We hope to create more awareness of the stereotypes of women and men costumes in games and reveal the true nature of the mainstream gaming culture in today's society. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Press spacebar to play.<br/></p>\n<p>Created by\u00a0Kat Latcham,\u00a0Sophie Gower and Crystal Nugent</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ed/1ed55f65add2f00820724e33d1484927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystal Nugent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
