However, online features are disabled. All scoreboards will be saved locally and you will not see global scoreboards. Your progress is also saved locally.</p>\n<p>When online mode is on, your scores will be saved on the global scoreboards when you press <em>Save Score</em> button after the result is displayed. Your progress in online mode is saved on the server. Your offline progress can not be transferred to the server to prevent cheating, so if you're planning to play online please consider doing so from the beginning to not start over when switching into online mode.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Important</em></strong>: when making online account,\u00a0please write down your password! We do not store passwords and do not have password reset feature yet, so please keep your password safe. Password must\u00a0include a letter, a digit and a special character (like \"!\" or similar), and must be 8 characters long. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>\n<p><strong>Duel system description</strong>:</p>\n<p>To be able to challenge your friend to a duel you must enable online mode. When challenging a friend an automatic email will be sent to them with a duel code and a\u00a0link to download the game. Your friend then will have to install the game, enable online mode, and go to <em>Duel Challenges Menu</em> from <em>Main Menu</em> screen to <em>Accept Duel</em>. They will then complete the challenge and the score will be updated. You can view your duels in <em>My Duels</em> list in the <em>Duel Challenges Menu</em>. If the duel has a \"?\" mark in the score - it hasn't been accepted yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Please, let us know about bugs, missing features or your suggestions in the comments!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:40:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaef62fbf8c9f78c8706b66495528fb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DmitryDaDev"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
