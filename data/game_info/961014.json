{"id": 961014, "slug": "last-holiday", "name": "Last Holiday", "name_original": "Last Holiday", "description": "Last Holiday takes place in a picturesque North Bohemian village during the holidays in the year 2000, where a good little boy seeks refuge from an angry father who can't stand the fact that he didn't pass his high school exams. You have to take care of all your needs, like food, drink, cigarettes, beer, girls and just everything that goes with village life. Can you do that with the constant bullying from your rival Bruno?<br/><br/><br/><br/>There's not much to do in the village. So what about your free time? Just picking up girls, throwing lake parties, the occasional village disco. You'll find some of that \"gamble\" in the pub. So no city sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll. But proper redneck: Chicks, beer, fast Cars and a bit of business with your mate Slavek.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the protagonist, who, like any youth his age, knows everything and is the smartest person in the world (like the reddit community). Gradually, Ben and his friend Slavek will find ways to make their way in the harsh countryside, earning slag and securing the respect of more than just the sluts! During the holidays, Ben will also meet all sorts of interesting people from the picturesque village in North Bohemia and will gradually help them with their hardships.<br/><br/>You can't get respect and status as a tough guy with a small car or a bicycle. For that, you need a big-ass car that can charm the city slickers. For that you'll need a ride, but you'll have to not only build it, but also modify it and take care of it. The engine, the aerodynamics, the suspension, or the number of stickers on the spoiler will affect the performance!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Life isn't just about cars. A young Ben-type must be able to provide entertainment outside of his car and secret collection of men's magazines under his bed. While it may seem that a small village doesn't offer many activities, the reality is the opposite! Fancy a bit of gambling? In the pub, the local regulars are greasing their cards and you can swindle them out of their last pennies for a beer. Are you tempted to multiply your paycheck? Slot machine is always there. Fancy a bit of boy-on-girl action? Try picking them all up for a unique prize! But watch out... there may be a so-called Black Peter hiding among them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To keep it simple and not just about the story, the player will have to deal with the harsh realities of life. You can die of pretty much anything in the village, and if you're not careful about your needs, it's easy to die of starvation, dehydration, stress, or unprotected sex. Can you gradually build up your image and not die?<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the ultimate village fighter, to defy your rival and make money to prove to your parents that even without a high school diploma, a man is his own boss?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T05:35:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5c3930862df3266029fa888ec1a240.jpg", "website": "https://lastholiday.game", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boomer Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boomer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
