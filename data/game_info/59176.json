Begin a journey in a virtual world where anything is possible, and nothing is as it appears. On this adventure fight your way through contaminated levels of cyberspace and take on and eliminate the deadliest of enemies. Additionally, it is necessary to successfully unlock codes that will make it possible to gate hack to even more environments. Saved data from Part 1 can be brought over and used to level up characters and items. There is dual voiceover included. So chose either the English or Japanese language. And finally simulate a MMORPG so that no Internet connection is required! This is the only way to discover who or what is behind \u201cThe World\u201d.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2002-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-26T09:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dea/dea3ffd2ee465017a545b240a8fe63bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 4, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["CyberConnect2 Co."], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment", "Bandai"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
