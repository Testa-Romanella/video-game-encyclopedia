First developped with Basic (Purebasic), the next episodes were coded with C# and now Unity. The \"Origins\" episode was even published on Xbox 360.<br/></p>\n<p>Last year i've decided to make a \"final\" episode. It was released on Xbox One and Windows 10 for a time, then i thought that it will be playable for free; it's a game by players for players and i've put all my love of the genre in it (with my small capacities). I hope you will have some fun to play it!</p>\n<p>The game gives you:</p>\n<ul><li>5 levels of pure action and 5 variants of these levels</li><li>4 \"episodes\" level (bonus)</li><li>Some cool shaders effects powered by Unity</li><li>12 mini games to unlock</li><li>60fps even on a modest computer</li><li>Play with keyboard or gamepad</li></ul>\n<strong>Minimum requirements</strong>: Windows 10, CPU Intel/AMD, 2Go RAM, 300Mo free disk space, Direct X11 Graphic Card (Intel IRIS &amp; Integrated compatible)<br/><em>The game is provided as it is for free by the developer, and even though it has been tested on many configurations, it cannot be held responsible for any damage to your software/hardware.
