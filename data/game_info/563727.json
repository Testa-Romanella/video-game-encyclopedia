(Playing yourself on the same PC will just cause errors).\r\nPlz share and help community grow.\r\nSee Leaderboards here:\r\n<p>https://www.entertainment-calculator.com/chess-sphere-leaderboard</p>\r\nRules:\r\n<p>1. Kill the king, there are no checkmates, capture the king to win.<br/>2. The game will not prevent\u00a0 you from moving your king into danger.<br/>3. There are no special moves like En Passant or Castling. Pawns do not start with 2 space moves.<br/>4. Move pawn past the orange line to promote to queen.<br/>5. Queen, Rook and Bishop can only move up to 7 spaces at a time.<br/>6. Pawn can move back and forth in any direction, but only diagonal when capturing an enemy.</p>\n<p>Additional rules for Evolved Mode characters:</p>\n<p>1. \"Delegate\" is the opposite of Pawn, it only moves diagonally, but has to capture vertically/horizontally.</p>\n<p>2. \"Jester\" moves like Knight but 1 spaces further, 3 down/1 to the side.</p>\n<p>3. \"Ninja\" moves like Bishop and can jump over any piece, but can only capture an enemy if not jumping over another piece to get it. Only moves up to 4 spaces at a time.</p>\n<p>4. \"Ghost\" moves like Rook and can jump over any piece, but can only capture an enemy if not jumping over another piece to get it. Only moves up to 4 spaces at a time.</p>\n<p>5. \"Matador\" moves like Queen but only up to 2 spaces at a time, basically he's the King's right hand man.<br/></p>\n<p>6. \"Genie\" has the combined abilities of Ghost and Ninja. Delegates are promoted to Genie after moving past the orange line.</p>\n\n<p>The high score leaderboard is temporary and will eventually be replaced with a proper global ranking system, once i figure out how to do that.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned and follow, a 1 player mode will be available very soon, the AI for it is almost complete.</p>\n<p>Way better graphics coming soon too!</p>\n<p>Chess Sphere official website: https://www.entertainment-calculator.com/chess-sphere</p>\n<p>Follow on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChessSphere/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T05:48:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e354689937d5a358ee815966a240f36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Betamaximus-128"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
