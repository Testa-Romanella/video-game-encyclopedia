Deliver the cargo to the Neubach branch office in 23 days. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe only problems are that the roads are dangerous, your budget is limited, and you don't even know what you're carrying in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFortunately, you're a resourceful young man. Plan, negotiate, and trade your way through the Free Cities, and you might not only finish your task, but even make a little money in the process. Fail to manage your time or budget, however, and you'll find yourself stranded in a foreign city without a penny in your name. Or even find yourself at the wrong end of a brigand's sword.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour companions are the young accountant Emily de Vries, and the veteran mercenary captain \"Lucky\". Heed their advice, and they might get you out of a pickle or two.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd don't miss your deadline.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T03:30:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c4d70e37ca10d80ba42464c222efc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vellescian Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Vellescian Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
