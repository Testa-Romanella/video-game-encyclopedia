This is one of many tasks that slaves had to do to produce sugar, which was a tedious and physically draining process. In this game, we hope to convey this part in a way that emphasizes the cruel nature that slaves went through.</p><p>Credits\u00a0</p>\n<p>David E: Unity Programmer &amp; Implementer</p>\n<p>Glendale B: Writer &amp; Researcher</p>\n<p>Laura B: Pixel Artist &amp; Researcher</p>\n<p>Tony T: Artist &amp; Character Designer</p>\n<p>Bibliography</p>\n<p>https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/893191422608556093/920360702030540920/Bib...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:00:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e344ecb045a42a6d47126f49717bc5a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lb.io", "David Eisenberg", "NetCruiser"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
