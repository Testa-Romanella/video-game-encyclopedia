This is a game demo made in seven weeks in Wolf RPG Editor for Dream Diary Jam 4. The concept and mechanics are based on the 2004 indie game Yume Nikki. </p>\n<p>While I didn't complete all that I planned for the jam, this was my first time making a game project with more content than 1 or 2 rooms (and my first time using Wolf RPG Editor) and I'm glad I was able to accomplish what I did.\u00a0I am looking forward to expanding the game in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>Currently there are 3 worlds and 3 cosmetic effects to obtain. (There is nothing interactable in the restaurant world yet but it is still accessible. You will know it when you see it.)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>\r\nUse arrow keys to move<br/>\r\nZ to confirm or interact<br/>\r\nX to cancel or open the menu<br/>\r\nF4 to change the screen size</p>\n<p>Interact with the bed to dream. Explore dreams and interact with characters or scenery to obtain effects. Select \"Wake Up\" in the menu to wake from the dream.
