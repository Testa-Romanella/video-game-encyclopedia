This is my first ever game jam and my second game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am relatively new to Unity and thought that I might as well join a game jam as it would give me inspiration to constantly work on a game to get better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that I cannot draw or make music so hopefully, the artwork or the lack of music is not the only thing that catches your eyes.\u00a0 With that being said, there is a sound that plays after each level.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Salt Bonds: Stronger Together<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the salt (NaCl) into the water. You start off each level with two characters Sodium (Na) and Chlorine (Cl). If you get both characters together, you can combine and form Salt (NaCl). Each character has its own properties, but clearly Salt is the best. <br/>You control Sodium with the WAD keys and Chlorine with the arrow keys. You control Salt with the WAD keys. The R key is used to switch between states, and the F key is used to interact with buttons. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>There are different power-ups and interactable objects in this game as well. Only salt can collect power-ups and only sodium can interact with buttons. All this (and more information) is in the Codex of the game. <br/></p>\n\n<p>I also added a timer in the game, but the timer only works if you start on level one (in case you wanted to speed run the game). </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I hope you had fun playing this game.</p>\n\n<p>I was having some problems with the resolution. The screen resolution I was working with is different than it is now and I don't really know how to fix it. The best I could do was to resize the game in the publish settings. You can try to download the game, but I don't know if that would be better. <br/></p>\n<p>If you do download the game, the window is resizable. Resize is so that the timer is on the edge of the map (once you play the game). <br/></p>\n\n<p>Sorry about the resolution problem. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf3/cf319b30b4a0b4a68dc40846118933c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Pandas and Broccoli"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
