As their tale unfolds, ever stranger details are revealed when even the\u00a0</em><em>gamemaster doesn\u2019t know who the survivor is!</em></p>\n<p>This is a survival horror one-shot for <strong>Fate</strong> for 3 or 4 players and a GM to experience an ill-fated Spring Break trip on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain. The adventure is told in flashback as investigators go over the sole survivor's account of the trip, with key elements of the story introduced as scene aspects to help guide the players along. That isn't to say the story is charted in advance:\u00a0plenty of leeway has been left to explore the true course of the evening and experience those final hours where the shallows break.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the Ludo song <em>Lake Pontchartrain</em>\u00a0, this adventure also comes with author's notes explaining different paths through the adventure and alternate takes on some of the story beats within, gained from years of convention playthrough. The author's notes are included with any purchase at full price.</p>\n<p>Note:\u00a0This is a scenario written explicitly around PC death. Secret mechanics address how the scenario plays out as the surviving party gets whittled down to a Final PC.</p>\n<p>Photo by\u00a0Eoin Anderson\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:55:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c9/3c9918978bdf8b541fb9f75afbfa587f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerdhausGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
