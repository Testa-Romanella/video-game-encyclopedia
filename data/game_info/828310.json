{"id": 828310, "slug": "knob", "name": "KNOB", "name_original": "KNOB", "description": "<p>controller support only - no keyboard support!<br/></p>\n<p>2 player local pvp - no single player!\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>This is my submission to the <strong>Remake the Classics #1</strong> game jam!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Grab a friend and battle it out! You control two doors slamming a door knob around. Whoever sinks it into the void scores a point. Equip yourselves with powerful abilities and destroy your friends opponents! <br/>But wait, there's more...<br/>To actually gain the just mentioned abilities you play a mini game on the back layer. Whoever wins, will receive three abilities and might take the lead.</p>\r\nRules\r\n<p>- first player reaching 9 points wins the match<br/></p>\n<p>- the player who did not touch the knob last, is always serving next</p>\n<p>- the four buttons on the side show you which abilities are ready to use<br/></p>\n<p>- activate abilities with the corresponding buttons located on your controller<br/></p>\n<p>- abilities can only be activated while the knob is  inside the main field between the two home lines as illustrated below</p>\n\n\n\r\nImportant note\r\n<p>This game is not yet finished and will receive updates. So step by  anytime soon and check out the following features i plan to add like:\r\n    </p>\n<p>- more mini games\r\n    </p>\n<p>- tournament mode for multiple players\r\n    </p>\n<p>- selectable player names <br/><br/></p>\r\nAbilities\r\n<p>Abilities spice up the game of slamming doors pushing a knob around and are mostly gained by winning the back layer mini game which i will explain later. <br/></p>\n<p>You gain abilities on various occasions:</p>\n<p>- after every three points scored by any player, both players receive 1 ability<br/></p>\n<p>- when you win a layer game you gain 3 random but different abilites</p>\n<p>- mini game ties reward both players with 1 ability</p>\n\n<p>The four abilities as currently implemented are:<br/></p>\r\nIllusion (A or south button)\r\n<p>Create two fake balls messing around with your opponents attention. Variants are planned for an update.<br/></p>\r\nOffensive Wall (X or west button)\r\n<p>Summon three walls right outside your opponents base line.\u00a0 These mysterious structures seem to bend the law of physics.<br/>But beware! If the current layer game is TTT your opponent theoretically can mark two times in quick succession - and it's totally legal!<br/></p>\r\nSpeed Attack (Y or north button)\r\n<p>Add a speed boost to the knob! It will return to its original speed when scoring or touching the other player. The knob may exceed its maximum speed whil the boost is active.<br/></p>\r\nStealth Attack (B or east button)\r\n<p>Now you see me, now you don't. I will reveal myself just when it might be too late.<br/><br/></p>\r\nMini Game(s)\u00a0\r\n<p>Given the two weeks limitation of the game jam there is currently only one mini game available. After cleaning up the code base, adding more mini games  is number one on my todo list.<br/></p>\r\nTTT\r\n<p>The player to the left is always X, the player to the right is always O.\r\nWhenever you touch the knob, you draw your mark on your cursors current location.</p>\n<p>Control the cursor with the right stick. Mark three in a row to win TTT and receive three abilities. <br/></p>\n\r\nWhat's left to say?\r\n<p>Font \"8-bit Arcade\" by Damien Gosset taken from here<br/></p>\r\nSpecial thanks to Janinja for playtesting with me!\r\n<p>Please leave some feedback as i want to improve this game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T17:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c52/c5241988c5d3b616786460b104a5f901.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andvaranaut Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
