Also, it was made in only 48 hours!</p>\n\n<p>Made\u00a0for the Mix and Game Jam,\u00a0 we based it on the main mechanic of Rocket League, which is to score a goal using cars, but instead of cars we used skate rollers. But they wasn't fun enough, so we give them guns!</p>\n\n<p>Roller League is a couch multiplayer game, the main objective is to score a goal before your opponent. To accomplish this you can\u00a0 push the ball with your own body, or you can shoot it with your gun! However your bullets are limited, so be careful with them.</p>\n\n<p>The controls are very simple, and because of it we wanted to support as many controllers as we could, this turned out very well actually (at least according to our tests).</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard:<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong> WASD or Arrow Keys</li><li><strong>Shoot:\u00a0</strong>Space</li></ul></li><li>Gamepad:<ul><li><strong>Move: </strong>Left Stick or D-Pad</li><li><strong>Shoot:</strong>\u00a0Any Button</li></ul></li><li>Mouse: <em>(Yes, you can play with only the mouse)</em><ul><li><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0 Right Click</li><li><strong>Shoot:</strong> Left Click</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>We expect you to enjoy it as much as we do!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:01:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed12670e931acccc474adc6e5ce56bcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Watita Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
