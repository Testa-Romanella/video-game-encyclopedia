The protagonist of the game is blamed for killing a princess. To prove his innocence he starts an adventure and investigates the murder. Accompanied by a dwarf and a mage, he slashes the way to the truth through hordes of enemies.</p>\n<p>The game places the focus on fights. The first feature is that every hit has a 95% chance to work; this means that even a close punch can be failed. The second feature is the interactive entertainment: during fights you can set things on fire or destroy buildings to hurt or distract your enemies.</p>\n<p>The game also features a development system. You can upgrade members of your party with experience points you get from battles. Imbalanced resource management can lead to huge problems during the fights.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2014-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-05T14:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d6/5d6ab867b41a604eceee6c4026292e41.jpg", "website": "http://www.blackguards-game.com", "rating": 2.8, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 104, "owned": 1680, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 38, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 85, "suggestions_count": 619, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 85, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Daedalic Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
