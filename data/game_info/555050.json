In this snake-like game you have to be wary of your battery life and make sure to return to it before you run out of power.\u00a0 You can collect more charge along the way which will increase your range step by step. However, be careful not to forget to connect a lightbulb as well, as without it returning to your battery will result in a short circuit. This means you have to try again. As you increase your range over time and search all of the sixteen lightbulbs, at last you will be able to connect them all in one go and beat the game!</p>\n<p>Be aware: this game is not polished, is subject to numerous bugs and has no audio. Regardless, I hope you give it a little try :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d381041ca80cf744c66f860fb3e3c837.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DutchDave"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
