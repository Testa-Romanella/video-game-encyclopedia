The main twist of the game is that instead of controlling a flat paddle that simply moves left and right across the screen, the player moves a character themselves, and must actively swing to launch the ball.</p>\n\n<p>The player controls their character by using nothing but touch controls, making the game friendly and accessible to those who are not familiar with gamepad controllers. The controls were worked on to be intuitive (hold left to move left, hold right to move right, swipe down to slide, etc.) so as to be easy to pick up. The game has an in-depth tutorial that explains the game to the player interactively, but still keeps part of the game a mystery so that the player remains engaged.</p>\n\n<p>When playing the game, the player\u2019s goal is to break all of the blocks and flip all of the panels on the screen before losing their health to the heart and enemies. If the player gets hit by the heart or an enemy, they lose health.<br/></p>\n\n<p>School project for IGME-580 Spring 2022 at Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: Bailey Chapman (vermontbail)</p>\n<p>UI/UX Programming: John Hayes (ChefKef)</p>\n<p>Art: Noah Hulick (PmMeTheDankMemes)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4b2f81bc0fa433957bd560d5be0ebbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["vermontbail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
