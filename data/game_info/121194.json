As you progress through the mansion as Mads, you'll be faced with many challenges that will test your knowledge, morals and memory. <br/><br/><br/>There are a few things that are important to keep in mind while playing: (BE SURE TO READ THIS SECTION) <br/><br/>1. Click on the hyperlinks, they will give you all possible options of how to interact with an object. <br/><br/>2. Directions you can travel in and hints about visible objects are always at the top of the room description. <br/><br/>3. You will have to use objects on other objects during the course of the game. The terminal command is \"use X on Y\" (subbing X and Y for object names). <br/><br/>Good luck, and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1e4de844c7b27370ecf1a00b6ce111.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Mitch Geddes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
