Use this limited resource wisely! As the game proceeds you will acquire more power cells and thus be able to light up more sectors at any one time.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>- WASD to move <br/></p>\n<p>- L CLICK to toggle power in a sector<br/></p>\n<p>- SPACE to auto-complete lines of dialogue</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>This is our first time participating in Ludum Dare and we had a ton of fun doing so! Challenged ourselves to add some story and character to this one, though we perhaps got a little carried away...</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Rob, Jeremy, Benji, Daniel</p>\n\n<p>EXTRA RESOURCES USED:<br/>- The Shepard Tone (the creepy perpetually-descending music that plays in the shadows) is from 1urker: https://freesound.org/people/1urker/sounds/456929/</p>\n<p>- The wall-thud sound is a cropped and slightly altered version of the track posted by zerolagtime: https://freesound.org/people/zerolagtime/sounds/245033/ <br/>- The White Noise is from jhepkema: https://freesound.org/people/jhepkema/sounds/149445/</p>\n<p>- The lift sound is a cropped version of this track from vacuumfan7072: https://freesound.org/people/vacuumfan7072/sounds/266150/</p>\n<p>- Step sounds are our own foley from a previous jam (GMTK 2019)</p>\n<p>- Everything else was made by us within the jam time limit.</p>\n\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING LD45:<br/></p>\n\n<p>- Unfortunately, we weren't able to submit this\u00a0by the LD45 deadline. We had a nasty build error that took the entire last hour (23:00 - 24:00) to fix, and even then we didn\u2019t entirely manage to fix it\u2026 it was something to do with a null reference caused by adjusting the opacity of the player portraits and dialogue box and took forever to find. We put in a fudgy fix (by disabling this opacity change so the box is always visible and you can\u2019t see who\u2019s talking\u2026) and uploaded to itch.io, but alas, it was too little too late. Not sure if this discounts us from the jam or anything, but we saved and posted on the LD45 website and it seemed to work?! So yeah, sorry if we did something wrong by submitting at about 00:09!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e501d82b5b6b4f2f29e83537cbbbf67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoboPenguin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
