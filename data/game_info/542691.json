Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br/>ROCKET PUNCH is a dynamic, energetic, and most of all goofy motion control game. The year is 20XX and global warming continues to devastate the Earth, the only hope for humanity is to punch the Sun right in the face!<br/>Use your DUALSHOCK\u00ae4 wireless controller in unconventional ways to guide the Rocket Fist through space, punching the faces of old satellites, space cowboys and 80s techno demons as you go.<br/><br/>Inspired by terrible movie and TV depictions of people playing video games, ROCKET PUNCH will have you waving your controller wildly and mashing buttons. Look like a fool whilst playing a vast array of game modes including fishing, dog petting, cooking and even a text-based adventure; but beware - all is not as it seems.
