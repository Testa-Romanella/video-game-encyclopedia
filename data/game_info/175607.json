(except the font)</p><p>I know it has major flows but it runs and I think it's fun so I hope you try it!</p><p>It is written in Java using its default render functions to render because we (as in class) just started to learn Java in school, so I thought maybe someone can learn something from my source as I'm a bit more experienced than them :D</p><p>But like I sayed this was written within 24h so it has major flows like too less contrast or the fact that it is hard to see what is moving so I like to give a few hints:</p><p>You are the sphere with stripes on it!</p><p> You have to click on it with the mouse to control it. </p><p>If you zoom in (+/- Key) you can see a either red or green box surrounding it, if its green you can control it, if it is red its either your base or an enemy's sphere.</p><p>Now the things written within the README file ,because noone is reading it anyways:</p><p>Just double click on the jar file to start the game!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrow Up/Down or W/S or Space/Shift: Resize rope length</p><p>+ / - : Zoom in/out</p><p>M : mute music</p><p>P : Pause/Unpause game</p><p>1-6: Slow down!</p><p>Mouse: Select Sphere</p><p>Space: Next Level,Unpause</p><p>How to play:</p><p>You select one of the moving spheres with the mouse and then</p><p>press W/S to resize the rope so you can hit the enemy's core sphere</p><p>with it to destroy it.</p><p>If you hit an enemy's moving sphere with your own you neutralize it.</p><p>If you hit a neutralized sphere you get control over it</p><p>-Pusty</p><p>I hope you like it! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc7c2a61bd1fe27a298bb4dfde22d21b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pusty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
