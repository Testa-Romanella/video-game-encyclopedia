The game has two endings and was made in a few days using exclusively a creative tool called Mosi, which is available here, on itch, for free\u00a0https://zenzoa.itch.io/mosi (thanks for the tool, Zenzoa, it's really cool ;P Also, please, let its users compose music with more than 5 notes per octave, thanks T_T No hard feelings over this, though ^.^')</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/0526380b617d8b3a39fd8a355c3c9c61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nnaa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
