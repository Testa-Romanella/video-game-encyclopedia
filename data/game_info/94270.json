Things are going swimmingly (except for perhaps her brother\u2019s debt/bootlegging problem and an ominous dream or two,) until a woman comes along asking for a book. Not a library book<em>\u2014</em>that would be too easy<em>\u2014</em>but a book that doesn\u2019t belong in Tetrine\u2019s library. The book turns out to be written in a magical script called Nell marks that only a few people can see, and Tetrine is one of them.</p>\n<p>However, all her life she\u2019s been told in no uncertain terms that letting on that she can see the marks is a Bad Idea. Which is unfortunate, because several people, two of whom have suspicious intentions, find out. A kidnapping and an attempted murder (or two) ensues, and Tetrine\u2019s life will never quite be the same again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c30/c300b984dc74687e0969b8d5202fa0b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sun Labyrinth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
