Jerk.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Also, yeah, I know a Yin-Yang-based theme for this year's global game jam is the first idea EVERYONE thought of and is SUPER unoriginal, but in my defence I barely spent any time on this Jam and just shilled something simple out for the sake of being in the GGJ.</p>\n<p>(I ran out of time so the How To Play button doesn't work in the game)\r\n</p>\n<p>Instructions:\r\n</p>\n<p>Click and drag to rotate the Yin-Yang wheel. Incoming energy spheres will collide with the wheel and change the balance based on which side it hits. Try to main a balance of the two polarities, as the game will end if the Yin and the Yang overlap.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Programming: ME.\r\n</li><li>Design: ME.\r\n</li><li>Visuals: ME.\r\n</li><li>Audio: ME.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Link to the game's GGJ page:\u00a0https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/wheel-balance-6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T07:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc8166c5f0350a4d2198284c89246de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Niblet"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
