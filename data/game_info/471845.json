For now all the billings will be paused, and I highly reccomend you to NOT pledge until I figure it out.

The only difference compared to the AO version, is the lack of adult scenes, the rest is the same.</p>\n<p>Also this project is made by one guy, so... Expect issues?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>(Maybe in the future if that project goes somewhere I'll be able to hire artists and musicians to help me with that...

(Well. A little bit of it. Sorry, cutting corners to release something is better than developement hell!)\r\n</p>\n<p>-Branching dialogue paths. (Or well. An attempt at having that.)<br/></p>\n<p><em>The game is available for PC (Windows, Linux builds might be coming later.) and Android devices, and it's free, there are no microtransactions, ads or tracking either.\r\n</em></p>\n<em>\n<p>Please enjoy!\r\n</p>\n</em></em></em>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em><em><strong><em>System Requirements</em></strong>: (Subject to change.)\r\n</em></em></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n<em><em><em>\n<p>PC <strong>minimum </strong>requirements:</p>\n<p><strong>MONITOR</strong>: A monitor with a resolution of 1280 x 720 at the minimum, ultrawide is supported. 4:3 is not.</p>\n<p><strong>RAM</strong>: At least 2GB of Ram.</p>\n<p><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 was the one I tested it on.
