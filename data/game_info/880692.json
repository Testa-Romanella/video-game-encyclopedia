When he passed away on a cold november day last winter it took me well into spring to gather the strength to clean out his house up in Seneca Falls. As I was rambling through old crates and boxes in the attic (I didn't realise until now Bill was such a collector) I gathered the few items I could spare in an old duffel bag:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- A berret from his tour in Vietnam complete with insignia (101st Airborn Division)</p>\n<p>\u00a0- An old photo of Bill and me as a kid (I guess around 2-3 years old)\u00a0</p>\n<p>- A bottle of vintage Bourbon (Bridgeport, pre-prohibition)</p>\n\n<p>Just as I was about to call it a day and head back to my childhood friend Mike's place to crash for the night - I stumbled upon a weird looking box. It had an air of importance around it. Unassuming but still - luxurious in a way - made of some strange unfamiliar materials. Almost like wood, but not quite? From what I assumed was the back of the box there was a cable sticking out. At the end of the cable was a connector unlike anything I'd ever seen before. It wasn't HDMI, that's for sure.</p>\n<p><strong>Restoring old hardware</strong><br/></p>\n<p>After fiddlig with it for days I had to give up. I was unable to get the hardware running. Just as I was about to scrap the project I noticed that the application logic was soldered right onto the circuit board. By backtracking the connections I discovered something similar to a game loop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I took it to my buddy Nick who used to work at the radio shack back when they knew what they where doing.</p>\n\n<p>After cleaning the deflection coil with some bourbon on a cuetip we were\u00a0able to get the Cathode Ray Tube Display to respond to the manometer readings. We had to replace the anode cap with a spring mechanism harvested from\u00a0a discarded toaster and align the flyback transformer with the neck board. And whattaya know - butter my butt and call me a biscuit - we got it running!</p>\n<p><strong>It's a racing game!\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>And ring my bell if it ain't a fine sample. It has some 3d graphics; one touch gameplay and delightful frustrating mechanics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Online highscore - WFT??</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The weirdest thing is - it seems to be connected to an online highscore table. The mainframe must have been running since the 70's but no one knows its wherebouts. Probably in some forgotten military bunker.</p>\n\n<p>We are happy to be able to ressurect this old gem for you guys. Just download it and make old uncle Bill proud!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b2/9b26ad37563dc7a37556a3e5b5869b11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PapaQuark", "athuroe"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
