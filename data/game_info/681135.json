I'm Hamzeh, a 14 year old app developer that one day hopes to become a successful app developer. I hope you like the game! To be honest I didn't really spend much time developing this app, but I promise that this is the start, and all my other projects will be <strong>WAY\u00a0</strong>better;\u00a0 some will be 3D based games, some will be 2D based but will be great adventure games and I will make sure that all those games will entertain you. Donating would help a lot, since I'm still on a 0 dollar budget I'll need a lot of money to pay for editing apps and game engines, which will really have a big impact on the popularity of the game, since it will have a better game engine to run it, and better app layouts and designs. Itch io is just the beginning, I'll try to upload some of my apps to google play and app store, but it needs a specific SDK for EACH one. They are costly and can reach over $200, so donating will be very helpful. Hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T07:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e34c70393b67ec6f03213d1f87b4502.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HJ3143"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
