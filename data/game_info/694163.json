Not only that, but most of the textures will be revised with each release.</p>\n<p>The general premise of Dream Child is that you're a little kid who slowly realizes the people in his town are disappearing and it's all connected to his lucid dream that he can freely go in and out of, provided there is a bed for him to sleep in.</p>\n<p>It's up to you to rescue your family and the rest of the townsfolk in this action/adventure platformer!</p>\n\n<p><strong>A few noteworthy things/some helpful hints:</strong></p>\n<p>-You can turn on the stereo in the protag's bedroom to listen to music.</p>\n<p>-You can cook the frozen pizzas and the potatoes in the oven.</p>\n<p>-You can swim, but the placement of the protagonist isn't working correctly.</p>\n<p>-You can use all the switches in the house to control the lights and the ceiling fans.</p>\n<p>-You can climb the palm trees to collect coconuts. Very useful for taking out that annoying tiki guy when you have the coconut launcher. ;)</p>\n<p>-Coconuts regrow after a full day has passed.</p>\n<p>-You can climb up the vines near the pirate ship to get back up the Great Wall.</p>\n<p>-For the section where there are several floor switches, you have to have them in the correct order. Look at how they're laid out on the ground and think the opposite.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Some bugs and issues\u00a0that will be fixed soon:</strong></p>\n<p>-Interact Mode (First Person) can only be activated when the player is standing still.\u00a0\u00a0(Fixed,\u00a0 11/9).</p>\n<p>-Weapons might stop working if the game is restarted. You'll have to click on them a few times in the inventory to get them to work again.</p>\n<p>-Item Pickups are persistent. This can cause issues with the weapon hot slots incorrectly displaying weapons when nothing is actually equipped.</p>\n<p>-When you walk up to the bed to sleep, it incorrectly displays an image of a PlayStation circle as the interact button. It should either be the letter F or an image of the Xbox B button, depending on what the current detected input is.\u00a0(Fixed, 11/9).</p>\n<p>-When you bounce on the mushroom guy, you have to jump and make contact with his body while he's in the air. This is actually intentional, but can be incredibly frustrating to get the timing right, so I'm going to just allow the bounce at all times. (Fixed, 11/9).</p>\n<p>-Camera doesn't automatically rotate with player's forward vector. Right now you just freely orbit the camera around the player or if you hold the forward button and move the camera, the player will follow the camera.</p>\n<p>-The quests don't actually work, they're just placeholder buttons.</p>\n<p>-If you're in Interact\u00a0Mode (First Person)\u00a0and begin to climb, the camera switches to a third person view, but the player model stays hidden. (Fixed,\u00a0 11/9).</p>\n<p>-When you fall off the Great Wall, there are vines near the pirate ship that the player can use to climb back up. More vines will be added to various points so the player won't have to backtrack so far. (Fixed, 11/9).</p>\n<p>-I\u00a0disabled the swimming when you're in the dream world because it looked janky. (Fixed, 11/9).</p>\n<p>-Should only have to press one button for all interactions, but this is not the case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PC Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD</p>\n<p>Camera Movement: Mouse</p>\n<p>Interact: F</p>\n<p>Inventory: Tab</p>\n<p>Jump: Space</p>\n<p>Pause: Escape</p>\n<p>Attack Blunt: Mouse Left-Click</p>\n<p>*** The ranged weapon aiming/firing is buggy for pc controls.\u00a0 ***</p>\n<p>Aim Ready Ranged: Mouse Left-Click and Hold (Note: If enemies are present, the player will automatically lock-on to the nearest one.)</p>\n<p>Aim Manual Ranged: WASD</p>\n<p>Attack Ranged: Mouse Right-Click</p>\n<p>*** Very sorry about this, it will be fixed! ***</p>\n<p>Interact Mode (First Person): Mouse Right-Click</p>\n<p>Interact Mode (First Person) Aiming: Mouse</p>\n<p>Interact Mode Pickup/Use: Hold Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Grab: Hold Left Mouse Button\u00a0(While in third person)</p>\n<p>Swap Weapons from Hot Slots: Q</p>\n<p>Note: Mouse movement is not supported in the UI menus yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>XBox Gamepad Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Camera Movement: Right Joystick</p>\n<p>Interact: B</p>\n<p>Inventory: Y</p>\n<p>Jump: A</p>\n<p>Pause: Start</p>\n<p>Attack Blunt: LB</p>\n<p>Aim Ready Ranged: Press and Hold LB (Note: If enemies are present, the player will automatically lock-on to the nearest one.)</p>\n<p>Aim Manual Ranged: Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Attack Ranged: RB</p>\n<p>Interact Mode (First Person): RB</p>\n<p>Interact Mode (First Person) Aiming: Left Joystick</p>\n<p>Interact Mode Pickup/Use: Press and Hold LB</p>\n<p>Grab: Hold LB (While in third person)<br/></p>\n<p>Swap Weapons from Hot Slots: Back</p>\n\n<p>Again, thank you very much for taking the time to play my demo.
