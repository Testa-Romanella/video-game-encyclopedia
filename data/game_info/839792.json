Obligatory 1st Game Jam heads-up.</p>\n<p>This game is about going around and slaying dragons. Nuff said. If you make it far enough, you might even find a special floating dragon head boss for you to either kill or die to. But above all else, the true final boss of this game is the RNG you'll be suffering to.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Left click - Purchase items at the shop (if you have enough gold)</p>\n<p>Right click - Use item on hand (only possible if you have one and are in combat)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Tips</p>\n<p>- Armor upgrades restores your health to max</p>\n<p>- Potions restore your health to max</p>\n<p>- Needles reduces your health by half for more damage</p>\n<p>- Totems are expensive, but revive you when used!
