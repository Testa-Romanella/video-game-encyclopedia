Now, here he stands in the middle of a room somehow related to his past, yet too creepy to evoke in him feelings of nostalgia. This dark, eerie room\u2026 full of birthday decorations, even though the building has long since been deserted. His birthday party from seven years ago, recreated almost to perfection. Its sole purpose? Making him remember that night... that night when he lost his entire self and all his memories.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>The night of his parents\u2019 murders.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And as though this situation wasn\u2019t enough, a Voice, mechanical and almost joyful, proclaims from the other side of the line to be the one behind it all. It continues with nonsensical words, one after the other. Things Michael doesn\u2019t even comprehend. But he does catch the Voice\u2019s parting words. The Voice\u2019s threat. Something about the importance of his friends and to what length he needs to go in order to save them.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is the story of a young man who\u2019s desperately trying to cut himself out of the world surrounding him, and the choice he\u2019s ultimately forced to make to save the few friends he has.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Follow us on twitter for more updates!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec4/ec49232e63f3d8386c3514609bba9c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HangoverCatPurrroduction"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
