However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>You feel the wrap of magic around you, a confused mix of love and hate summoning you to face Merlin once more. Your feelings are mixed, dealing with Merlin always means trouble but the choice is not yours. The magic mist absorbs you transporting you back to his Celtic world.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Celtic Doom\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 65 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:15:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bc/1bc4015e9f409b853f6acbabd50883b9.jpeg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": null}
