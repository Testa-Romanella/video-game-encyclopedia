Incorrectly sorted items, take away points. Simple enough.<br/><br/>If James happens to correctly sort a wheel type that is better than the ones currently fitted on his Jeep, they will be upgraded accordingly!<br/><br/><strong>BeWHEELdering </strong>is part of \"<strong>The Hall Of Highscores</strong>\" on the Games By Nemiz website, where players can challenge eachother across all games released by Games By Nemiz as well as just in specific games or levels.</p>\n<p><strong>BeWHEELdering</strong> can be played on PC, Android and directly in the browser on\u00a0http://gamesbynemiz.com/games/bewheeldering</p>\n<p>Good luck, have fun ;o)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/7752d1d3e4f2bc81c87e0914fb29bc57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games By Nemiz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
