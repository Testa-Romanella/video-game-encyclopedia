The game will be launched in fullscreen with the chosen resolution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0When overriding the default resolution (816x624), maintaining a ratio close to 16:9 is preferred in order to eliminate black bars on fullscreen mode because must modern screens use this ratio. The default override resolution on this plugin is set to 1104x624 because it retains the original height of RPG Maker MV's default resolution, thus avoiding the need to change most plugins, has a ratio very close to 16:9 and is still divisible by 48 (17*3, the default map tilesize number of pixels).<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This plugin is free to be used for non-commercial projects, however, for\u00a0\u00a0usage on commercial projects, please\u00a0donate here, on itch.io,\u00a0the amount specified for this plugin.
