It includes 9 levels consisting of either apples that reduce the players score, AI snakes, obstacles, or a combination of all three.\u00a0 Use WASD to\u00a0eat as many red apples as you can, and avoid the green ones. Eating a total of 5 apples is a level up.\u00a0The game is over when the player eats too many green apples, or hits a wall, obstacle or AI snake. You may just get lucky and win the game if the AI snake eats too many green apples!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27b/27ba2bedf418e43c1bf5af5039bdbe4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jpiano"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
