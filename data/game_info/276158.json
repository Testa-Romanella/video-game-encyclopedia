While constructing the level's design, I followed the 4-Step level design process as follows:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Introduce</strong>: You begin with a small jump. One tiny spike to introduce you to the future world of obstacles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Develop</strong>:\u00a0 More intricate jumps and several more spike obstacles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Twist</strong>: Suddenly there's a moving obstacle you must time correctly in order to continue your journey. And MANY more spikes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Transition/Conclusion</strong>: You finish the level out with having to time two moving platforms to inevitably throw yourself off the cliff to restart the level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong><em>A huge shout out to the following people for contributing to my final level design</em></strong>:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Brackeys</strong>: over-all awesomeness and killer tutorials. Without y'all, I'd be lost.<br/>- <strong>Bayat Games</strong>: the wonderful graphics and super cute character design.\u00a0<br/>- <strong>FMA &amp; Scott Holmes</strong>: fantastic free use music for the background sound.\u00a0<br/>- <strong>My Hubby</strong>: for playing through my game several times and listening to me scream at my code each time it broke.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c87fc9b9dd0af938d2ebe56f77fe83b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bork Enterprises"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
