He loves meeting the unknown, but he's bad at it. Left uninhibited, Hugo would wander around in circles... literally.\u00a0Players must hurl blocks and guide Hugo to the exit of each level. This week, I had so much fun working on this prototype. Recalling the old DOS games from the 80's that I\u00a0used to play, a majority of them were puzzle games, which is what I have created here. Using pixel graphics, the CGA color palette, sliiiightly sticky controls with minimal interpolation, and boops and beeps, I think I've achieved the prompt set before me.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nWASD / Arrow KeysMove blocks vertically or horizontallySpaceHurl a block in a given directionRRestart the levelMMute sound effects&lt; and &gt;Lower and raise volume", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T09:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8daddc7a706001c427bd74a517a36c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
