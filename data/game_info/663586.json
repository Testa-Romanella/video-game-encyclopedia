Light looks very strange in the browser,\u00a0 but that'll\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0problem\u00a0for\u00a0another\u00a0day. <br/></p>\n<p>Best play with full screen -&gt; I just learned, that capturing the mouse doesn't work in HTML5 (or at least it doesn't work the way I tested it under windows) and the controls really suck, if the mouse leaves the window. <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to the extended upload-time, I could add a small fix in time, that captures the mouse, if you click in the game box once the \"action\" starts.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>The models look very cool, that's due to the nice assets by Quaternius.

Thankfully I could figure out, how to bone attache the fork to a bone and animate the weapon a bit independent of the bones. BTW, the animation player rocks, adding function calls at timestamps in the animation is quite an interesting feature.<br/>- I need to work on my \"import assets pipeline\", as well as on keeping a semblance of order in the project files (my assets are all over the place).<br/>- 3d is way harder than 2d - My game is basically just 2d and it still got quite complicated when it came to hit-detection and calculating directions...<br/>----<br/>What I wanted to implement, but didn't work out:<br/>- Catty being more active/nervous to make the game more dynamic.<br/>- Interaction with Elements - Grabbing hay as \"Health potions\" for Catty. Patting her on the back to pacify her.<br/>- more lively surroundings (sounds that \"show\" the flow of time, like belltower ringing, I've seen some grass-like effects that would have been nice to try..).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T08:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17d/17df9bdae645be957349007312b5bf54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ragnar0ek"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
