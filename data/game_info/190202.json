In a very short amount of time we had to come up with a game, then digitize it.</p><p>The original concept for the game was done in groups however, recreating the game digitally was individual. Also, if it wasn't obvious by the name this game is our representation of a more challenging black jack. (Sadly, we couldn't keep 21 as the winning number)</p><p>This game was mainly built for the class assignment. I did have a lot of fun making it even tho its so simple. I may in the future still work on it to create a better computer system and also maybe multiplayer functionality.</p><p>Created using: Twine, and Harlowe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d6835c972b65875dff03c3aa033c71a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zodsmar"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
