Standalone builds are much more stable and are recommended for a proper experience</em></strong><br/><br/>Don't stand too close to a nuclear reactor (DSTCTANR) is a game about not\u00a0standing too close to a nuclear reactor. Standing next to a nuclear reactor usually isnt the best idea. It's even worse when you are left to man that reactor by yourself.<br/><br/> Controls:<br/>Movement: WSAD + Mouse<br/>Pickup:\u00a0 LMB<br/>Screw in panel: Hold LMB (looking at panel)<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Don't stand too close to a nuclear reactor was made for Ludum Dare 49. The game itself took 11 hours (on my clock) to make over 2 days. Had a lot of fun with this one. Hope you all enjoy.<br/>Built and tested on Windows machine, not sure how it'll run elsewhere (I was halfway through making the game when I realised I should probably target web as its LD)<br/><br/>Updates:<br/>-Fixed mouse not unlocking on main menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce3/ce30154d263c053d3ddcbc4914099d82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Zeppelin Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
