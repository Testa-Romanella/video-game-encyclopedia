Instead, you control the environment, to make sure it doesn't crash anywhere. Pull levers, move boxes, and engage in high-speed puzzles.</p>\n<p>Movement: Mouse only</p>\n<p>Developed this little game prototype as a term paper for my bachelor's studies at Kyiv Mohyla Academy. It's quite rough around the edges and I would've done a better job if not a war in my country. But one day... One day I'll finish this...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just some fun background:</p>\n<p>I first designed the game idea in 2018, and me and a couple of classmates made the game on a horrible game engine forgotten by all gods called Cocos2D (the python-based one). Despite the workload being hell on Earth, we managed to make a decent standalone game. And since then it's been my dream to remake the game on a better engine. And this version is an attempt at that. It's not the ONE, but it gave me a lot of experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Design, Unity Development, and Music were all done by me.</p>\n<p>Eternally grateful to\u00a0heyitswidmo for an amazing tileset that sparked this game idea in the first place:\u00a0https://heyitswidmo.itch.io/caves-rails-tileset</p><p>And huge thanks to the og team Tri0 &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc8/bc806e3005b725b697588f2494b66d68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nullmike"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
