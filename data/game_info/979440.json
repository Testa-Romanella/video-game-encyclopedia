As you wake up to the harsh reality of your crash landing, you find yourself surrounded by relentless aliens hell-bent on ending your existence. Your mission: survive against hordes of nightmarish creatures and uncover the secrets of this hostile world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEngage in intense battles against various enemy waves, each presenting a unique challenge which will never stop testing your skills and mobility. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStrategic decision-making is crucial in Stranded Shootout as every level up rewards you with four talent choices. Tailor your space marine's abilities to your playstyle, whether it's enhancing your damage output, increasing magazine size, or speeding up your reload times. The choices are yours to make, and each decision shapes your path to survival.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChallenge yourself to climb the leaderboards with high scores tracked by time, wave, and kills. Your achievements are not only a testament to your skills but also a key to unlocking new and powerful guns. Pick your starting weapon wisely, as unlocking guns requires stars earned through achievements or successful survival missions. (there is only one gun option currently. So you don't have to be that wise when picking the same gun every time)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStranded Shootout offers a dynamic and ever-evolving gameplay experience, where each decision matters and survival is the ultimate goal. Choose your arsenal, face off against the alien onslaught, and see how long you can endure in this gripping interstellar adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote: We made this game in a week. It still needs a lot of love and we hope to give it some more TLC over the next few months. Let us know what we can do to make it better.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T08:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a94/a94c6347d9253a281d989668bedb7759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3 Buffoons"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Going Indie"], "esrb_rating": null}
