I was really hyped about this jam from the minute my friend told me about it. I was in Queensland for the majority of the jam, so I actually spent time outside, which cut out some jam time but oh well.</p><p>Some of the animations were a bit hard to do with the amount of pixels, and I did most of the animations in the last few days and on the plane home, so they aren't perfect, but I think that they do alright.</p><p>Another thing that proved to be more challenging than expected was the balancing, I thought i could just plug in some numbers and some math, but It took a bit more thought than that.</p><p>Although stayed up till 2 am finishing the UI and numbers, I had fun every minute of it, and am pretty proud of the game that came out of it. Love this game jam and would definitely do it again, 100%.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb8/bb82b976eed1458cfb7a6b66d45fe2d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LozzaDawg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
