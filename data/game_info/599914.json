Well, what would happen if things were a bit, different. That's where this parallel universe comes in! In this universe, Daddy Dearest is a Mario fan instead of an ex-rockstar, Skid and Pump and FNAF freaks, Daisy from the Mario series was hired to kill the Boyfriend instead of Pico, Mommy Mearest has an apprentice who just so happens to be Penny from WarioWare Gold. Week 5 takes place during Summer Vacation instead of Christmas, BF &amp; GF get trapped in an SNES instead of a PS1, and so much more! Warning. This mod can get really hard. So make sure you give your fingers some rest from time to time. Enjoy my mod, or something...<br/>Disclaimer for any monetized YouTubers, as far as I'm aware, Bad-Time, Freddy, and Slaughter are the only copyrighted songs in the entire mod. If there are any glitches I missed please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T08:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98b07210630cf91c6d354317d4d77a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dsfan2_PMB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
