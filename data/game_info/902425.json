Accomplished by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on the X and Y signal of the image, then using oscillators to play the corresponding periodic functions. Best experienced with a headphone, as the left side will correspond to the DFT of the X signal, and the right side to the Y signal. Still not perfect, as there will be heavy artifacts when the signal gets too complex.<br/></p>\n<p>Caution: Often, the sound will be in very low frequencies, which if listened to for an extended time can cause distress and ear damage. In such cases, boost the frequencies or stop altogether.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T10:28:27", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy1510"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
