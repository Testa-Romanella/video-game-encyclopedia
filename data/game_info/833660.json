In this game you play as\u00a0Julie, a young girl who wandered off into a cave filled with monsters. Collect rubies to fill up your meter, and then\u00a0use your meter to run faster and avoid enemies. There are also four green\u00a0Blast Crystals around the map, which allow you to release a shockwave that destroys monsters by pressing C or Z. Between each level, you can spend rubies to upgrade your stats to help you better tackle the next level.</p>\n<p>Sound Effect Credits:</p>\n<p>- Impact Sounds\u00a0by Kenney</p>\n<p>- Digital\u00a0Audio\u00a0by Kenney</p>\n<p>- RPG Audio\u00a0by Kenney</p>\n<p>- JRPG Style UI Sounds by KillaMaaki</p>\n<p>- Machine Death Sound by OptimusDu</p>\n<p>Music Credits:</p>\n<p>- On The Run by Zane Little Music</p>\n<p>- Lick The Chorus by Zane Little Music</p>\n<p>- It Takes\u00a0A Hero by\u00a0Zane Little Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/227b789a9acfe9641e6be63189ff634b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thebuddyadrian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
