Created in Game Maker Studio.\u00a0 Thought it'd be fun to share.</p>\n<p>Contains simple platforming, basic attacking, 3 levels, and 3 enemy types.\u00a0Every asset, from art to sfx, is original\u00a0EXCEPT the music, which is borrowed from a popular indie game, \"Night in the Woods.\"\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My line of work is skewed towards art and animation, so forgive me if it's janky. Or if it barely functions. Or if the\u00a0difficulty and balance kinda sucks. It definitely has that highschool student zest to it, but nonetheless it was my first real game project and I'm proud of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fa/4fa6d0c8c5c06bcfac773c33e87f2917.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SaucySpaghetti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
