That&#39;s why there is a free Steam demo! Go give it a try!<br />\nTake the best out of two popular genres, find a good balance between them and make a great game. That\u2019s what CrossCode does. And it works pretty well. You get the puzzles of Zelda-esque dungeons and are rewarded with the great variety of equipment you know and love from RPGs. During the fast-paced battles you will use the tools you find on your journey to reveal and exploit the enemies&#39; weaknesses and at the same time will be able to choose equipment and skills for a more in-depth approach in fighting your enemies.<br />\nCheck the Reviews to see who loves the game. We&#39;re sure you will, too!</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2015-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:10:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd6825467cb0f6a478a016b242d5d247.jpg", "website": "http://www.cross-code.com", "rating": 4.26, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 94, "owned": 925, "beaten": 53, "toplay": 74, "dropped": 40, "playing": 44}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 146, "ratings_count": 135, "suggestions_count": 459, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 137, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Radical Fish Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["WhisperGames", "Deck13", "Deck 13"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
