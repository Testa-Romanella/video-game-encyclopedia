If you go into black, you die and if you reach the red square without collecting all green squares, you die.<br/><br/>Yellow squares teleport you to the next yellow square. Dark green squares require getting over them twice to be collected.<br/><br/>Oh, I almost forgot, after started moving you can't stop. </p><p>This game is a prototype, and if enough people like it, I'm planning to make it into a better and longer game. So, if you play the game, please give feedback. Thank you!</p><p>One Way To Go is open source. If you want to see the source, just download onewaytogo.love, rename it to onewaytogo.zip and unzip it.
