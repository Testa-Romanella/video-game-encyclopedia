There's nothing quite like getting lost in \t\t\tsounds you make yourself, and the sensory immersion of VR makes the experience personal and highly responsive. <br/></p>\n<p>Come see me at the Boston Festival of Indie Games this month! I'll have demos set up with the Oculus Rift and Oculus GO and it'll be a good time! I promise!<br/></p>\n<p>Go For A Walk is currently in development with an expected release in December 2018.
