The Rules are simple. A Deck of Cards\u00a0are shuffled and evenly distributed between you and the AI. Click the Deck to play the card from your deck. The AI will also pull card from its deck.\u00a0if you have a higher value\u00a0card then the AI, then you claim all the cards out, else if the AI has the highest, then it takes all cards out. If its a tie then war has begun. The Next two cards are set down and the third card is played, if your third card is highest, then you take all cards in play. if you lose, then you lose all cards currently in play.\u00a0 if its a tie again, then war is continued. If you run out of cards in your deck, all the cards in your win pile will be shuffled and added to deck. The is over when you run out of cards in your deck and win pile or the AI runs out of cards in their win pile and deck.\u00a0</p>\n<p> For more information about the game, here is a link to a wiki.</p>\n\n<p>Leave a comment if you find any bugs or have any feedback on the game.
