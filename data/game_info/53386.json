The game, published by Interactive Imagination, is based on the collectible card game of the same name.</p>\n<p>Magi Nation was released in the twilight of the Pok\u00e9mon craze, as the popularity of the franchise was beginning to decline. The game managed to sell about 100,000 copies. The game itself was a marketing advancement in order to give attention to Interactive Imagination's flagship card game, Magi-Nation Duel.</p>\n<p>The game was originally released in the U.S., and included a promo card of the game's protagonist, Tony Jones, who becomes a hero in the card game's canonical mythology. The game was later released in Japan exclusively for the Game Boy Advance (titled: \u30de\u30b8\u30e4\u30a4\u30fb\u30cd\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 Majiyai N\u0113shon), with some major details changed - the main character was instead named \"Dan\" and was given spiky black hair, as opposed to Tony's messy blond hair. This was done to give the hero a more Asian-friendly appearance, as Tony Jones represented stereotypical Western teenagers.</p>\n<p>The game keeps a light-hearted mood; the dialog is filled with jokes and references, but maintains seriousness in key situations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e26cc6cbce08a934c2c14ee544e558e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Interactive Imagination"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Epoch Co."], "esrb_rating": null}
