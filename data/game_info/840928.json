{"id": 840928, "slug": "starwalker-into-the-cylinder", "name": "Starwalker - Into the Cylinder", "name_original": "Starwalker - Into the Cylinder", "description": "Are you ready for a Space Survival MMORPG?<br/><br/>Born with random stats in an 80km long space cylinder, improve them through eating your daily calorie intake and defending yourself. Every day survived makes you stronger. You only have 1 life, so choose your clan village wisely.<br/><br/>Life is rough in the space habitat. Technology has been lost and it's all about surviving the the vast landscape of the cylinder and protecting yourself against other clans.<h3>1. GET STRONGER</h3>Players are born into the cylinder with a random set of attributes that are divided up into stamina, strength and agility, which allow them to run faster and for longer distances, defend themselves against attacks by other players and increase the parkour abilities.<br/><br/>1. New players can walk 3 kilometers and run 1 km per day.<br/>2. Every km walked permanently increases stamina by 1%.<br/>3. Every km run permanently increases stamina, strength and agility by 3%<br/>4. Not eating and drinking 1.5kg of food and water per day decreases all attributes by 1%/hour.<br/><br/>The O'Neill cylinder of Starwalker is large. Players that have survived for several days at least, have enough stamina to explore other villages and to get out of the starting area. However, if you are one of the first in an undiscovered village, you will be able to claim it and make use of its resources to stock up your supplies that you can use to acquire followers and other players that join your tribe to protect you and to make you more powerful. However, it can take days of actual gameplay of walking through the vast landscape of the cylinder to reach the next village. Maybe you'll encounter a lonely hut with a friendly stranger to help you out or not, but make sure to have enough berries stocked up before you go on a journey.<br/><br/>Those that survive for weeks to months become very strong characters and can protect their own tribe of 50 players or run an entire village. Trading, scouting, exploring in the village or just living the village life, those things can all be under your jurisdiction. But be aware, you're not the only one who wants to have a say.<h3>2. PICK YOUR BATTLES</h3>Sometimes people will attack, out of fun, out of greed or out of rage. <br/><br/>Fighters with similar attributes will injure each other and suffer from injuries for several days of real playtime.<br/>An injured character is very vulnerable and is likely to be be robbed or killed without a strong support network. <br/><br/>Players only have 1 life. If they die, their character dies, like in the real world. Trying to fight someone always carries a risk of injury or entirely losing your character.<h3>3. SURVIVE AND EXPLORE</h3>The longer a character survives, the stronger, the more rare and the more valuable it becomes. Only 5% of players are expected to survive for longer than a month, only 1% for longer than several months.. Players cannot survive on their own for more than a few weeks, but need to build support network around them to help during times of injury and for protection against players that have formed bandit tribes.<br/><br/>Make sure to use your real-life social skills to deploy in the cylinder and make friends via proximity-based voice chat. If you are a master socializer, you can become King of the Cylinder. If you don't have good social skills, you must learn them. It's the only way to survive.<br/><br/>How long can you survive?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T06:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e743f73e99a475606df1ba22f1f55ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Revox"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Revox"], "esrb_rating": null}
