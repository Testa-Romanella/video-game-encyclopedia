Consequently development is slow, so my suggestion is to buy Scraps now only if you want to play it as it is now.<br/><strong>----------</strong><br/><br/>Scraps: Modular Vehicle Combat is a vehicle combat game where you build your vehicle from parts, and where success lies just as much in designing a well-crafted vehicle as in your combat skills. Design from the chassis up, then pit your creation against humans or AI in a combat arena. When you take out other players, scavenge from their wreckage to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.<br/><br/>Scraps lets you create a vehicle that\u2019s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons \u2013 that\u2019s okay. Maybe it doesn't need an engine because it moves by firing its cannons backwards. You decide what you drive.<br/><br/>Your design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle. Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet. Easily host your own LAN or Internet games. Using the Scraps demo version, your friends can join a LAN game even if they don't own the full game.language Note:The only complete language at this time is English, but partial in-game volunteer translations are selectable for Russian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, French, Swedish, and Polish.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cdd66a96e86295288474b00e2250207.jpg", "website": "http://www.scrapsgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 422, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Moment Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moment Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
