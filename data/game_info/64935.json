Our scope was ambitious but we made it happen! As we continue our accelerated degree programs at Full Sail, we will likely put any spare time we have into future projects. For that reason, please consider this project complete and see past the \"known-shippable\" bugs if and when you find them.<br/>Thank you all for your continued support!<br/><br/>P.S. Steam Achievements and Trading Cards coming eventually! pls don't hold your breath, but it will most likely, probably happen at some point in the future! (after graduation)<br/><br/>Love,<br/>     BrokenDinosaurStudios", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T11:58:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ac/3aca8fff46136c733afe3b1d699d93f9.jpg", "website": "https://www.brokendinosaur.com/", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 113, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 2, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 316, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Patrick O'Connor", "Joshua Suskalo", "Christian Hall", "Arthur Parker", "Dorsey Ledger", "Natalie O'Connor", "Landon Creech", "Nathan Andre", "Cassandra Doeinck", "Nicholas Kovacevich"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Broken Dinosaur Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
