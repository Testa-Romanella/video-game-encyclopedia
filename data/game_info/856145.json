I\u00a0wanted to make it into a little robot that hovers around the character, but ran out of time.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Turn up the Heat:\u00a0The penguins have turned up the heat to prevent global cooling due to their sun dying. They are great at what they do and have little restraint so they turned it into a supernova on accident. Now it's time to run!</strong></p>\n<p>So here's the lowdown. You're a Space Penguin. Your stupid Space Penguin society tried to combat global cooling by re-heating the sun.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>It worked. It worked REAL GOOD. Some may say too good, but they would still be grammatically incorrect.</p>\n<p>So, now the sun is exploding and you have to get to your ship parked conveniently at the edge of the solar system. Not sure what your'e going to do after that, but I only had a week to make this game so I'll leave it to your imagination. You'll probably be fine, live happily ever after, and all that.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\n<p><em>How do I get to my ship?\r\n </em></p>\n<p>Easy go right until you get to the edge of the solar system.</p>\n<p>The Controls are simple: \"D\" key moves you clockwise to the planet you're currently on. \"A\" key does the opposite. Space bar jumps, but you have to be on a planet. If the controls don't work super well, yup.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>What's my multi-tool do?\r\n </em></p>\n<p>Standard issue gravity driver multi-tool aka your mouse buttons, can change the gravity of any planet hit.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>But only one at once because it's a budget version.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>\"Right click\" is the mass driver and will increase planetary mass (Moons act like planets, Planets act straight cray),\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>\"Left click\" is the mini-driver and will decrease planetary mass (Moons stop interacting with anything, planets become Moons)\r\n </p>\n<p>Use the planets to get to the end of the solar system before you're overtaken by the dangerous scary fire! Why are you reading this!?
