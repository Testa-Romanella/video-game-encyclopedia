I recommend downloading the Window's version for the optimal experience!</p>\n<p>The Scouring of Shadowend Manor is a top down action/horror game centered around your attempted escape of a cursed manor. The objective is to navigate the dark mansion with a flashlight to\u00a0collect all three keys and make it back to the entrance to escape. Ghosts will be encountered along the way and can be warded off with the flashlight. The weaker the flashlight, the longer it takes to ward them away so be careful with your flashlight usage!</p>\n<p>The game features dynamic lighting (only in Windows version) allowing for a more atmospheric and spooky experience, and procedural generation allowing for unique experiences each time you play.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Developer/Designer/Artist:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>John Wolz</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Testers:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kenzie Cude</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Bradford Doughty</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/311a60924fd7a59294c7cbd5d225635a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonrador"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
