What's the function of a galaxy? I don't know if our life has a purpose and I don't see that it matters. What does matter is that we're a part. Like a thread in a cloth or a grass-blade in a field. It is and we are. What we do is like wind blowing on the grass.\u201d \r\n<p>- Ursula K. Le Guin, <em>The Lathe of Heaven<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Pleasure Without Knowing</em> is a one-weekend prototype about ecology and nonhuman perspectives. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>This game requires sound and a controller with vibration motors (\"rumble\"). </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Before you begin playing, set your controller down on a table. I recommend putting something soft between your controller and the table, like a cushion or a folded piece of fabric. Rest your hands lightly on the face of the controller during play. You may find it easier to stand.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, it helps to be curious.</p>\n\n<p>Designed and developed by Gil Lawson.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:17:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45d238e1aad7652cffa556f0b95b22a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gewl"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
