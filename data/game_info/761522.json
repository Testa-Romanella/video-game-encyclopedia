{"id": 761522, "slug": "cleric-wanted", "name": "Cleric Wanted", "name_original": "Cleric Wanted", "description": "<p><strong>Summary :</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a game in which you play as a Cleric that just arrive in a small village. There aren't enough clerics to go around so everyone wants to join your party.</p>\n<p>Recruit your party and go into the dungeon trying to **heal them until they inevitably die**. Well the only thing that matters to you is your own life, so don't forget to get out before you die too.</p>\n<p><strong># Input :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Everything is playable with the mouse</strong>. For combat you can also use Q/A, W/Z, E and R to cast your spells.</p>\n<p>You need to select your target by clicking them at the top of the Battle screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Context :</strong></p>\n<p>Haven't finished a Ludum dare in a while so I'm glad to be back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I actually wasn't aware it was happening so I started about 10 hours after. And I started with another idea that got fully scrapped after a few hours of working on it. This is basically a <strong>30 hours project</strong>. Fun times =)</p>\n<p>The original plan was to have way more content : Enemies and party members, spells, add items (the code is mostly there). And have multiple dungeons. But that's a scope problem and I can always add more later.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for reading and playing</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T08:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/373/373ea22e0c6aa15641eba4fb3d62adee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Garazbolg"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
