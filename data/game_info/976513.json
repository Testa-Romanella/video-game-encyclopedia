This is a known issue with the Unity game engine. If using a keyboard we recommend picking and using ONE shift key on either side, and then another key to control the other flipper such as S, L, CTRL or Tab.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T14:09:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27e/27e1cbd60f4dbbe0ba5a0092b35a6f6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 466, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pinblend Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Pinblend Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
