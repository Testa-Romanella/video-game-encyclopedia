The game is made with Unity.</p>\n<p>The theme was <strong>bubbles </strong>and the limitation was \"<em>You are your own ammo</em>\".</p>\n<p>In the game, the player is an organism whose allergic to air which indirectly makes bubbles deadly to the player.\u00a0Fortunately, evolution allowed for protective spikes which can be used to pop bubbles without harming the organism. Though the spikes get destroyed in the process.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is either to survive as long as possible or get as many score points as possible or both ( Your choice ).</p>\n<p>The spikes can serve as the game ammo since they can be replenished. They are directly\u00a0( somewhat ) controlled by the player thus staying close to my interpretation of \"You are your own ammo\".</p>\n<p>Any feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T05:31:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f45d47bc954e240471ef5e73f66172a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["yetanotherdeveloper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
