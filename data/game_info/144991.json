Obviously you can only move forward through open tunnels and not cave walls.</p><p>The E, R and T keys are used to use your food, drink and fuel items to replenish your vital hunger, thirst and temperature bars. </p><p>You can gain more food, drink and fuel by finding and picking up mushrooms with the space bar.</p><p>If any of your vital bars reach 0 you die, then you find out how long you managed to survive for (as a matter of turns).</p><p>Good luck, thanks for playing, and look forward to it being less shit in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcfa2f3d87d3ee0d819e85dbe2585ca3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Michael Stout"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
