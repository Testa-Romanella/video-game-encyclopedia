Be careful though! Not all the chickens want to be disturbed.\r\n\n<p><strong>Post submission hour update</strong>: Fixed a bug where no audio would play. Original upload and fixed version are both available on itch.io.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Post-LD Update 2:</strong> Removed the development console from the build. Whoops!</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Grab the virgins with [Space], and bring them to the top of the volcano while dodging fireballs. Once you reach the very edge of the volcano opening, throw them in with [Space] to calm the volcano.<br/>The barrels will either spawn a chicken, which can be used to absorb 1 hit by a fireball, or the barrel will stun you for a short period.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0WASD or Arrows - Move</li><li>\u00a0Space - Pick up/throw virgins, open (?) barrels</li></ul>\r\nTools Used:\r\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Visual Studio 2017 Community w/ Resharper</li><li>Gimp 2.0</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>https://www.dafont.com/modern-sans.font</li><li>https://www.dafont.com/flat-earth-scribe.font</li><li>http://tones.wolfram.com/generate</li></ul>\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>It's supposed to be portrait mode, which doesn't look great with the default resolutions the unity player provides</li><li>You can get caught on the seams between houses</li><li>The chickens will get caught on the houses</li><li>You can walk off the \"side\" of the volcano up at the top</li><li>Barrels can spawn in houses</li><li>It's really not obvious how to play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b74de4285f054889894ea98567a16a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ductoman16"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
