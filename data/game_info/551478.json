A breakout game with a twist!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Version: v1.0.1</strong></p>\n\n<p>After months of development, we're finally ready to show you what we've made! Mina Miner: Dig Deep follows a similar structure to breakout, but with unique blocks, powerups, hazards, and challenges! After you've beaten Adventure Mode, try the levels in Party Mode for a randomized version of the level! If that's not enough, you can create your own levels and share them! Or further quench your thirst for victory in the multiplayer VS arena! Oh, and did I mention this game works on mobile?</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy our game! We'll update the game with fixes and requested features for a while, but we're already planning a much different, way cooler sequel!
