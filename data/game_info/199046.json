{"id": 199046, "slug": "conversations-on-the-spectrum", "name": "Conversations on the Spectrum", "name_original": "Conversations on the Spectrum", "description": "<p>This game was created as a midterm project for the Intermediate Game Design course at NYU, summer 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Autism has a way of making even everyday tasks difficult. Social interaction becomes a juggling act, and you find yourself running through a checklist. Am I making enough eye contact?\u00a0Am I making TOO MUCH eye contact?\u00a0Am I fidgeting too much?\u00a0Am I talking about the right things?\u00a0Am I staying on topic? Am I letting the other person talk?\u00a0How's my eye contact? Wait, what did they just say?</p>\n\n<p>My experience as a person on the Autism Spectrum is something I\u00a0have addressed in games before, but it remains a plentiful source of inspiration. I was recently describing my struggles in making and maintaining conversation, and it clicked in my head just how difficult the experience sounded. My goal in creating\u00a0<em>Conversations on the Spectrum</em> was to illustrate for the player this difficult experience.</p>\n<p>This was an interesting game for me to make. I haven't ever designed a full web game before - everything up to now has been downloadable. Creating a dialogue system was an interesting challenge, and I\u00a0believe (given the limited time I\u00a0had) that I\u00a0modestly succeeded. There's still a lot I would like to do to this game. Increase the complexity of the dialogue system, really force the player to be a more active participant in the conversation, maybe change up the art design a bit...but that will have to come in the next iteration.</p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Banana Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong><br/><strong>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</strong><br/><strong>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100269d961d25d9678c4ad504f0bfe1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Octopi with Hats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
