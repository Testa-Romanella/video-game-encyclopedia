Even so, she'd like to always give her fullest whenever the need arises. Join her as you discover what lies beyond the veil of formation.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Magical Girl Game Jam 6, and was the first game developed by Devekut Studios. It's intended as a pilot episode of sorts for our future endeavors. If you liked it, keep an eye out!</p>\n\n<p>While this game is meant to be an (almost) complete chapter, there may be minor updates, bug fixes, and secrets, especially before the Metroidvania Month jam.
