Eliminate or completely block your opponent to win.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>----------------<br/>The game is played on a 4x4 grid.  Each side starts with 8 pieces on the board.<br/><br/>The goal is to reduce your opponent to a single piece or to block them so they cannot move.<br/><br/>Piece move in one of two ways:<br/>1) Slide a single space horizontally or vertically to an empty spot on the board.<br/>2) Jump horizontally or vertically up and over one of your own pieces to land on and capture an opponents piece.<br/><br/>Because the entire board is filled at the beginning of the game, the first move will be a jump &amp; capture.<br/><br/>In single player mode, the difficulty level will automatically increase or decrease as you win or lose.  You can also manually adjust the difficulty level and then lock it into place to prevent it from automatically adjusting.<br/><br/>Note that in this game, the AI does not play perfectly, even on the \"Impossible\" difficulty setting.  Sorry about that.  I'll try to improve this in a future update.<br/><br/>------------------<br/><br/>This game is supported by iAds.
