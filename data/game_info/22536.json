Freefall is a minimal arcade game about falling endless through a world that keeps twisting and morphing around you. Sit back, relax, and turn up the volume for some mind-boggling, hair-tearing, patience-wearing \"Game Over\" action. Dive in head-first and get ready for the real party.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe goal is simple: don't hit anything. But it may not be that simple, as the world starts closing in around you, pulsating in time with the music while simultaneously starting to pulsate to the beat of the music. Inspired by games like Terry Cavanagh's Super Hexagon, Freefall will take you to a surprisingly zen-like state of mind as you navigate through its endless canals.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffe4a5007d4fd1345b609871c726c9eb.jpg", "website": "https://freefall.space/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shockk"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Shockk"], "esrb_rating": null}
