A long time ago there was a castle and you are tasked with restoring it. The restoration process is quite expensive though!</p>\n<p>You can construct buildings, which will help the community of your town prosper and give money for castle restoration. On each turn, you throw a dice. Depending on the dice value, some buildings are activated and pledge money to the town hall.</p>\n<p>Beware though, all buildings except town hall <strong>decay over time</strong>! One building can only be activated a fixed amount of times before it falls apart.\u00a0You need to manage between saving money for the castle restoration and keeping the town's infrastructure working.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Made for GMTK Game Jam 2022.
