Your goal is to survive the journey across the ocean (so far 2 levels). As time passes, you would get hungry, so you have to eat various food. Firstly, you can eat algae. It is very nutritious and also common. Secondly, you can encounter some swimming shrimps. They aren't as nutritious as algae, but they contain valuable chitin. As you grow up, you are running out of space in your crab shell. Luckily, you can make it bigger if you eat enough shrimps!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4e/c4e6758b7e445e36540f6d96807e3cdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["maoap"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
