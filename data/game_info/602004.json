You are a bumbling potion shop apprentice with a bad-tempered, alcoholic boss. Even though you know you shouldn't, you often cover for the blacked-out Potion Master. But one day, you spoil a potion, and start a war. Now you must use your potion-making skills to bring peace to the land, or get filthy-rich through war-profiteering. In the words of Potion Master Al himself, you'd be surprised at the influence one little potion shop can have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dca/dca27dce3159d0bb43a2f3e586c1d570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NoxiousFumes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
