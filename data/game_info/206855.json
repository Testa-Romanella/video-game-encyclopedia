As a kid, I was lucky enough to travel quite a lot, and I have been in many museums as a result. The one trait that they all seem to share was a feeling of intense, almost aggressive boredom. So, my brother, father, and I planned out elaborate heists and methods to steal art rather than appreciate it as my mother intended. I really enjoyed planning those out when I was young, spotting cameras, methods of entry, and imagining the ways I could use them, and so I wanted to make a game reminiscent of those planned heists.</p>\n<p>I almost always enjoy coding games. I will happily chug along learning new languages to solve problems, how to use raycasts to move the player, and how to have several cameras rendering simultaneously. I like to think I am pretty good at those aspects. But when it comes to Maya, I am clueless. Ideally in the future I will be working on a team where my strengths as a programmer can be emphasized, and my gaps in the development of assets can be filled by other members.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac3a94dccd7ac7df37c6d193079187dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rialc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
