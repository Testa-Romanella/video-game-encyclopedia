{"id": 415081, "slug": "turtle-garden-alpha-demo", "name": "Turtle Garden (Alpha Demo)", "name_original": "Turtle Garden (Alpha Demo)", "description": "<p>Turtle Garden was originally built to be an Animal Crossing esque game about cooking food for tourists who came to visit the town, and running errands for the other turtle residents. The project had a bad case of feature creep though and with the upcoming release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I've decided it's a good enough time to put this project on hold. I learned a lot from it, but it's time to set my sights on more manageable projects. Right now, the painting and photography aspects of the game are the most functional features, so I've decided to put those in to check out. I want to let anyone who wants to play this game and explore the bones of the world I wanted to create at least check it out. Have fun.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>BUG NOTES: (1) Photos won't load in the album until you reload the game, but you will lose all progress in delivering flowers to Painter Turtle\u00a0on reload. If you're good, and you just wanna see your photos though, just reload the the game, and the photos should work. (2) Talking and character states seem easily broken. As long as Painter Turtle takes the flowers and new paint colors appear, things should be working OK.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS; The trees, and the water and\u00a0ground textures are by Staggart Creations.
