While I have participated in a few game jams I have never submitted one of my games, and often ignore the deadline to keep working on them for a long time. However, the strong deadline in this case helped with the creation as I needed to make more creative solutions and mechanics over lots of content, which usually makes the game more fun in my experience. Great job\u00a0to Mark Brown and his team!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:45:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd187e378ceb578bdea38d9bc7633a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GavGrub"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
