The optimal distance is dependent on your eyes and ability to focus. When correct, the center display should be clear.<br/><br/>- Another method is to hold the display about 12 inches from your eyes, and hold your hand perpendicular to your display about half way between your eyes and the display. Move your hand closer or farther from the display until with each eye closed you only see one of the images. Then when both eyes are open, you should find it easier to focus within the display. Once you have focused on the display, you should be able to remove your hand.<br/><br/>- In general, you need to relax your eyes and focus within the display in order to see the effects.<br/><br/>- Last, some of the population has difficulty focusing on Stereographic targets, however most testers have been able to enjoy stereographic effects with practice.<br/><br/>Write to us with your 3D Stereographic requests.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T05:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5b1804426b1f657da7444bbf480e8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Snow Storm Software"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["SLY Industries"], "esrb_rating": null}
