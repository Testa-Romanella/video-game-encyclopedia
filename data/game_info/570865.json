The player will therefore try to keep the zone or take it back from the opponent by going over it.  \r\nFor this they can shoot themselves (kill the opponent who will reappear a few seconds later). Players can also collect coins to buy potions in the \"shop\" to boost their abilities for a limited time. \r\nThey can also hide and play with the walls to win. Since there are not two mice on a computer for aiming, there is an automatic aiming system. \r\nOrders :  \r\nBlue player: \r\n- d: go right \r\n- g: go left \r\n- r: go up \r\n- f: go down \r\n- space: shoot \r\n- h: open and close the shop \r\n- e: buy shield potion \r\n- t: buy potion of life \r\n- c: buy speed potion \r\n- v: buy damage potion  \r\nRed player: \r\n- right arrow: go right \r\n- left arrow: go left \r\n- up arrow: go up \r\n- down arrow: go down \r\n- the point of the numeric keypad: shoot \r\n- + of the numeric keypad: open and close the shop \r\n- 2 from the numeric keypad: buy shield potion \r\n- 1 from the numeric keypad: buy potion of life \r\n- 3 from the numeric keypad: buy speed potion \r\n- 4 from the numeric keypad: buy damage potion", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daefee3be503a561a33ae04a99858a41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BonBonDragon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
