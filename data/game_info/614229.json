I just modded and added many features and designs.</strong><br/><br/><strong>I don't recommend playing this game in fullscreen due to an FPS issue that I still need to resolve. You can resize the navegator zoom, enter in full screen mode and then exit it to fix the game auto-resize system.</strong><br/><br/>I loved this game so much, that I decided to give an upgrade and I\u00a0modified many features of the original version like the ones bellow:<br/><br/><em>- Level Up and\u00a0Skill Tree Upgrade systems.<br/>- Added 2 unique levels and 3 new safe rooms.<br/>- Added more enemys and traps in all levels.<br/>- Changed the Itens value and bonus in the shop<br/>- Loop system when finish the game, adding more difficult and mantaining some bonus\u00a0</em><br/><br/>I taked <strong>5 days to finish</strong> all this. Seems few modifications, but I was an hard learning and also a good challange of skill\u00a0and programim logic.\u00a0<br/><br/>Hope you like it, any questions, just write in the comments!<br/><br/><em>(PS.: I don't plan to make more updates, unless the game get more famous)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:20:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533d18e9c2432b58bb4080431a5fcb24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vitor C."], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
