This action-packed, death-dodging puzzle game has a twist: it\u2019s in double vision.</p>\n\n<p>Dual realities test your powers of perception, as you simultaneously negotiate the primary world on the left of the screen and its reflection on the right. As you race to reach new high scores, beware! Each level has its fair share of hazards and if your reflection dies, so do you.</p>\n\n<p>Climb up through the levels as you test your puzzle-solving skills, your reflexes and your sheer determination. Sprint to avoid bullets and deadly lasers whilst figuring out how to reach the exit. Avoid being crushed to smithereens as you guide a box to its destination. Find the escape path... and at the same time be alert for the dangers in the world beyond the mirror. You\u2019ll need eyes in the back of your head. Can you complete the game without taking a single death?</p>\n<p>Project Mirrored is currently a work in progress and is in alpha stage. This first alpha release is free and open to public testing. The final version of the game will be released here on itch and on Steam for a fee.\u00a0Any comments and feedback are welcome, please leave them below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d914af37ac44bcd06c952ffd2f19e0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dogsnake Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
