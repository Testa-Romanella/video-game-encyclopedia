The style of the game is influenced by old graphics trend (PSX games etc). You play as a part timer in a restaurant. You wash dishes, take out trash, pump the toilets and organize the table tops. Restaurant manager calls and gives instructions through out the game. Check your notes to learn today's tasks or if you don't know what to do next.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple and doesn't require any skill at all. You walk and interact with objects and that's pretty much all the mechanics in the game. Visual and sound effects can be triggering for some players, so beware.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You are broke, and forced to work as a part-timer dishwasher in a sushi restaurant.<br/><br/>You are dissatisfied with your job, and your boss is unhappy with you.<br/>You cannot quit, and your boss cannot fire you.<br/>Because you are unable to find another job, and your boss cannot find another employee.<br/>Because nobody wants to work in this restaurant.<br/><br/>You may be wondering why. It is up to you to uncover the answer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> Do your tasks<br/></li><li>Your manager will give you more than dish washing tasks. Complete them without questions.<br/></li><li> When the power goes out, use the fuse box (duh)<br/></li><li> Try not to listen to the unusual sounds<br/></li><li> Don't look outside too much<br/></li><li> If you are in trouble, arm yourself and <strong>don't move.</strong></li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-04T02:57:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/5428964258477b2c74f9ca21cba489fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Diakamos"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Studio Diakamos"], "esrb_rating": null}
