You serve the inhabitants of the physical realm, and help keep a balance between the physical and spiritual realm. You can meditate to shift into the spirit realm and calm dark spirits or commune with elemental spirits to provide the physical world with fire / water / growth. Both realms physically sit on top of eachother, so where you perform your actions matters - as the realms are mirrored.<br/><br/>Created for Epic Megajam 2022 by BrainoidGames, Spacey3d and HonestDanGames.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T05:57:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7a313297e7551ad9bfb4c148e916290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brainoid", "HonestDan", "spacey3d"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
