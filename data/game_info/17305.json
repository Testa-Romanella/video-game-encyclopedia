Bottomless ditches of death. And a demented woman with an unfortunate affinity for bad puns at the most inappropriate times gunning for your death. As if that wasn't bad enough, your soul has been trapped in a doll courtesy of the aforementioned 3-in-1 mind games playing, cold blooded killing machine, and psycho-lunatic of a lady. <br/><br/>The Puppet Master is a puzzle game that is bound to test your ability to think out of the box. While being severely limited in many aspects by the fact that you're imprisoned in half a pound of cotton and felt made into the vague likeness of a human being, you are otherwise granted the Hogwarts worthy ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. A skill that, if used well, just might save your life. <br/><br/>An exhaustive amount of meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions are vital in the survival of the game. Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back. It's a game of control or be controlled.AMS Game Development Association<br/>The Puppet Master is distributed under the AMS Game Development Association, a student run game development club located in the University of British Columbia. Every year, members of AGDA get together and make new games, mixing in our collective talent and creative efforts to make fun, engaging games that are hard to put down. Our goal is to work towards expanding our knowledge of the tools, techniques, and processes used in video game development.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f8/6f866e34632ab67cf5fc329b139bdc4c.jpg", "website": "http://amsgda.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 143, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AMS Game Development Association"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["AMS Game Development Association"], "esrb_rating": null}
