To have it diagnosed means that the condition is likely to be apparent enough to others to have oneself checked. In dementia, a portion of the brain shrinks and dies, yet the person likely will live on for many more years. Many of them look like any of us, until they are at the last stages.<br/><br/>By and by the affected person will have greater and greater difficulty in remembering things and performing daily tasks like reasoning, the inability to use the right word,\u00a0cooking (when one used to cook well), walking, general balance, wearing of clothes properly, and even bathing and swallowing. Cognitive decline is a common result. Many also get irritated easily and may also become more aggressive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Proper balanced diet, rest, and exercise becomes more important. There are good days and bad ones.</p>\n<p>Let this traditional game of snakes and ladders remind us that despite the ups and downs in life, dementia or not, we can still move on in life... until we eventually can't and succumb to it.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>TO PLAY:<br/></p>\n<p>Up to 4 players can play. A player can be a Human, or be played by the Computer.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>A randomly chosen player will start the game. Each player take turns to throw the dice. If the dice didn't land properly, a re-throw is done.\u00a0If a player lands at the foot of a ladder, he ascends to the higher square. If he lands on the head of a snake, he slides down to its tail.</p>\n<p>To win, a player needs to reach square 100. He can only proceed if his throw is the same or less than the number of moves needed to move forward. He will not move if he throws a number that is greater than the number of remaining moves. Once a player wins, the whole game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T12:59:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bc9f0c522d8f28ee02e59362f9606c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andesitch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
