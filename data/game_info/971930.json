{"id": 971930, "slug": "blockjump-2", "name": "BlockJump", "name_original": "BlockJump", "description": "BlockJump is a difficult platformer game with the idea that you replay sections of the game to try and beat it faster with each attempt. There are various ways to beat almost every level and some routes require you to master the mechanics of the game to beat them in quick succession.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are Extras which keep BlockJump's core principles but places them into a unique challenge for the player. Extras include:<br/>\r\n    -  Evasion:  A hardcore bullet hell<br/>\r\n    -  Hyperspeed:  You play a set of unique levels whilst everything, including yourself, moves extremely fast.<br/>\r\n    -  Coming Soon:  This will be added to the game once I can think of a 3rd Extra<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBlockJump is a simple, yet difficult, game - this is by design to give a retro (or old-school) feeling. Many games are quite easy these days, but BlockJump ensures you have a challenge to overcome.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T06:33:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e60/e60b5b611d4f209e00adc36f02303ccd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Pieterse"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Pieterse"], "esrb_rating": null}
