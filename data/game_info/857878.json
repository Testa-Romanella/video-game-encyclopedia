You must make use of the cat\u2019s abilities (including walking, knocking obstacles over with their paw, hiding and collecting items) in order to make a seamless escape from the level back to their hideout. This game contains many stealth elements inspired by a myriad of different games, however,\u00a0 inspired by a real-life cat and its cheeky behaviour.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Siyathandana Nontolwana (Level Designer)</p>\n<p>Linda Sumbu (Art Director)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T07:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2d/b2db373dd75a94a6431284201a9a4859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stud"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
