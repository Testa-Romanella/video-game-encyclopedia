Make your way up to party city through the island\u2019s jungle, desert and frosty hideout, destroying their structures in the most spectacular way to earn maximum stars and retrieve the stolen eggs. Take the slingshot into your own hands to fire off your favorite Angry Birds at structures that seem like they are in your actual environment, whether it be your home, your office or outside at the park. <br/><br/>With AR, you can physically walk around structures overlaid onto objects in your own environment to find weak elements, identify different angles for the best accuracy, as well as uncover hidden surprises in order to take on the green pigs, earn more points and unlock more content.
