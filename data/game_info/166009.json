It has 4 endings, some easter eggs... It can be finished in one sit, there is a LOT of text, so save everytime you are able to walk. It's my first game, I'm open to tips, coments, etc... Hope you enjoy! If you run into a bug, feel free to coment here =D I'm SO TIRED, I'm gonna lay down now, bye.<br/></p><p>UPDATE MAY 2016 Hi everyone!

I would like to thank your support! The game is almost done! I completely re-did the script so is more robust and inclusive for people who didn't watch the show, Silas now is 3x bigger with some easter eggs... the game programming is almost done, im a little behind in the art and music part but already have some done! If you wanna be a beta player please let me know, see you guys soon!<br/></p><p>Game based on the first season of the web serie Carmilla (watch on youtube, it's awesome!), it's mostly for the fans, since it doesn't have much explanation... I tried to explore the parts of the show that we didn't see, like other parts of Silas and stuff, there is also some choices the player can make. I hope you have fun, and let me know what you think! You can find me on tumblr at http://carmillarpg.tumblr.com/ I'll upload the full game as soon as it's done, thanks for playing!</p><p>PS: I'm looking for a beta to check my grammar, since english is not my first lenguage, if you can help me, let me know!
