Due to technological progress in the field of robotics, intelligent drones have been deployed in many public locations to ensure the citizens' safety. These are named \"AFS\", short for \"Autonomous Flying System\" and are produced by Mechorp Ltd., one of the biggest and most powerful companies in the field of engineering.<br/><br/>The population's reception to those new forms of surveillance has been surprisingly warm, though this blind trust is soon to be broken. <br/></p>\n<p>On the 17th of August 2019, a group of activists who call themselves \"WaveRiders\" and who fight against the introduction of drones in public spaces becomes the center of attention as the WaveRiders decide to hijack drones to show how much of a threat those machines can really be. As a result, the hijacked AFS are going haywire. <br/></p>\n<p>Our main heroine is Emily Reed, a student who attends engineering classes at university and who built her own little remote-controlled mecha in her spare time. Emily lives very near the hijacking spot and with the police finding it difficult to deal with the gravity of the situation, she is the best chance to put an end to this crisis!<br/><br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/0249c8533a450abd44294a027aaa8f4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["M.Knight"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
