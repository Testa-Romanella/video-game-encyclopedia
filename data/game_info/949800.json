The goal was to develop a museum. I had the idea to create a museum that would make use of teleportation to take the player into an expanded environment without them realizing it at first. To enter one of these environments, the player must view one of the information boards in the main room. The name Edward Mitchell was chosen because he was the first writer to mention a teleportation device.<br/></p>\n<p>There are three exhibits in this museum. The first is about the Emu war that occurred in Australia in 1932. The exhibit\u00a0includes three essential elements from the events of the emu war, an old truck, an emu, and a Lewis light machine gun. The environment the player can travel to through the emu war panel imitates the outback and includes animated versions of the emu models surrounding the truck with the machine gun mounted on it. The viking exhibit includes a hut and some examples of viking weaponry. I decided to build a village as the expanded exhibit for the vikings and included versions of the weapons shown on the information panel that are able to be picked up by the player. The dinosaur exhibit depicts a fight between a t-rex and a triceratops. I designed the expanded exhibit to showcase the cretaceous period as accurately as I could, including vegetation that would have been prominent at the time, such as ferns and tall conifer trees.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>Left Click - Grab object<br/>Right Click - Drop Object<br/><br/>Assets from Unreal Engine Marketplace, Sketchfab, CadNav, PolyHaven, ShareTextures, and AmbientCG</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/6609cc163381a7dc584e205dd5c0e9cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheHammerSV"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
