The sounds are then placed across the eight speakers using GRM Spaces.</p><p>Buy the music at https://shop.conditional.club/album/brostep-in-the-style-of-florian-hecker</p><p>Music: rkss<br/>Game: Calum Gunn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80b6146e96620c327c5e0583eef812ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Conditional"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
