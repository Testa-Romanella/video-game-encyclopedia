Born from a scientific mishap, they wander aimlessly and increase in number. If too many gather in one place, there will be <em>explosive</em> consequences. At least we can keep it under control!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>* A/D - Movement<br/>* W/Space - Jump<br/>* Mouse - Aim<br/>* LMB - Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/>* You have 5 minutes before the whole lab blows to pieces!<br/>* Shoot the specters to gain watts!<br/>* The more watts you gain, the more abilities you will gain!<br/>* Watts also allow you to open doors and activate machines!<br/>* Get as many watts as possible then leave before it's too late!</p>\n<p><strong>Current High Score</strong><br/>by @SmollBeanSavage<br/></p>\n<p>This one came out really nicely and it might be my favorite gm48 entry to date.
