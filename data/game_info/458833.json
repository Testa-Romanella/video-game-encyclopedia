In this      gripping story, you truly are your own worst enemy, as depression and      anxiety are harsh truths that many people grapple with every day. This      game seeks to shine a light on one such individual, where every day is an      internal battle: You. Your innermost thoughts turn against you, berate,      and seek to tear you down at every turn, as you simply try and live your      life the best that you can. The sheer weight of such a life will feel      overbearing as you desperately try and keep your head above water.\r\n </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T06:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b1c8a99c8180ef1ea68fe0a0e450db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhantomGuyGaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
