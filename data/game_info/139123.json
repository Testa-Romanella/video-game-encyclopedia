The goal is to obtain the gem at the end of each level. The game contains 10 towers each with 10 levels. You also receive within the game a tower/level editor to make your own to play and share with your friends. Before saving your level within the editor, play the stage you've just made first to make sure it's playable and you can reach the end level gem.
