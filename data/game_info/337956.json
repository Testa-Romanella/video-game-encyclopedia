May be broken or just not fun at all.</em><br/></p>On Blackwatch\r\n<p>Your duty is to keep an invasive alien organism from escaping its containment area. Protect the four nearby bunkers from being overgrown and destroyed.<br/>\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arrow keys</strong>: Forward, Reverse, and Turning.</li>\n<li><strong>Space</strong>: Fire guns.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>P</strong>:\u00a0Toggle\u00a0pause.</li><li><strong>R</strong>: Reset to start screen.</li></ul>\r\nInstructions:\r\n<p>Destroy the alien growths with your guns or the incinerator grids.<br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The organism goes through regular cycles of growth and dormancy.</li>\n<li>If any tentacles reach the edge of the containment circle, they will begin to grow rapidly!<ul><li>You can push them back inside the circle to get them back under control.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Tentacles outside the circle may grow even during the dormant cycle.</li>\n<li>If any alien matter touches the bunkers, they will explode! (We don't know why this is. It seems like a real safety hazard.)</li><li>Shoot off tentacle growing tips to prevent growth temporarily.</li><li>Push alien bits into an incinerator, and the entire severed strand will be vaporized.</li><li>The incinerators turn on when the player moves over them, or during dormant cycles.</li><li>If you provoke the main body of the organism during a dormant cycle, it may become active prematurely.</li></ul>\n\r\nLocal Multiplayer:\r\n<p>There is very basic local multiplayer support: Other players can press their \"fire\" button to join. Right now the only option is for two other players on the keyboard. I'll see about adding in gamepads.</p>\r\nOther Player Controls:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Player 2: WASD and Left Shift.</li>\n<li>Player 3: Numpad 8, 5, 4, and 6, and Num 0.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T04:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d84899382ef40c091922cb9d401384.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rossgrams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
