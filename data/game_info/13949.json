{"id": 13949, "slug": "airmech", "name": "AirMech", "name_original": "AirMech", "description": "<strong>AirMech\u00ae Strike</strong> is a fast paced Action-RTS game that can be played online competitively or cooperatively. Earn Kudos and Experience in battle and unlock a wide collection of AirMechs and Units while you practice the perfect strategy to emerge victorious!<br/><br/>AirMech has recently undergone a huge overhaul to prepare the game to leave Early Access. This includes a new 3D lobby, new Matchmaking and Ranking system, and a return of Custom games and a Lobby browser. This version is actively replacing many of the old systems of the game, so we appreciate your patience while we finish this significant improvement. We believe that upgrading AirMech to Strike is a better approach than making AirMech 2, since it keeps all your current progress.<br/><br/>Some of the systems we have experimented with during Early Access which do not fit Strike's PvP focus are coming to AirMech Wastelands, a companion game which does not contain any PvP. Look for that coming soon!Key Features:<ul><li><strong>Action-RTS Transformed:</strong> DotA-style gameplay with transforming robots each with their own unique stats and abilities. Fast paced action and shorter game lengths keep the battle intense!<br/></li><li><strong>Customize Your Army:</strong> Choose your AirMech and your Units to take into battle and help your team claim victory. Also unlock custom Variant AirMechs (skins) to have a unique look ingame.<br/></li><li><strong>Control Options:</strong> Supports both mouse/keyboard and Xbox 360 gamepad. Controls can also be completely customized for personal preference.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:27:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/71368ff253871f4453a8aa90f86ed262.jpg", "website": "http://airmech.com", "rating": 2.92, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 1071, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 37, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 101, "ratings_count": 87, "suggestions_count": 576, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 87, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carbon", "Carbon Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Carbon Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
