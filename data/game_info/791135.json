It's not the most substantial upgrade, but I do hope that the changes I did make have improved the experience that was there before. <br/></p><p>A Pick-Me-Up-Story is a text-based game inspired by my many escapades in picking up litter off the sidewalk and wondering what brought those things there in the first place. It's a game where the story is what you make it out to be, with a light moral - if you can call it that - at the end to wrap things together. It's a simple, very humble project, but the original is one of my favorite games that I've made, and I wanted to see if I could do anything else particularly compelling with the project. Please, do enjoy. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T15:05:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb0/bb0316b903836882fef9ed42dff23599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ToasterStrooder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
