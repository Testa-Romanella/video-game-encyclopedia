The inhabitants didn't pay attention to climate change although they saw the effects of it everyday. The people were not willing to change their lifestyles and the planet was dying. Their scientists found a solution and decided to pump the waste and dangerous substances from the atmosphere deep into the rock bed of the planet.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Years passed and all was fine until earthquakes started to rattle the world more and more. The waste in the ground had reacted with the rock bed causing it to dissolve and the planets crust crumbled into the sea. Only a few\u00a0 plateaus remains of the once beautiful planet.\u00a0</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Go through the portal on each stage to complete the mission.</p>\n<p>Use the WASD keys to steer your tank.
