Your job is to save this important patient from Bactio-C, the world's deadliest stomach bacteria. You do not know who this patient is, but you know she is important for something...</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p><p>The gameplay is reminiscent of the classic\u00a0<em>Space Invaders</em>. Some new mechanics/features include song selection, score keeping, muting music, and a story (with a killer twist ending)! This game was created as my first project for my Game Development class.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>I did everything for this game. Coding, animations,\u00a0 art (everything except the parts listed below), and audio effects. I give credit for the music to Poppy (the original artist) who's music I had to heavily edit to avoid copyright\u00a0laws. I did not create some backgrounds: the hospital, waiting room, and blood cell traveling came from adobe stock.\u00a0Poppy's hospital scenes came from her video titled \"I'm Poppy\". \u00a0The burning building is from the anime\u00a0<em>Kyousogiga</em>.\u00a0\u00a0I also used the Alien Invaders starter template from Stencyl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Note: The \"Die\" button is the exit button for a flash game. In the final screen it will take you back to the main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T05:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c8558b2fa4f12d82876f8d47f4d7560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["skaffenb"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
