The Boss is taken by Satan to Hell in order to marry Satan\u2019s daughter Jezebel. Saints lieutenants Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington follow them to rescue The Boss. You can play as one of the lieutenants.<br />\nThe game is set in an open world of New Hades, consisting of five islands, that you can explore flying around. This world is full of side quests, collectibles and other activities that you need to complete to progress through the story. While you can\u2019t customize your character, you obtain superpowers, including summoning demons to support you during the battle, magic aura to confuse enemies, and demon weapons. The core gameplay is third-person shooting but with a twist: instead of bullets your new guns will shoot with explosive toads and locust.<br />\nIn general, Gat Out of Hell follows the spirit of the franchise, supporting its fast pace and absurd tone that turns another mafia game in a colorful burlesque.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2015-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1ad/1ad3737af2c4a4ff8e7f5540b5dcade8.jpg", "website": "http://www.saintsrow.com/", "rating": 3.16, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 187, "owned": 2874, "beaten": 523, "toplay": 42, "dropped": 241, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 277, "ratings_count": 666, "suggestions_count": 630, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 673, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Deep Silver", "Volition", "High Voltage Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
