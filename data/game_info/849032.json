I don't have a programming background - all I've done previously is mess around with Unity. I started developing this project when I realized that Unity and its physics engine really spoiled me, and as a result, I approached every programming challenge in terms of Unity's physics engine... which is a very narrow and self-limiting way to program.\r\n</p>\n<p>Therefore I started looking for game engines that were the\u00a0<em>opposite</em>\u00a0of Unity. Because of how powerful (I think?) and broad Unity's tools are, I realized that Unity lent itself well to very big (and unfortunately, bloated) projects. I wanted something very barebones and limiting, so I settled on Pico-8. The restrictions surrounding Pico-8 (limited token, character, and sprite count) appealed to me as I wanted to quickly assemble a small project I could be proud of.\r\n</p>\n<p>I don't think I could have made a better decision in my journey to improve at game development and programming. Pico-8's restrictions made it necessary for me to teach myself things like object-oriented programming, writing clean code, and making arrays. I also appreciate that this project forced me to approach programming problems mathematically. Again, Unity and its physics engine really spoiled me.\r\n</p>\n<p>All that aside, there are definitely things I feel I could have done better. I wish I had documented my game development process better, and I'm certain there's a lot of stuff I could have written more efficiently. A lot of game mechanics I wanted to put in (i.e. power-ups, more enemy types, more waves of enemies) were cut out as a result.\r\n</p>\n<p>Overall this was a tremendously positive experience for me, and I hope you will have fun playing my game!\r\n</p>\n<p>ALSO: big thanks to Gruber! All tracks in this game were taken from \"Pico-8 Tunes Vol.2.\"\r\n</p>\r\nAdditional\u00a0Thanks To:\r\n<ul><li>Lazy Devs/Krystman for Pico-8 tutorials<br/>\n</li><li>Yu-Gi-Oh! I'm awful at creature design, so I based the enemy designs off some of my favorite Monsters from my childhood. Comment if you can figure out which ones they are!<br/>\n</li><li>My Mom.
