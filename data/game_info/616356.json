In it our hero, Lenny, must face off against hordes of emoticons brought to life, and their mysterious master, before they take over the world. Moon Eternal was the result of streamer Moonmoon's 3rd annual game jam, which took pace in late May 2021. The jam ran for 72 hours. This version of the game has additional levels of polish, bug fixes, QOL updates and new features!</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Disclaimer :\u00a0This game contains many jokes that reference Moonmoon's community and personality.
