I've been learning Unity, pixel art, programming, coding, you name it, all from scratch. DJ Adam's Interdimensional Mixtape 2019 is a prototype for a game I would love to eventually come back to and build upon exponentially when my skills get better.</em></p>\n<p><em>In it's current state, I (sort of) completed the prototype for the game jam Finally Finish Something 2019. I think it gets the basic ideas and feel of what I was going for. There's plenty of rough edges but I'm proud of this. I've learned SO MUCH from this project it's hard to believe one year ago I didn't know how to do any of this.</em></p>\n<p>Thanks to Patrick Pena for helping me with the initial concept.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my wife for continuing to support me locking myself in front of a computer and staring at pixels and code for hours.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who gives this messy little game a shot.</p>\n<p>Music credits:\u00a0https://www.purple-planet.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2b/b2b4d22fa2ffb1ac55b5c2a8a99a525b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AesopB3EF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
