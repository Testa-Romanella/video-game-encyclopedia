Simple yet challenging.<br/>Fly your rocket-powered mutant tardigrade (or \"water bear\") through the cold radioactive vacuum of space. Extend the quantum entanglement beam and collide the end with an asteroid to capture it. If you manage to pilot the gyrating double pendulum of mutant bug and space rock through frictionless space and get the precious metal and mineral-filled asteroid into the grinder without grinding yourself, you will be rewarded handsomely with $$BILLIONS$$ and a spray of overburden. You can go slowly and methodically or just sling it from a distance. Every asteroid is a random combination of rotation and mass making each a different challenge. Getting frustrated? Just get a new asteroid - there is always another asteroid.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/069218b9d8e8350445796aa4df522964.jpg", "website": "http://www.haulasteroid.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Real Maxwell"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Real Maxwell"], "esrb_rating": null}
