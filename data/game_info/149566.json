The catch is, you only have control over the survival parameters; how much food is made, how much damage is taken, how fast the agents\u00a0mutate etc. Go too easy on them and they won't evolve, go too hard and the lineage will end.</p>\n<p>HOW TO TRACK SUCCESS<br/>Your agents will begin by acting very strangely, doing things that make no sense at all.\u00a0You can track success in two ways;\u00a0by observing the way their\u00a0behaviour changes and you can also\u00a0click on an agent to bring it into the inspector which will tell you what generation your agent is.\u00a0Ideally you want a high number - this means that you have put enough stress on the population for them to evolve without dying out.</p>\n<p>THE AGENTS<br/>The simulation contains two different kinds of agent; Squares and Tadpoles. Both kinds have different survival requirements. Squares generate food for the Tadpoles and in turn they\u00a0feed on the Tadpoles (effectively robbing them of food). As an agent is filled up they become green, as they get hungry (over time or by coming into contact with squares) they become red. When they starve they die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>THE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISM<br/>When an agent dies, if there is an agent of the same kind that is healthy (green) the healthiest agent spawns a new agent and\u00a0passes on their genes to them (with some minor variations) and so each kind is \"naturally selected\" to behave in a way that makes them more likely to be healthy. And because agents are replaced as they die population is controlled.</p>\n<p>FERTILE GROUND<br/>In order to keep the world centred there is only fertile ground at the centre of the game scene, so departure from this area is death.</p>\n<p>THE GENETIC MECHANISM<br/>What makes this project different is that it is a driven by self-writing conditional objects. By that I mean that each agent carries with it 6 conditional objects\u00a0each containing a condition in\u00a0the form</p><p><em>if A is between B and\u00a0C then move D amount\u00a0relative to position E</em></p>\n<p>Each condition informs the movement of that agent. At first each condition is randomly assigned numbers from within the game and randomly generated numbers each holding a position in the condition. When conditions are passed down, these conditionals maintain their variable assignment positions (if A was distance to nearest tadpole it will remain so)\u00a0plus or minus a small random increment. Occasionally mutations will occur where 1 out of the 6\u00a0conditions is re-randomized while the rest of the conditions persist. In the event that no agent of a kind is healthy (green) then new spawned agents are completely randomly assigned as new.</p>\n<p>THE GAME<br/>The intended \"Game\" will involve tweaking the knobs to evolve highly capable agents that are able to\u00a0navigate mazes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f9203fb50b31c6d50879e9a3f8e71b41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nonzerosum"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
