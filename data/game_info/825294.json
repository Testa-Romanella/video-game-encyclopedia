Rolling it will cause the number on top to change. Make sure that the number on top matches one of the numbers of the green button.</p>\n<p>On your adventure you will be faced by many obstacles and objects that make it harder to get the die to the green button, but can also help you manipulate the number of the die, if you play it smart.<br/>Press R to restart the level and press Escape to quit or access the Level Select.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and let us know what you think!\u00a0<br/></p><p>There is a nasty bug where the die sometimes stops moving. Restarting the level should make it movable again. We are sorry this was left in the game!<br/></p>\n<p>Made by Tanoshee Games and Mish. We are cousins. Tanoshee joined last year's GMTK Game Jam.
