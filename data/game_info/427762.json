Be careful though as sick people everywhere are coughing. The more unruly patients have also been hiding toilet paper around the hospital. Collect 5 toilet paper rolls on each floor to unlock the next one, avoid getting coughed on and make it to the helipad on the roof of the hospital. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen your health gets low, wash your hands at the sinks on each floor.
