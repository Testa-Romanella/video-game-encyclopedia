{"id": 405924, "slug": "prudent-movement", "name": "Prudent Movement", "name_original": "Prudent Movement", "description": "<p>Prudent Movement is a mouse dexterity game. It is designed to be used with a mouse(I don't suggest using a track pad). Pick up the missing piece of the goal and connect them before the timer runs out. Careful movement and speed are required. Good luck.</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 8 Bits to Infinity Shape Jam II: Art Edition (WEEK ONE). Which has participants creating a game using only simple shapes in week one. Then others can pick up the game and add art, new levels, etc. for week 2.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to use this as an opportunity to introduce those that may not be familiar with Construct 3 to the engine. While Construct 3 is a payed service (around $8 a month) there is a free version that limits functionality so you can try it before you buy. I have done everything I could to make a complete game experience with the limited events and I have recorded a video to walk anyone through using the file. So even if you don't care about the jam feel free to download the project file and make something of your own from it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:47:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a5/0a5637b13f1a5695ca82e7c9ca39c681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vimlark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
