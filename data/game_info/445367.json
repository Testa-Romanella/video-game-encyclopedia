Play as one of two roommates with a shared history\u00a0who are on their own journeys to figure out who they are and what they want, and help them find the answers they seek.</p>\n<p>The visual novel serves as a continuation of the comic of the same name (which you can read here.) Although it's not necessary to read it, as the game works as a standalone piece of interactive fiction, it can provide some background information and additional context to the events in the visual novel. <br/><br/>Development began in the tail end of 2014 and continued until early 2016, where I took an extended hiatus for health reasons, but now things are back on track with a new build coming out each month! If you'd like to help support the project, consider becoming one of my patrons on Patreon and getting access to builds two weeks before the public, along with a number of other available perks!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T05:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fab53937fbd87e5e3ebb7b4b3f9440bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Kho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
