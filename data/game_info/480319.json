The demo can be played by 1-3 players (local co-op) and requires gamepad(s)/controller(s).<br/></p>\r\nEarly Horde Mode Contest at Sweden Game Conference 2019\r\n<p>The game features rich, colorful aesthetics with hand drawn environments and characters, a multi level story mode as well as a ton of challenges for those looking to really put their skills to the test.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nStory\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>The game is about a gang of teen mercenaries and their spacedog-captain \u00a0who stumble into an alien invasion and must fight against all odds to save the local bird-people from destruction!</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alien invaders start kidnapping people from the planet. Our heroes get caught in the middle and have no choice but to help the peaceful bird people inhabiting the planet, or they might just be out of work...\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><strong>Choose between three playable characters, where each of them has</strong>\u00a0<strong>their own unique set of abilities and specific role to play in the party. Combine your skills, work together as a team and fight your way forward, overcoming any and all obstacles!</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>In Story Mode</strong>, unfold the story of what the alien invaders want and do your best to stop people from getting taken from their homes. You can explore for meteorite shards, upgrades you can use in any game mode to modify your character and their abilities. You\u2019ll face enemies, bosses, challenges, events and maybe even a few puzzles!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Horde Mode Arena</strong>\u00a0lets your team work on communication skills, timing and go for the high score as an onslaught of enemies try to take you and your team down!\u00a0The longer you play, the harder it will get.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Completing daily challenges and events will give you access to unlockable content, time limited upgrades and much more.\u00a0</strong>The game also offers a wide variety of bonus challenges that grants access to rare and legendary meteorites (upgrades) for those skilled enough.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCharacters\r\n<p><strong>The game features</strong>\u00a0<strong>five main characters living on the ship: Super Nova, Dark Matter, Max Sparkles, Mercury and Captain Bowie. Three of which</strong>\u00a0<strong>are playable characters with the rest to be added after</strong>\u00a0<strong>launch.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Super Nova (the Tank)\u00a0</strong>is a powerful close range character who really knows how to take a beating. She\u2019s the first line of defense for the rest of the team and usually the first to engage enemies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Matter (the Striker)</strong>\u00a0on the other hand is what\u2019s referred to as a \u201cglass canon\u201d. He\u2019s an incredibly mobile and powerful damage dealer who will easily lay waste to anything in seconds - but if he doesn\u2019t keep moving, a few well placed hits is all it takes to knock him down. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The ever happy go lucky Max Sparkles (the Healer)</strong>\u00a0is rarely seen without his guardian spirit,\u00a0<em>Aumakua,</em>\u00a0at his side. Together they do their best to make sure their friends are always safe and sound by using spirit magic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nThe Bad Guys: General Poi and her pet monster Froggy!\r\n<p><strong>At the end of each level you\u2019ll face off against powerful generals and their various pets in the form of intense boss fights.</strong>\u00a0We've designed our enemies to force to you do more than just hack and slash your way forward. You'll need to read situations, learn enemy behaviors and timing - and know when to strike and when to run!</p>\n\r\nOnline &amp; Local Multiplayer\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p>The game features\u00a0<strong>both local and online multiplayer\u00a0</strong>but can also be played as a\u00a0<strong>single player game with AI-companions you can switch between on the fly!</strong></p>\n\n\r\nUpgrade Systems\r\n<p><strong>Exploring for and finding Meteorite Shards allow you to upgrade your characters and their attacks.</strong>\u00a0Meteorites are persistent between games and level up as you play, allowing you to build your own collection of upgrades and customize the characters to your specific play style and needs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nWant to run faster, do more damage, electrocute enemies on critical hits - or perhaps turn that defensive ability into an offensive one? Meteorites are the way to go!<br/><br/>\r\n\u00a0Challenges\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adding unique in-game challenges to your gameplay changes the rules of the game, adding replay value as well as unlocking super rare meteorite upgrades.</strong>\u00a0Challenges can be anything from a shared health pool between the three characters to enemies resurrecting after 10 seconds forcing you to rush through the levels. We\u2019ll add as many as we (and you, our community) can come up with!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\r\nRelease Plans\r\n<p><strong>The game has been in development for just over 3 years and we\u2019re pushing hard to have the game available on Steam Early Access in spring 2021.</strong>\u00a0At that point we want the game to be mostly feature complete with the remaining work being focused on adding more levels, characters, upgrades and challenges - and improving features and gameplay further.\u00a0</p>\n<br/>\r\nHow far along is the game?\r\n<p><strong>Everything you see in the trailer is actual gameplay footage from the latest build of the game, so</strong>\u00a0<strong>the game is currently very much playable and has already</strong>\u00a0<strong>been shown at expos in different stages for the last year or so. We\u2019re currently gearing up for a closed Beta in the coming months.</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much of the focus so far has been on making sure the game is fun, engaging and super tight which has meant a lot of hard work, gameplay testing, re-thinking and killing the right darlings to get things like combat mechanics, character abilities, interesting combos and animations super solid!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nOur very first technical prototype that sparked the idea for Go Fight Fantastic!\r\n<br/>\r\nWhy Early Access?\r\n<p><strong>As a small team, it\u2019s important for us to get the game out to the public as soon as possible in order to get feedback on gameplay, level design and to solidify technical aspects of the game such as multiplayer matchmaking and difficulty curve presets.\u00a0</strong>This will ensure we avoid common pitfalls such as producing a ton of levels and objectives without ever testing them in the wild.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Our vision of the Early Access release is to deliver a game which is as close to feature complete as possible with as few bugs as possible and to add content such as levels, more playable characters, etc along the way. We'll embed a development/release timeline straight into the game making sure you know what\u2019s coming and when!<br/></p>\n\r\n\u00a0The Team\u00a0\u00a0\r\n<strong>We are Lina (30) and Johan (37), a</strong>\u00a0<strong>nerdy couple from Sweden who are super passionate about games, creativity and tech. Together we run a two person production company/studio which allow us to realize our wildest creative dreams. We have been fortunate enough to be able to work together for the last 8 years, recently with the addition of our puppy/morale booster Bowie (who\u2019s in the game as Captain Bowie) \ud83d\ude09</strong>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<p>Pretty much since we first met, we'd been talking about some day taking the leap from interactive works and visual production to making console/PC games - and in 2016 we finally decided to take the plunge and start working on our absolute dream project full time, which you\u2019re currently reading about. It\u2019s not long now until we can finally, with your help, share it with the world!<br/></p>\n<p><em>If you want to see more of our previous work, visit our studio website:\u00a0</em><em>https://studio.gofightfantastic.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n\u00a0Where can I find out more?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Check out our Steam Page</strong>\u00a0and add the game to your wishlist to get a notification as we approach our release date.
