It\u2019s a great engine and already prefer it to Game Maker 2, which I used to use. However, I still had to learn many things during this Ludum Dare, which would now make me significantly more productive. I originally wanted to have branching dialogs, but I ended with such a mess of a spaghetti code, that I was unable to debug and fix it in a reasonable time, so I had to decide for one-side dialogs only. Maybe next time!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Known issues:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes the dialog abruptly ends when you skip the last text of the dialog by pressing Space.</li></ul>\r\nTools used.\r\n<ul><li>If you want to open the game, you just need Godot 3.4.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Sounds made with BFXR;</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Voices made in FL Studio using VST Speek 3.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Most of the visual assets were created in Inkscape, all of them are in .svg files.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In some cases, Aseprite was used, projects are in their .ase files.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/381/381ee31de9bd1d9d43e8a8085be96078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dzejpi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
