Mix and blend colors together in this calm and relaxing experience.<br/>The name \"Polychromia\" comes from the greek words \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd (many/much) + \u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1 (color), meaning \"with many colors\".<br/><br/>For a level to be completed, you must fill the whole board with colors and connect the hollow circles with the same colored lines. Overlap lines to blend their colors together and create new ones.</p>\n<p>Originally created for the \"A game by its cover\" 2021 game jam.<br/>Loosely based on the fictional famicase art \"NEOCHROME\" by Dan Ingman<br/>http://famicase.com/21/softs/076.html</p>\n<p>As this is not only my first game jam but my first game that I've created overall, it was an amazing experience. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T08:46:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b80c090bd01dd8a21254a10308b8041b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["JohnyNeverWalked"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
