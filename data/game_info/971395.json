To catch the fishes he enchants them by playing his banjo. Hit the numerical buttons on the keyboard following the beat to score (and to collect his diner).<h3>ORIGINAL CONCEPT</h3><br/>A fishing game or a rhythm game? Why not both?<h3>RETRO VISUALS</h3><br/>Pixel art animations and environments give the game an unique feel for this genre.<h3>BEAUTIFUL SONGS</h3><br/>Amazing songs composed by Peritune. All inspired by classic Japanese melodies with instruments like the Shamisen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T15:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/6438027fb0cbaf2d35c3b964ae884038.jpg", "website": "https://www.indigoware.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IndigoWare"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndigoWare"], "esrb_rating": null}
