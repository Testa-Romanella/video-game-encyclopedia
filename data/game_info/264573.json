You've heard very loud screams and found out that this place is haunted by \"<strong>The Reck</strong>\"... He can hear your<strong> heartbeat</strong> and everything you do, so be<strong> very careful</strong>! The <strong>only way</strong> to leave this place is to climb up a ladder which is located in the Hall. The main Hall door is blocked with big heavy rocks!<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you stay alive and complete all Bunker puzzles to leave this place as soon as possible?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Your main thing to do is to find a trap door key but as far as i know it's inside the Safe which is locked with code... To get this code you'll need to find a key that's leading to Statue Room where you can put 3 symbols and open the big vault door there you must cut one wire (be careful you can trigger the alarm if you get it wrong) but before cutting you'll need to activate power with secret code which is written on a paper and hidden somewhere. Finally big metal door will open and there you can find your Safe code...\u00a0<strong>BE CAREFUL HE CAN BE BEHIND YOU ANYTIME!!!</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Controls:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Q\u00a0</strong>- Hide your Lantern.
