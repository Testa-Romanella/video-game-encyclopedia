In this pretty depressing future, many things are gray and you are required to use single-use disposable fuel canisters that are made of bad materials, and eventually raise pollution (you have to trust us on this).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game was made for the GJL Game Parade 2021 Jam, with the theme One Use.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Aurora Wager, Sea of Thieves.</p>\n<p>Made by Feliks (Game Dev Graduate) and Adam (Physics student) for his first game jam and first experience using Unity.</p>\n<strong>Guide is contained inside of the game</strong>\n<p><strong>Double press escape to unfocus from cockpit in WebGL</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p> \u00a0If you prefer reading it in a more world-buildy way.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W, A, S, D - move around.</li><li>Mouse - look.</li><li>Left mouse - Interact, place item, pick up item.</li><li>Right mouse - throw the 20kg or 45kg thing you're holding.</li><li>Shift - sprint.</li><li>Scroll- zoom.</li><li>Hold escape for five seconds to show restart button.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>When focused on steering wheel:<ul><li>shift + ctrl to control throttle.</li><li>a + d to steer.</li><li>esc to stop focusing.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Grab a fuel canister\u00a0(or a few) as fuel runs out quick and no one bothers using integrated fuel tanks because of shipping and process change costs, and put it in the slot in the back of the thermal airship, then click on the steering wheel.</p>\n<p>To the right of the steering wheel you will see two buttons - the top one increases the temperature, and the bottom one decreases it. Try to get your balloon to a reasonable temperature (around 90C) and let it take off.</p>\n<p>But wait! Before you go! Probably go to the job board and enter the gig economy by starting a job. Place the boxes onto your airship and bring them to the next hub, which has a helpful indicator \"HDG-&gt;TGT\" which tells you what heading you should be.</p>\n<p>Complete about five deliveries for the full consequences of the climate change to take place.
