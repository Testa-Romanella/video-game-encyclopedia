Set your nav for the asteroid fields and your phasers to kill! Your goal is to blast your opponents into space rubble. Astervoid 2000 doesn't feature any power-ups, so it all comes down to your piloting skill. Explosive, indestructible, and projectile-ricocheting icy asteroids will slam against your ship, or can be weaponized against or by your opponents. Show them who's best!</p>\n<p><strong><em>(Perfect support for gamepads as well as keyboard and mouse.)<br/><br/></em></strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credits:</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Design/Art/Development:</strong> Justin Luk<br/>\n<strong>Music/Sound Effects/Development:</strong> Chuck Bergeron<br/><strong>Additional Music:</strong> memorecks<br/><strong>Artwork: </strong>Sven Ruthner, Lachlan Cartland<br/><strong>Promotional Artwork:</strong> Lyndsay Wasko<br/><strong>Big thanks to:</strong> Frank Meijer, our friends &amp; family<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Feedback/Issues/Questions:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\thttps://madcapacity.itch.io/astervoid-2000/communi...<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWebsite: \r\n\thttp://www.astervoid2000.com<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTwitter: \r\n\t@madcapacity &amp; @chuckbergeron</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a346733e4695890bf734b566d63bf206.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["madcapacity", "Chuck Bergeron"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
