Hire more, build more and make more to become an industry leading big shot. You're the boss! And the boss of the bosses! At least until you meet THE BIG BOSS...<br/><br/>\u2022 MANAGE \u2013 Hire &amp; train your workers. Not productive enough? Replace them with robots!<br/>\u2022 EXPAND \u2013 Run multiple factories at the same time, upgrade and make more crazy products<br/>\u2022 IDLE \u2013 Too lazy to boss around? Understandable. Automate! Profit!<br/>\u2022 ACHIEVE \u2013 Make THE BIG BOSS happy and get rewards<br/>\u2022 COLLECT \u2013 Get all the 200+ workers, bonus jobs, trophies...<br/>\u2022 PRESTIGE \u2013 Level up and restart with better workers, better bonuses, better everything<br/>\u2022 MONEY \u2013 Make more cash and tap tap tap to be a billionnaire multifactory tycoon<br/><br/>You have never seen factories like these before. Each one managed by a wacky boss such as the circus clown or medieval king who motivate their hard working employees by pounding the table and yelling. Just like your boss. Or your parents. Or spouse. We call this \"maximising profits through positive motivation\".<br/><br/>And the workers? There's a long queue of eager employees at the factory gates waiting to be employed by you! As their boss you get to train them and reward the best performers with prices like golden medals and the much sought after Employee of the Day award!<br/><br/>Oh, and did we mention the surprise boxes and loot? Boost productivity by giving your factory bosses a cup of coffee or an energy drink. That really gets them going! How about some motivational 80's disco music? Your employees will dance and jam and make even more while at it!<br/><br/>Become the biggest boss and MAKE MORE!<br/><br/><br/>!!WARNING!! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!
