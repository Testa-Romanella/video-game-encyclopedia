We are hoping for a full release with\u00a0these issues fixed and also plan on adding sound effects! We also have plans for\u00a0UI changes and potentially a story mode).<br/></p>\n\n<p>The Pharaoh has come to town, and like any upstanding citizen of Ancient Egypt, you want nothing more than to have an audience with them! In the game of Ma\u2019at, you call upon the power of the Gods to defeat your opponent and emerge victorious. By choosing your cards with care, and with a little bit of divine intervention, you may just emerge victorious!</p>\n\n<p>Pharaoh's Tournament is a demo of a\u00a0strategy card game based around the classic Egyptian pantheon. Choosing one of three types of God cards, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, players compete in a mythological game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The catch? The cards are both mark your choice in the round,\u00a0<em>and</em> act as your life total. Losing a round means losing a God, so play carefully, lest you lose one of your choices in the endgame. Each of the three types of Gods additionally come with type-specific actions, which can turn the tables on your opponent. With a little skill, no amount of bad luck is insurmountable!</p>\n\n<p>Killian\u00a0Menne -- Narrative design, mechanical design, playtesting, janitor.</p>\n<p>Ethan\u00a0Michaels -- Sfx/Music, systems design, playtesting, comedic relief.</p>\n<p>Ely Rossman -- Programming, systems design, wawawewa, moral support.</p>\n<p>Kristopher Yu -- Art, UI, visual direction, bad puns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:22:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/044f4bb87bb20f4ffe0ee568c4263df7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kugit", "Kristopher Yu", "QuickKiwi", "RegrettiSpaghetti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
