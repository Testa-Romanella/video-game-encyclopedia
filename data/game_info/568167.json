Time to settle and make yourself at home. There is\r\nfood enough to survive and thrive. Soon others join you and bring\r\nwith them skills that improve your capabilities. Working\r\ntogether you can shape the land around you. Protect your flock of\r\nsheep and help them to thrive too. Strength lies in differences and\r\ntogether you can make this slice of land a real nice place to exist.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Important information</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I had to strip out lots\r\nof stuff in an attempt to get it finished. Some of it was quite\r\nimportant. Having had a chance to look at it, post jam, the prompts I\r\nhad planned would have been really helpful, especially the first one.\r\nYou need to make a home before the rest of the jobs your people can\r\ndo become available to you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The first thing you\r\nneed to do is find a block of grass which has no rocks or trees\r\nsurrounding it. Level that and then build a house on it. Everything\r\nelse then falls into place after that.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Inspiration</p>\n<p>I loved playing The Settlers on the Amiga with my mate Tom as a kid. It's impact on me has never deminished. It's influence is here for sure. Also Minecraft and not just permission to use blocks. It's the crap water behaviour. The water is so bad! I attempted to fix that and now I know why they left it as it was. It was really hard to get it to behave. But behave it does. Take that Mojang!<br/></p>\n\n<p>The World</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The world is made of a\r\n64x64 grid of blocks. Each block has a type: Sand, Grass and Rock.\r\nDepending on the type of block and its current state different jobs\r\nbecome available to you in the task menu. Sand and Rock can have a\r\npile of Rocks to collect. Grass has Rocks and Trees. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each world is\r\nprocedurally generated. Sometimes that creates a very under sea level\r\nworld that is not worth playing, just quit them and build a new one.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The Weather</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It can be sunny or\r\nraining. When it rains all of the blocks get saturated. When the\r\nblocks run out of capacity to absorb the water then it over flows and\r\ncreates rivers and pools. The running water erodes the land and it\r\nstarts to shift the landscape. All blocks can have water on them. You\r\ncan collect water from any block that has it. The Sheep hate getting\r\nwet, but the people don't mind it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The sunshine dries the\r\nworld out. It also promotes growth. The grass and trees will grow in\r\nthe day if it is sunny. Standing water kills the trees and grass\r\nslowly over time, control where the water flows to optimise the\r\nworlds productivity. A block with no saturation at all also stops and\r\ngrowth so water is need, just not too much.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This is the element\r\nthat took the most time to perfect and I am most proud of.\r\nIntroducing the people took the attention away from this process but\r\nas the development was happening I really enjoyed learning how the\r\nwater flowed on any given seed. Have a watch if the bugs start to\r\nruin the experience, its probably the best bit of what I managed to\r\ncomplete. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The Sheep</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Sheep eat the grass\r\nand get nice and plump. Fat sheep when they find each other produce\r\nLambs. You can eat them if you can catch them. They will avoid water\r\nif possible but sometimes they get lost to the flood. Rescue stranded\r\nsheep and put them somewhere save and abundant. Oh by the way\r\ncatching the sheep is not as straight forward as it sounds they like\r\npeople even less than they like water and will actively avoid you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Trees</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Harvest Sticks, Apples\r\nand Wood from Trees. Apples only appear on established Trees, which\r\nyou can eat or use to plant new Trees. Harvest from the Trees that\r\nget waterlogged as they will have a harder time being productive.\r\nPlace them on higher ground. </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>New Arrivals</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>New People bring with\r\nthem new knowledge. I had to cut lots of this to get it done which\r\nhas made the impact of a new arrival a bit too subtle. They bring\r\nwith them the knowledge of new tools which extent the range of jobs\r\nyou can undertake. An Axe allows you to fell Trees, Picks allow you\r\nto cut Stone etc. I intended to make these tools craft-able but ran\r\nout of time so the game just acts like the people have done that\r\nalready. It has made this change a bit invisible. Work together to\r\nshape the land. They don't die and the hunger and thirst sytems have\r\nbroken in the final push so there really is nothing to worry about\r\nwith them. Also they wont go out at night unless you give them a\r\nspecific job to do.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The Houses</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Upgrade your Home to\r\nmake it more durable and resistant to flooding, well that was the\r\nplan. It does not work like that yet, but you do need a Home to go to\r\nand keep your stuff.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Bugs</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>I have 99 problems and\r\nthey are all called bugs. Some stuff does not work properly and this\r\ngame really shows how little time I was able to do tests after\r\nimplementing new elements of the game loop. You will have to be\r\ngentle with me, but hopefully you can see the potential. I will do a\r\npost jam fix. Mostly because I am looking forward to playing it once\r\nits done. Enjoy it for what it is. I had fun making it. This is a\r\nsolo entry and probably represents 100 hours work over 7 days. It was\r\nbrutal.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Peace TheSoulSelector</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f7e9e2866184600913bcc48d9f2bc88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSoulSelector"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
