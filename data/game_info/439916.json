There is a new game, called Space Royale, where <strong>100</strong> spaceships fight each other in an asteroids field. Only one can win, and there is glory only for him.</p>\n<p>This game was made for #dreamarcadearchive game jam (2020).</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You control a spaceship and the object of the game is to shoot and destroy the other spaceships. <strong>One hit</strong> and a spaceship is <strong>destroyed</strong>, even yours.</p>\n<p>It's a multi-directional shooter arcade game characterized by an old-style graphic and sound, mixed with a <strong>single-player battle royale</strong> component.</p>\n<p>Like in a classic battle royale game, there is a safe zone that gets smaller over time, and if you touch the <strong>safe-zone limits</strong> you die. Your goal is to remain the only one alive.<br/></p>\n<p>You can <strong>upgrade your weapon</strong> by destroying enemy spaceships (the upgrade can be higher shoot rate or higher bullets fired simultaneously).</p>\n<p>You can play safely, trying to avoid any combat, or you can play aggressively, trying to kill more spaceships as you can. It's up to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: don't be afraid of <strong>colliding</strong> with other spaceships or asteroids, <strong>it won't damage you</strong>.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD/ARROWS: move<br/>Mouse: aim</strong></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Made with <strong>Godot</strong> 3.2</p>\n<p><strong>Font:</strong> Edit Undo Line BRK<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> 8bit on the offensive V2 - by Ted Kerr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a43a4efc252f60706f2c16092ef2d11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["rudyvic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
