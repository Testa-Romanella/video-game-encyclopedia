This is a small and easy\u00a0stuffing game, that is made by a request. It does not have any complicated gaming mechanics or anything. It is interactive feeding (mostly) and gaining simulator. You can see new interfaces in this game navigation and so on, hope you like the progress, next I will update my Full of Work game. Here you can \"train\" 3 girls for football team, you can not lose or win, hust the process. So do not tell me I did not warn you)</p>\n<p>Warning! Read this before you buy!\r\n</p>\n<p>If you follow me, you should know, that for now I create multiple short games with some sort of game mechanics in almost standard interface. It is literally a bunch of images, that appear in different circumstances and there is almost no weight gain. All my games are stuffing games. And for me the main value is that they are different. Different models, morphs, clothes, different style of interactions. Every game is an experiment. They are as they are. Some people, such as me like such things and diversity. So if you are not into it, i ask you to understand and to forgive))\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T10:47:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb997b86952ca787d71147a8ab0450a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Yuliya3k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
