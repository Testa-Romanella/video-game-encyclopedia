Theme of the jam was covid-19. This is the game I created for it. I really wanted a top down shooter, so this was my approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It really needs some balancing but it's in playable form. I had a lot to add but simply didn't have time.\u00a0 Any feedback would be very appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:27:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc716a5bfe92f276a021e5e7d8353134.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kaganatalay"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
