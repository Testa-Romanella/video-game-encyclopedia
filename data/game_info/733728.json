Expect glitches. It would be a great help if you could point out these glitches in the comments, too! Especially if they're weird.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Font -\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/users/dibujado/</p>\n<p>Sound Effects -\u00a0https://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sfMaker/</p>\n<p>Pixelation filter -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/pixe...</p>\n<p>Music made by me using Bosca Ceoil, Models also made by me using Blender.
