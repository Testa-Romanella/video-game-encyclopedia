Populous II was remade and remastered for the Nintendo DS in 2008. Populous II is a direct sequel to Bullfrog's earlier game Populous and is one of the company's most notable games.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, Populous II is a god game, where the player is guiding his people in battle against the followers of an enemy god. Whereas Populous only generally alluded to undefined deities, Populous II is specifically set under the backdrop of Greek mythology. The player is a demigod, one of Zeus's countless children with mortal women, and has to battle one Greek deity at a time until finally facing his father. Zeus has promised to let the player into the Pantheon on Olympus if he can survive all the battles.</p>\n<p>A data disk was also released for Populous II, titled Populous II: The Challenge Games. This was set in Japanese mythology instead of Greek, and had each level as its individual challenge, slightly in the style of a puzzle game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:47:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ce/3ced0117c169d68787fcc8c7dd46f604.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "Classic Macintosh", "PC", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Bullfrog Productions", "Bullfrog"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
