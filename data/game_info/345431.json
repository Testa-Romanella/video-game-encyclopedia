Shake your virtual hips to the ridiculously fun arcade action of Conga Master as everyone fights to make the longest conga line possible. No rhythm required \u2013 anyone can conga!<br />\nPlaying Conga Master couldn&#39;t be easier: guide your dancer across the floor, dancing round people to add them to your line as you go. Longer congas let you add people faster, but watch out for pigs stinking up your line! Play solo or, even better, drag three friends onto the dance floor for some local multiplayer conga madness and see who&#39;ll become the true Conga Master!<br />\nNo rhythm? No problem! With just two buttons, you too can become a Conga Master. Just move across the dance floor and convince other dancers to join your line... the longer, the better!<br />\n1-2 player(s)<br />\n1024KB Minimum<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
