It's been a bit of fun and I'm doing this because I have GM 1.4 and it seems easier to do in this than other engines, so why not....</p>\n<p>Anyway, the game is pretty a retro old school shooter, where you carry weapons, blast your way through enemies and take on the bosses to complete the levels. Like Doom style and is inspired by that old genre.</p>\n<p>After playing some Ion Fury a little, some Project Warlock\u00a0and Duke Nukem, I couldn't resist but to try and create something simple that could be a bit of fun. That's how this FPS has come to life and I'm keen to slowly build upon this and see what happens.</p>\n<p>Hope someone enjoys it and happy to hear any kind of feedback. Though it is very early prototype and more just concept for whether or not it'll be fun or if I'm wasting my time.</p>\n<p>Happy Veg out Crew :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T10:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/4821d4e834e07d8b07a05c961c72e71a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kimpo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
