Or, as you prefer to call yourself, a SPACE EXPLORER.<br/>Space is quite repetitive but has all these lovely little hidden surprises, like the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. You've been in space for almost THREE YEARS now, observing the rings of Saturn. You left behind some friends and family, but you have Skype. There are other people on your MAIN SHIP, but you can easily go days without seeing eachother, and they are neither friends nor enemies.<br/><br/>The issue is, things feel a bit different today. You've woken up with a new kind of energy.<br/>Something is telling you you need to make a change.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:49:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13edac8d09f277b73cca150184737d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["caracompass"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
