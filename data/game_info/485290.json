Click \"End Turn\" after your turn is finished.</p>\n<p>Each player can either move a piece or attack with a piece once per turn for 'free'. Player can use skills as desired. At the end of the turn, if one of your pieces moved forward, you will gain 1 AP.\u00a0\u00a0Players cannot have\u00a0more than 2 AP.<br/><br/>During your turn you can consume 1 AP for an additional action. However, a piece that has moved cannot move again. A piece that has attacked cannot attack again. To perform an additional action, just select the action as normal and you will be prompted to consume 1 AP.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>A piece starts with max SP, and all SP is used when that piece uses a skill. A player has to wait for their SP to recharge before using the skill again. At the end of the turn, every unit gains 1 SP if they are not at max.</p>\n<p>Pieces do 1 damage by default, except for Jaune, who does 2. When a unit's HP reaches 0, it is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Character Skills:\u00a0<br/><br/></strong>Renee - Can pull a unit from 2-3 spaces away towards her (horizontal/vertical).<br/></p>\n<p>Mika - Can push a unit next to her 2 spaces away (horizontal/vertical).</p>\n<p>Jaune - No active skill, but passively does 2 damage instead of 1.</p>\n<p>Feng - Can move through enemies for 1 turn.</p>\n<p>Julio - Can stun an enemy for 1 turn.</p>\n<p>Celina\u00a0 - Can attack either 1 space away or 3 spaces away (the latter is considered a ranged attack). Her skill is also a ranged attack, which additionally hits to the left and right of the targeted space. Celina cannot use a ranged attack if she has moved.</p>\n<p>Kai - Can do an attack that does 2 damage.</p>\n<p>Dia - Can sacrifice 1 HP in order to gain 1 AP at the end of the turn (in addition to regular AP gain). Can still be activated at 1 HP, thus destroying herself.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Right now this is a static game with hard-coded pieces, but the original concept was to have team-building and all sorts of fun combinations. There might be other strategic elements added and more opportunities for combo attacks. The system right now admittedly feels a bit restrictive, so it may be reworked.</p>\n<p>Just a tip, Mika and Renee have very powerful positional skills that can turn the battle in your favor! My friend used Mika to push Jaune towards my units in order to one-shot them. Eventually I plan to add more units for team customization and will rebalance everything accordingly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T02:50:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb6/eb600096d5de1e5bb0c4866b04b2a8d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fusionist"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
