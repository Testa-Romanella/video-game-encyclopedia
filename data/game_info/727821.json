To the left there is a shortcut that is meant to be taken on the second and third laps.</em>\n\n\n<em>Figure 3: Inside the Deku Tree.  There is a long turn spiraling up the trunk.  It is divided by ramps to add more opportunity for player input.</em>\n\n\n<em>Figure 4: The cave features turns that are sharp enough for drifting but can still be made using automatic turning.</em>\n\n\n\n<em>Figure 5: The ramp acts as a transition out of the cave.  Players can land in the water and reemerge up onto the land.</em>\n\n\n<em>Figure 6: The entrance to the Lost Woods section.  It features sharp turns that resemble the Lost Woods from Ocarina of Time, but are spaced out enough that the player has enough time to start their drift.</em>\n\n\n\n<em>Figure 7: The bridge at the end of the course is meant to resemble the exit bridge (from the Kokiri Forest) in Ocarina of Time.</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:45:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0e182edcc1568f484e1a3769ffa0b2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zoe Pilgrim"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
