I'd recommend somewhere between 6-10 people for the best playing experience.</p>\n<p>This game was made for #onegameamonth #1GAM April 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bd/1bda773fef5b08466591767986990e0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jess Gates"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
