Happy to join the event, and figure out something quite interesting.<br/>The game we made is called Gun &amp; Volleyball, and it came from the generator we wrote to seek for ideas, when the key words: Lora + Volleyball showed up, we found our inspiration.<br/>In Gun &amp; Volleyball, two players instead of use hand to hit, should use gun to shoot volleyball in order to hit the ball to the opponent's ground and win the point, that is how Lora Craft would do, right?<br/>As for the time limits, we didn't manage to write an AI so that even one player can enjoy the game. Instead, the game can only be played by two players locally(unless you wanna try play both sides at the same time), hope you can find someone to play with, sorry for that!<br/>Finally, we truly hope to have your feedbacks on our game, they are of much value for us, maybe with your help, one day we will make this game published.</p>\n<p>One Last thing: Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Control Tip:<br/>Player One: wasd-&gt;move and aim direction, G-&gt;fire, H-&gt;jump<br/>Player Two:arrows-&gt;move and aim directon, ,-&gt;fire, .-&gt;jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18ad19e8d7c47188fe06d4d8131ff749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DanteWang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
