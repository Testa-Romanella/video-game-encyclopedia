{"id": 915695, "slug": "crazzy-rummy", "name": "Crazzy Rummy", "name_original": "Crazzy Rummy", "description": "<p>General Game Rules:</p>\n<p>Crazy Rummy is a card game played with two 52 card decks. The object of the game is to dispose of all the cards in each round and get the lowest score totaled up from all rounds. The player who discards all of their cards wins each round. There are two ways to get rid of cards, discarding or playing on another players hand. When a player is in turn and they do not want the face up card, their required to draw before their turn can begin. A players turn ends when they discard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>RUN: A run consists of four or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order, such as 5,6,7,8 of hearts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BOOK: A book consists of three or more cards of the same kind, such as 4,4,4(not suited).\u00a0</p>\n<p>WILD: Wild cards consist of 2\u2019s or Jokers. Wild cards can replace two cards in a RUN. Example: 5,joker, 2, 8 of hearts. The 2(wild card) can be any suit. Wild cards can replace one card in a BOOK. Example: 4,4,joker or 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Rules:</p>\n<p>Lets use 4 players as an example. The dealer deals out the cards for the first round and flips up the first card. The dealer allows everyone to see the face up card and decides if they want it.\u00a0 Here are the options</p>\n<p>\u2022 Option 1: If the Dealer wants the card, then they take the card and do not have to discard. It becomes Player 2s turn. Player 2 draws the top card on the deck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Option 2: if the Dealer doesn\u2019t want the face up card, they will pass to Player 2. Player 2 is in turn and can decide if they want the card. If they want the card, then they will have to pick up the face card and discard a card they do not want. If they do not want the card, then follow option 3.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Option 3: If the Dealer and Player 2 do not want the face up card, then Player 3 gets the option. If Player 3 wants the card, they will have to grab a penalty card(first card on the top of the flipped down deck) and the face up card. If they select the card, then the next turn defaults back to player 2. If they do not want the card, then Player 4 gets a chance. Refer to option 4.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Option 4: After all players have been given an opportunity for the card, Player 4 gets to decide if they want the card. If they want the card then they take a penalty card and the face up card. If they do not want the card, they pass and the next turn starts with player 2. Player 2 takes the top card on the deck that is face down</p>\n<p>NOTE: This sequence is the same throughout the game. Every time a card is laid down face up, each player gets an option to grab it. It has to go in a clockwise motion following the sequence outlined in the options above.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a player holds the requirement for each round, and they\u2019re in turn, they can put their cards face up on the table. After they\u2019ve laid their cards on the table, Players are required to discard or play on someone else\u2019s face up hand. When a player is in turn, they can pull wild cards from opposing players face up hands. Example, an opposing players face up hand is 5,6,wild,8 of hearts.\u00a0 If a player is in turn and has the 7 of hearts, they can take their 7 of hearts and replace the wild on the opposing player\u2019s hand. This allows players to play off opposing players hands. Wilds cannot be touched on a BOOK.</p>\n<p>Rounds:</p>\n<p>Round One \u2013\u00a0 7 cards -2 books\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Two \u2013\u00a0 \u00a08 cards - 1 book and 1 run\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Three \u2013 9 cards - 2 runs\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Four \u2013\u00a0 \u00a010 cards -3 books\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Five \u2013\u00a0 \u00a0 11- cards -2 books and 1 run\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Six \u2013\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 12 cards - 2 runs and 1 book\u00a0</p>\n<p>Round Seven \u2013 13 cards - 3 runs</p>\n<p>Scoring System:</p>\n<p>Ace =\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 15pts and can be used as a high and low card in a run</p>\n<p>9 through King=\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010pts\u00a0</p>\n<p>3 through 8 =\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 pts\u00a0</p>\n<p>2's are wild cards =\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a020pts\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jokers are wild cards = 20pts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:50:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ed/9ed3fec8a25fc1b096f7f619bc46d5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["OBriensgaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
