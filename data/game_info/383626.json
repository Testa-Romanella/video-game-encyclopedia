Unfortunately, our country has seen better days: the hordes from the south are about to invade, our economy and morale are pretty low, and rumors spread of assassins in town. Make decisions that count, but be cautious. You never know when you&#39;ll die.<br />\nEach decision affects the story. Trade, raise the army of undead, make alliances or execute your loyal subjects. The choice is yours. The characters remember your doings and act accordingly.<br />\nManage resources. Balance your kingdom&#39;s Army, Food, Gold, Faith, Happiness, and Health. A wise king knows what&#39;s best.<br />\nSurvive. The game has dozens of endings - a chain of wrong decisions can lead to death. Maybe next try you&#39;ll live a little longer?<br />\nPlay minigames. Cut wood, mine for gold, trade on a market or win the princess in dice. Your skill can save your life.<br />\nHow will your story end?<br />\n=============================<br />\nKingSim is a game from a very small studio and is currently in development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T18:58:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c1f/c1faa488ba67f1cd97cd32cf182832f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 32, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 124, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fuzzy Pixel Game Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fuzzy Pixel Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
