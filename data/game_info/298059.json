Nowhere close!</p>\n<p>Is it fun? Not yet!</p>\n<p>I am building this game using Defold. I am hosting a dev log on the Defold forums if you wish to track the more detailed progress of the game. I highly suggest using Defold if you ever intend to make a 2D game and have little to no prior experience doing so. The community is incredibly involved and the game engine is well-documented.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This game is in <em>very</em> early development and I would love any suggestions on how to fix or improve different aspects of it. If you encounter bugs and such, go ahead and submit an issue on my Gitlab for the project, or simply comment on the game itself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4c4e6b9ee81c13087f0b37988871ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DangerFloof"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
