Use the virtual joypad to move around. Each step you take eliminates some ground. Rocks will fall if they have no ground supporting them, so be careful! Try to collect every treasure before the time runs out.<br/><br/>This game was made in a week as a gift to the original developer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40d7e4ffb835bc27411df12c0489f4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["George Owen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
