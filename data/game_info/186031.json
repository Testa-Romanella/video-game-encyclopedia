I'll do it soon. <br/><br/>Thanks for playing/reading </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1a/a1a6af56b09ebc416023f17acaada8e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gammel"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
