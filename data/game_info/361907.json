Since the agent is blind, he has to rely on information from 4 communication specialists, each with his own camera and set of info, but our agent can use ONLY ONE piece of that information at a time. So you'll either know where you are, where enemies are, where hostages are located or the layout of the office floor.</p>\n<p><strong>!!\u00a0May be a little laggy in web :( !!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>[1], [2], [3] and [4] to change camera view.</p>\n<p>Mouse to aim and left mouse button [LMB] to shoot.</p>\n\n<p>That's it, have fun ;)</p>\n\n<p>Framework: Godot 3.1<br/></p>\n<p>Text editor/IDE: Vim</p>\n<p>Art Tool:\u00a0Aseprite<br/></p>\n<p>Audio tool: Audacity</p>\n<p>Sounds: Freesound.org</p>\n<p>Music: Bensound.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8c/f8c07662ce9272557844b4eff9900878.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MonsieurPazur"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
