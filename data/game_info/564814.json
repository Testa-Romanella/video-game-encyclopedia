(Prototype)", "description": "<p>This is an early prototype for the old school eight bit alien abduction game I've always wanted to play. You use the keyboard or a controller to fly your saucer around the side-scrolling farmland trying to abduct cows to terraform a home planet. See, your species breathes methane and global warming is your friend. Win, win for us.</p>\n<p>This game is not finished but I haven't touched it in a few years and just wanted to put it out there. I\u00a0have a bunch of ideas (think Choplifter) and new artwork (updated cows, mothership, barns)\u00a0done but just no time to get it implemented.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So let me know what you think. Maybe I'll make time if anyone is into this kind of thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:20:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37f/37ffbd80e70192a0c49d15b03fb6bce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["JoskerDu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
