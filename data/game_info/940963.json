A few key features left unfinished, but overall mostly finished. Dive 5 floors and beat the lich while hopefully winning some loot in Kobold Fishing or Dwarven Mining.</p>\n<p>Unfinished: fog of war, final gambling game, trap rooms, furniture special action rooms, any balance, better combat UI, better UI in general<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs: sometimes a room can not have a door...this can be run ending sorry<br/></p>\n\n<p>Monsters do not drop loot, but instead have a chance to drop tokens which can then be gambled within 2 custom gambling games in the casino.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I know a core ask of the game jam was more procedural generation, but a goal of my for this project was to be able to make a physical board game of this game with little change needed. So for the map it's using a HeroQuest style main board and then picking room sizes from die rolls, type of rooms from more die rolls, and finally roomsub types from a final die roll. I did my best that it could all be converted to easily rolling 2 dice and looking at a table and putting the pieces down.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cb/3cb864a3257c271b331ca9a0cff6ccc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["demiskeleton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
