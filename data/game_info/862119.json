Throughout your journey, you will encounter many difficult trials and challenges.\u00a0\u00a0You have about 7 days before the island is entirely consumed, so you will need to manage your time and resources carefully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is actually a demo of an older game called Project Dragon.\u00a0 I wanted to redesign the entire game from the ground up, starting from this demo.
