Taking place at the inception of a micro universe, you play as a space whale, beings that are capable of bending the realm around them. Gently float through an empty world and watch it develop\u00a0around you then sit back and spend some quiet time to yourself as you gaze on your creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mikrosm is free on itch</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'd like to take the time to thank you for coming to check out this game. I'm very excited\u00a0to share this title with you, it represents many different things to me, but right now I have a hope that if this can bring some calm to your day, then I've succeeded.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is free to play and download on itch, and for the\u00a0cost of a drink, at a later date a\u00a0release on\u00a0Steam. If you found enjoyment from playing please let others know.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Currently in development</strong></p>\n<p>This is a project I am actively working on at the moment. I am releasing a prototype of what I have been working on, practicing a multitude of skills as part of my journey back into game development. Right now the focus is on realigning with Unity, coding and general game design elements to better understand myself in terms of skills and proficiencies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal for the next project will be turning turning my focus to asset production, story narrative and general game design elements. There is -so- much to learn when making games.\u00a0Until then, I hope you find some enjoyment out of Mikrosm.</p>\n<p>Officially this is a demo phase, but the prototype is an experience in of itself. Constructive feedback is very welcome, please leave a comment below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T09:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec5a3495d0b03c358a2b8c7fa284455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Assassiowl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
