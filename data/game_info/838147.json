They sent probes to set up base camps on the surface\u00a0and underground oceans to scout and prepare it for terraforming, but they all mysteriously disappeared\u00a0before establishing contact. Many people suspected that aliens were behind this. Thus, a new probe with\u00a0defensive measures was sent. It's called Robot Colony Model Z-001(R.C Z-001). It contained weaponized\u00a0defense bots and resource collecting collector bots. It survived long enough to establish a connection to\u00a0Earth. You are in a nearby support spaceship, you must assist in expanding the system using the nearby\u00a0resources and occasional airstrikes until the foreign threat can be automatically dealt with and then we\u00a0may proceed to Phase II.</p>\n<p>\u00a0AI Colony</p>\n\n\r\nHow to play\r\n\n<p>Eliminate threats with Defender Bots\r\n</p>\n<p>Collect resources with Collector Bots\r\n</p>\n<p>Upgrades and Power-Ups are available using the aforementioned resources\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8b/e8bd08cf25a5262747fdf25e34249723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Doorlock11"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
