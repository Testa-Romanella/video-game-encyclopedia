Do you prefer to make them slower at the worst possible turn? Leave a cactus and temporarily puncture their wheels. If your style is being the fastest one just use the turbo and gain advantage through the shortcuts.<br/></p>\n<p>If you think you can beat On Wagons' minions, try the Single Player and make them regret that you downloaded this game. Each time an On Wagons' minion loose, they loose more power. There are more than 700 to win, can you beat and find them all?</p>\n\n<p>Warning: The multiplayer is self-hosted by us.
