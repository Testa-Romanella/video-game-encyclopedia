The game takes place instead of\u00a0the events of Rondo of Blood or Dracula X. You will play as Richter Belmont and traverse Dracula's Castle, finding subweapons, health upgrades and maybe even a familiar along the way! Use Richter's powerful item crashes to destroy your enemies or rely on the trusty vampire killer whip!\u00a0This is Version 1.3 of the game and significant updates have been made. I'd love to see people make videos or give me constructive feedback. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:36:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/317e8b7384c40400158c5c3717ae26df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prezp00nage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
