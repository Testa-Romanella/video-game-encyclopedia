{"id": 288774, "slug": "space-rabbits-in-space", "name": "Space Rabbits in Space", "name_original": "Space Rabbits in Space", "description": "\"Space Rabbits in Space (and everywhere else)\" is a 2d parkour skill-based platform adventure about betrayal, speed, hard love, and fun facts. <br/>Played with one hand. <strong>On a mouse</strong>. Like we stated in the short description, it's good to have a free hand for various reasons.Ninja-rope and jetpacks includedDescription not needed. No DLC required.Online asynchronous multiplayerLike hot-seat, but dumber and not even similar.Replay systemWatch, study, be amazed &amp; curse while you watch the 10 best players (and you) racing through the levels. If that is too much to handle, you can probably lower the expectation and boost your self-esteem by switching that funky letters to filter players only from your country - or even better - to your friends.LeaderboardsAs in the replay system, you can filter the leaderboards to your country or friends only. Also, there is a leaderboard per level... and a global leaderboard that combines all gameplay modes.Input bufferingWe reward skill, so if you buffer your input (before you land), you will get additional speed and jump power. If you buffer your input again, you will get even more speed and jump power!No luck involvedEvery time you restart the level, things will be absolutely the same.<br/>Combine that with proper \"analog\" pathing and we have a skill-based race!Unbelievable storyLiterally.Dress to impressAcquired with in-game gold. That you get by playing the game. Gold that you can't buy. No microtransactions :/50-60 handcrafted levels... and more to come. As a free update. If we don't starve to death and change profession. In that case, no more levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa20045a4ac12678e7e304f104eaf166.jpg", "website": "https://ventilatorshark.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ventilator Shark"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["European Games Group"], "esrb_rating": null}
