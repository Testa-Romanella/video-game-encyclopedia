Shapeshift into the form of other people in order to kill everyone in the building. Arrow keys to move. Z is to shoot (but only police can shoot), X is to shapeshift into the nearest enemy, and to shapeshift them into you. Anyone who sees you shapeshift or shoot a gun will be alerted, but if you shapeshift into someone else, they'll think it was them. Kill everyone to win!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e7/7e7e5b34f7f0d0baebd8c500cd367f4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["FBJazz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
