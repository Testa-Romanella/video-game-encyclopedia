Scour the forest for the succulent umbrella shaped veggie, but look out! A ghost lives in the forest! (oh no) He'll getcha! And no one knows what he'll do with you once that happens. I imagine it's pretty bad. When have you ever been caught by a ghost and something\u00a0<em>good\u00a0</em>happened afterwards?</p>\n<p>But that's not all! Only\u00a0<em>having\u00a0</em>the mushrooms isn't enough! Once you have all of them, you gotta get out of there. Unless you want to stay in a haunted forest forever holding six mushrooms as you awkwardly avoiding the ghost that lives there.</p>\n<p>After finishing my game, I hope you'll have time to tweet me <em>your</em> best time here (maybe hit that follow button too &lt;3)</p>\n<p>If you want to support my games (so I can make bigger and better ones), consider hitting up my patreon\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>And\u00a0</em>feel free to join my discord server for a good, nay, a\u00a0<em>great</em> time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29c/29c7db6611bc5bbec9db6342e40aa8d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nomppie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
