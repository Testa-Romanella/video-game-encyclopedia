I am a solo and indie developer.\u00a0I'm still new in game development and my ambition is to become a game developer.\u00a0 I developed Air Force X game as my Final Year Project in Bachelor in Interactive Multimedia Design. Since that, I discovered that I have a strong passion in game development. I distributed Air Force X game for my relatives and close friends and got many positive reviews. So I decided to share Air Force X game online for public.</p><p>The purpose of this game is to promote awareness about hazardous chemicals all around us and the effect to our body</p>\n<p>Please try my game and any feedbacks or donations are highly appreciated.
