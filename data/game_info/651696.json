Lucky number I guess? idk.<br/>The theme was \"Rush\" and the Limitation was \"Tell a story with no text\", meaning the game should have NO LETTERS WHATSOEVER.<br/>Worked hard on the game even tho it's basically simple.<br/>Made with\u00a0Unreal\u00a0Engine 4.<br/>Hope you Enjoy the game &lt;3</p>\n<p>You're trapped in an Unknown Room for some reason.<br/>You have a Flashlight and some weird device with a battery in your inventory. <br/>You look behind you and you see a giant metal mysterious lookin door that is locked up tight.<br/>You venture around for a minute and you find yet another mysterious PC with glowing colors\u00a0turned on that is showing nothing but a single image.<br/>You immediately\u00a0figure out what's going on but right after you do a yet ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS red glowing floating lookin Robot starts to follow you with a loud banging noise that gives you the feeling that you should be avoiding this Robot at all cost.<br/>You start running for your life until you lost sight of the Robot, it stopped following you while you hide there at the corner of the Unknown\u00a0Room crying like a little kid that won't stop crying until it gets what it wants.<br/>As your sobbing uncontrollably, you find YET ANOTHER PC infront of you\u00a0but this time glowing a different color.<br/>You approach it, doing whatever your doing with the PC. You calmed down and have set your mind to escape this Hellhole.<br/>Each time you interact with the PC, your weird lookin device shows up an image similar to the one on the PC's screen with the numbers 0 and 3. You have to find 3 of them items scattered around your room before the battery goes empty\u00a0and return it back to the PC with the matching image on your weird device\u00a0for the PC to spit out a KEY. You need 3 keys to open the\u00a0giant metal mysterious lookin door to reach your escape.<br/>Good Luck! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T22:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86b/86bc9ce605991209e8dc3cf2c89ab4d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EdeeSigns"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
