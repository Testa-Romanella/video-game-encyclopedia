Since the beginning of the events of Alexio passed 4 years. It was planned to reveal the story more, through texts, dialogues, events and places. Alex will attend familiar locations that now look different. And even re-furnish your house. Raccoon brothers will regret it! I want to save and show various interesting materials in here, on Gamejolt, because they really are good! Stay tuned!\r\n</p>\n<p>a long way of development Alexio:\r\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This game was frozen in 2018. A programmer left the project. It is so sad, because a lot of graphic content and animations are ready, there is a good prototype. But it must be exported from GMS in the GMS 2. Someday I'll do this game! \r\nSomeday Alex will be saved from the hordes of enemies:\r\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can also playing in Alex the duck demo. Unfortunately, the file was somehow damaged and there are bugs in game, that were not there before. Troubles have happened with the project too!\u00a0Perhaps someday I will post a new version AtD, already on GMS 2, corrected, supplemented, in 60 fps<br/>PS: Alex will acquire new abilities!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390ca3a843c1e1f5739061eb7556cdd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duck Team"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
