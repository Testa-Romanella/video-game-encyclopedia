I hope this game is small but detailed. I really like the dynamic environment design in the game. When the rain comes, the battlefield will be wet by the rain. The sound of rain heard in the house is different from that outside the house. It is this kind of idea that leads me to design the dynamic environment in the game. I am very grateful for the feedback and bug report.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking a moment to read this, I really hope you enjoy this game.<br/><br/>\u4eff\u751f\u68a6</strong><br/><br/><strong><ul><li>The first/third person perspective can be switched at any time!<br/></li><li>Quick start in ten seconds, end in fifteen minutes.<br/></li><li>Two game modes, team fight and grenade fight.<br/></li><li>Three different styles of battlefield maps and customizable AI quantities(20, 30, 40).<br/></li><li>More than 6 weapons (including melee) will continue to increase.</li></ul></strong><br/><br/><strong><ul><li>Low Poly style game.<br/></li><li>Fast game rhythm, suitable for any time.<br/></li><li>Dynamic environment, including weather, sound effects.<br/></li><li>Easy to learn arcade game, smooth game operation experience, keyboard or keyboard + mouse, as you choose.<br/></li><li>Steam achievements support!<br/></li><li>Steam cloud support.<br/></li><li>Now available in Chinese, English, Russian, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Polish, Turkish and Japanese.</li></ul></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b24/b249569556ffae472e9e869fc19922ce.jpg", "website": "https://weibo.com/fangshengmeng", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u4eff\u751f\u68a6 Personal Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u4eff\u751f\u68a6 Personal Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
