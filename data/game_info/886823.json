On my part it was just a test of what I\u00a0could do in a short time with zero preparation.\u00a0</strong><br/><br/>I will come back and make the code for counting the targets more robust, at the moment it just\u00a0 operates on target collision and that is a bit flakey.\u00a0I'd like to see what happens when you get to level 5+ and what chaos it creates :)<br/><br/>It uses one free asset store sound but thats all, the rest is just Unity itself.<br/><br/>Its tempting to replace the prototype shapes with some real models, maybe later once the showreel is done.<br/><br/><strong>What would I\u00a0have done differently?</strong><br/>1. Lerp the target movement rather than a random translate jump at fixed time intervals<br/>2. Think of more interesting things to do than just shoot the targets<br/>3. Think more about the jams mutators<br/>4. Possibly start with just the cube and add an extra piece to it for each level you complete<br/>5. Allow for holding down the movement keys rather than a single click mapping to a single move (although that is less scuffed - see mutators)<br/><br/>Overall though I\u00a0was happy to be able to make something from scratch in about 3 hours the morning after a big family wedding.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T07:35:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55e/55eab28b34c5b655b1385347c1997df1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcusFromOz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
