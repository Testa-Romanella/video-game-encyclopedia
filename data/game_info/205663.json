I added sounds, and for the graphics, I used Kenney's pixel art platformer assets pack. I found the sound effects on\u00a0FreeSound.org and the music was borrowed from the complete audio example on the official Phaser website. Feel free to send feedback in any way possible; my only condition is that if you have criticism, only use constructive criticism, please. Please enjoy my first game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f36/f36c10883881d3dfa1c748d92e735708.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RailRunner16"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
