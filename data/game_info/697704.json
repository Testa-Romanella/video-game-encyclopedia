In other words, the normal customer service experience, really. You have 120 seconds to score as many points as possible.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is totally mouse-driven and has a lengthy in-game tutorial. There's also a readme included in the downloads.<br/></p>\n<p>If you encounter lag, stutter or other problems with the web build, <strong>please download and play a native build.</strong> They have a few more features too. Sorry and thank you! This version of Godot isn't so great at HTML export.</p><p>Also, this game has <strong>an online leaderboard </strong>courtesy of SilentWolf.<br/></p>\n\r\n[ BACKGROUND ]\r\n<p>This game was developed in about a week for the Palette Jam 2 [8 Bits to Infinity]. It uses 8 colours from the Rampy16 palette . The colours chosen are #252945, #515369, #848fa1, #515369, #bd46b7, #d4996a, #63b04f and #e06767.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"<strong>Break</strong>.\" This game offers you the unique chance to enjoy breakfast, or perhaps your lunch break, with the world-class solutioneers employed by <em>VirtuMegaDyne Amalgamated Businessworx</em>.</p>\n\r\n[ GAMEPLAY ]\r\n<p>This game is controlled with the mouse. You won't need your keyboard or a gamepad or anything. Well, you'll need the keyboard to enter your gamer tag, in \"Settings.\"</p>\n<p>There's an in-game tutorial, but here's the summary:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left-click on guests once they arrive at the counter. </li><li>Left click on either the FOOD or DRINK button, </li><li>then left click on the item you wish to hand over.</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally, left click on litter to collect it, and left click on the big screen with the speakers to change up the vibe.<br/></p>\n<p>As for the scoring: You get points for serving guests - far more if you're interpreting their requests correctly. You get points for collecting litter - the faster the better. And you get points for providing the correct\u00a0 V I B E\u00a0\u00a0 to the people waiting in line - this is only counted when the line moves.</p>\n<p>2000 and up is a *very* respectable score, 3000 is my personal best. If you can beat that, make sure to let <em>VirtuMegaDyne Amalgamated Businessworx</em> know.</p>\n\r\n[ CREDITS ]\r\n<p>All development work by futur_null.
