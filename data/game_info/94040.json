{"id": 94040, "slug": "massive-chalice-itch", "name": "MASSIVE CHALICE (itch)", "name_original": "MASSIVE CHALICE (itch)", "description": "<p>MASSIVE CHALICE is a tactical strategy game set on an epic timeline from Double Fine Productions. As the Immortal Ruler of the Nation, you'll take command of its heroes, forge marriages to strengthen your Bloodlines, and battle a mysterious enemy known as the Cadence in a war lasting hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>Key Features</p>\n<ul><li>Bloodline Genetics - MASSIVE CHALICE features an innovative Bloodline system that allows the player to marry heroes together to produce children. The Bloodline system uses a randomized genetic code for every hero. Their children can end up with the best (or worst!) gameplay-impacting traits of their parents. </li><li>Permadeath - The heroes in MASSIVE CHALICE age over the course of the timeline and eventually pass away. This forces the player to engage in the beauty of permadeath and always juggle an imperfect party of heroes with which to do battle! </li><li>Bloodline Relics - If a hero has fought valiantly enough when they inevitably pass away, their weapon has a chance to become a Bloodline Relic. This powerful Relic can be passed down to any character of the same house in order to carry on the legacy of the fallen hero! </li><li>Long View Strategy - Because the war lasts 300 years, players need to take a long view of their strategy. Decisions have to be made dozens of years in advance and long-term planning is incredibly important. That 3-year-old toddler is going to grow up to be your most reliable melee fighter sooner than you think!</li></ul>\n<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p>Windows Minimum</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows Vista</li><li>Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPU</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 3000 Graphics</li><li>DirectX: Version 11</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>\n<p>Windows Recommended</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Windows 7</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHz</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 4000 Graphics</li><li>DirectX: Version 11</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>\n<p>macOS Minimum</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or later</li><li>Processor: Intel Core Duo</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: ATI HD 2600 / NVIDIA 8800GT / Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAM</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li></ul>\n<p>macOS Recommended</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or later</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i series processor</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: ATI HD 4670 / Nvidia 285 or better with at least 512 MB VRAM</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li></ul>\n<p>Ubuntu</p>\n<ul><li>OS: Ubuntu 13.04 LTS, fully updated</li><li>Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPU</li><li>Memory: 4 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon HD 2000, or Intel HD 4000 Graphics</li><li>Storage: 2 GB available space</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b14/b14215e7e17006be83b5f073534f8f50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
