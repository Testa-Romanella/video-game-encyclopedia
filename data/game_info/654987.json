See how many you can block!</p>\n\n<p>\"Virus Hack\" is my first solo-made game, created by following along with Dr. Sky Anderson's YouTube class: 10 Steps To Make Your Fist Game. Using Gamemaker Studio 2, the code is almost entirely Dr. Sky's. However, all of the assets are created by me! I also used FL Studio to make the music, but the song is my own chiptune arrangement of the Digimon Theme Song. While the game is rudimentary, it's published as a testament to my progress as a game developer.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06f/06f60cff3a95676e0273037f4f24bf95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scrump"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
