It's a tower defense-style game where you build platforms and turrets, then try to defend yourself from enemy ships, helicopters, and subs.<br/></p>\n<p>Playable, but a lot of SFX are not implemented, and there's no in-game instruction to speak of. <br/></p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>: During the building phase, click and drag components to place them. Recommend building at least one of each type of turret, since each type is used against a specific enemy type. After you're done building, click the arrow to proceed to the action phase. \"Z\" fires your SAMs, \"X\" fires your anti-ship gun, and \"C\" fires your depth charges. They all behave a bit differently, so pay attention!</p>\n<p>Concept/coding by me. Art by Jaclyn, Toby, Cooper, and me.
