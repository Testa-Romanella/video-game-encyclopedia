They cannot treat their damaged skin, so it\u2019s our job to help them! Click an item to pick it up, then click an injury to heal it. This heals this and this heals this. For wounds, you get skin, click the mesher, and click the wound. There is a time limit in each round. In that time, you must heal this many injuries. Thank you, and good luck!</p>\r\nSoundtrack\r\n<p>This game\u2019s soundtrack is available on Bandcamp.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd92e00c3df2871c1bdd577300b860dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Burgerian Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
