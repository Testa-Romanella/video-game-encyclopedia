It is done by creating a backing narrative in which the protagonists (three blood cells) must help the player get through their day by visiting the different organs and completing a minigame for each one.</p>\n<p>This game intends to complement a more traditional method of teaching with its gamification and varied mechanics. Blood Trip also includes\u00a0inclusive features, such as an adaptive difficulty system and adaptability options for people with dyslexia. The game can be played in\u00a0English or Catalan.</p>\n<p>As for now, there are only three different organs the player can explore, even though the design for the final game includes at least five.\u00a0 Once the demo is completed, the player is presented with a final mark, which is based upon their performance along the playthrough.</p>\n<p>This game was made for a university project in a span of three months; two dedicated to the design and one to the development.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>TEAM:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Roger Gibert Rovira</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0<strong>Oriol Viu Duran</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ONLY PLAYABLE ON WINDOWS</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:38:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e3/8e38a96aed2f221a9f5fe2ef4290def0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IROnia", "North Oriole Games", "Roger Gibert Rovira"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
