{"id": 7147, "slug": "lyne", "name": "LYNE", "name_original": "LYNE", "description": "<p>LYNE is a minimalist puzzle game where the player has to connect geometric figures. Connect blocks (these can be square or triangle) to other blocks of their respective color to pass the level. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The goal is to connect the same colored shapes with non-intersecting lines. Depending on the difficulty of the level, there is a bigger network on which to do this, and more color sets to connect. It is a fairly straightforward title, but what makes it replayable is execution quality and unusual puzzle-solving experience. There are no timers, no enemies to kill, and no penalties for making mistakes. The puzzles are simple in the beginning but as time passes they become more complex. In a while, the player faces more colors, shapes, geometrical figures, lines. Lyne has several pre-made puzzles (650+), so it does not run out of levels too soon. Also, the game also offers daily challenges; they&#39;re called procedurally-generated puzzles. It also supports multiple languages. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The game mechanics are easy to follow. The player might get stuck on a puzzle, but every one of them can be solved.<br />\nThe interface, in general, is smooth. The sound effects are string together in a pleasingly melodic fashion; they are soothing and quiet. The graphics and the music are designed to calm the player; the colors are soft and pastel.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T17:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df47a9df698c2c5b40de17e80f2f5ae0.jpeg", "website": "http://www.lynegame.com", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 31, "owned": 1063, "beaten": 33, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 50, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 115, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 115, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Thomas Bowker"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Thomas Bowker"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
