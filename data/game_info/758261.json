He sent us some audio, graphics (the invaders and other characters are scans of his resin creations)\u00a0, and some videos.</p>\n<p>Setting:</p>\n<p>T-Nu is sitting at his computer about to play some video games.\u00a0\u00a0Daddy is looking over his shoulder. You control the player using the arrow keys and the space bar shoots.</p>\n<p>The game itself\u00a0 IS playable, but its more about the 'back-and-forth\" between father and son. It's worth \"beating the game\" and also losing, to hear the dialog.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you haven't heard of T-Nu or his channel, PLEASE check it out, its great!</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkoIXAz16GztHi1kbGzm6Cw</p>\n<p>The game is about 30 MB. Game length is about 5 minutes.\u00a0 Installs into the Program Files folder. Tosses a desktop shortcut on the desktop.\u00a0Comes with an uninstaller.<br/></p>\n<p>Because it is a \"new\"\u00a0file, (not downloaded often)\u00a0Windows and/or your browser may freak out a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>*pew pew pew*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T13:10:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/228eb92a3617d507944fc11d513a770a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Volttherobot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
