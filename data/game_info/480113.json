Two cats, Boxy and Moxy, are set to clean up this mess. Using their combined powers, you will traverse 60 levels over three areas in order to destroy all skulls and restore the beauty sleep to the people of the old Kingdom!</em><br/></p>\n<p>Developed by Antonio Savona (of P0 Snake and Planet Golf fame), designed by Lobo and with a soundtrack by Aldo Chiummo, <strong>Boxymoxy</strong> is a fiendish (or felineish?) puzzle game for the Commodore 64 unlike anything else you have ever played. Inspired by Lobo's cat Gelsomina, with a little Sokoban and a tiny dash of Angry Birds thrown in for flavour, <strong>Boxymoxy</strong> is a game about moving cats and smashing skulls using the power of logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Boxymoxy</strong>\u00a0is guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours in the purr-suit of that perfect or even under-par score! Simply put, it's the cat's whiskers!</p>\n<ul><li>60 challenging puzzles set across three different areas!</li><li>Unique gameplay! Purr-fect puzzle action!</li><li>Player performance-graded progress system with on-cartridge saving!</li><li>15 digitally-sampled and distinct meows from 12 cats!</li><li>PAL/NTSC compatibility!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Save Children's lives</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Defend their rights and help them fulfil their potential, from early childhood through adolescence. <strong>Boxymoxy is a Charity project. The game is free to download, but every donation will go to UNICEF.</strong></p>\n<p>Your objective in <strong>Boxymoxy </strong>is to destroy all the skulls on each level by moving and switching between the two cats (Boxy and Moxy). When you set the cats in motion they continue moving in a straight line until they hit an obstruction or wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In game, press 'FIRE' on the joystick in port 2 to switch between Boxy and Moxy, and push in a direction to move the currently selected cat. Hold down 'FIRE' for a second or so to open the pop up options menu, allowing you to select music or sfx, restart, quit or resume the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Moxy</strong>, the blue cat, can destroy skulls but will stop when colliding with Boxy or walls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boxy</strong>, the pink cat, cannot destroy skulls but serves as an additional 'moveable wall' for Moxy. Boxy will help you manoeuvre Moxy into areas he cannot reach on his own.</p>\n<p>Each level has a target number of moves in which you should aim to complete the puzzle in. You can complete a level using more moves, but you will not achieve the maximum number of stars... and stars unlock future levels!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Note that <strong>Boxymoxy </strong>was programmed to run exclusively from cartridge, as it continuously streams data from the ROM during play. For this reason, a D64/Disk version is not available. Instead, a downloadable .CRT is available in both GMOD2 and EasyFlash format to use via emulation or on real hardware devices such as the Ultimate 1541-II. Please check that your hardware is compatible with these formats!</p>\n<p><strong>Buy Boxymoxy on Cartridge for your Commodore 64 Computer!</strong></p>\n<p>Enjoyed <strong>Boxymoxy</strong> on your modern-day PC?
