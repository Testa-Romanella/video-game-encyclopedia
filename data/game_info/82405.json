Store your stats and equipment in the easy to use and convenient layout. We've even included dice, a handy Combat screen and buttons to test all your abilities as you play. Navigation is easy using left and right swipes on each screen.<br/><br/>__________<br/><br/><br/>Alice's Setup Screen<br/><br/>Unlike some adventure gamebooks, in Alice\u2019s Nightmare in Wonderland Alice\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are not determined randomly. Instead, you get to decide what she is good at and, conversely, what she might not be so good at.<br/><br/>Alice\u2019s Insanity score always starts at zero. Her Endurance score always starts at 20.<br/><br/>Alice\u2019s remaining attributes \u2013 Agility, Logic and Combat \u2013 start at a base level of 6. You then have a pool of 10 extra points to share out between Agility, Logic, Combat and Endurance as you see fit, but you can only add up to 5 points to each attribute. So the maximum starting score for Agility, Logic, and Combat is 11, and the maximum starting score for Endurance is 25. (You must apportion all 10 points one way or another, and cannot leave any unused.) <br/><br/>When you have spent all 10 points, click on the Cheshire Cat's smile which will appear, as if by magic!<br/><br/>__________<br/><br/><br/>Adventure Sheet<br/><br/>Alice has five attributes you will need to keep track of during the course of the adventure, using Alice\u2019s Adventure Sheet. Some of these will change frequently, some less so, but it is important that you keep an accurate record of the current level for all of them.<br/><br/>All five attributes can be adjusted from this screen using the left and right arrows. Although there are limits on how high each of Alice\u2019s<br/>attributes can be at the start of the adventure, there is no limit as to how high any of Alice\u2019s attributes can be raised during the course of the adventure, dependent upon bonus points Alice may be awarded. However, should Alice\u2019s Endurance score ever drop to zero, or below, then her adventure is over and you should stop reading immediately; if you want to tackle the quest again, you will have to start from the beginning, determining Alice\u2019s attributes anew, and then starting the story from section 1 once more.<br/><br/>At various times during the adventure, you will be asked to test one or other of Alice\u2019s attributes. In each case, a convenient button has been created to carry out each test automatically \u2013 rolling the appropriate dice and checking whether you have passed or failed the test.<br/><br/>In addition to the test buttons, on some occasions during your adventure you may be asked to roll one or two dice. Swiping up on the Adventure Sheet screen will do just that. Take the dice on the left for a single die roll, or the ones on the right for two dice.<br/><br/>Navigation<br/>Swipe left to return to the Main Menu. Swipe right to go to the Equipment Screen. <br/><br/>__________<br/><br/><br/>Equipment Screen<br/><br/>On this screen you can store a list of all the items you pick up during your adventure. In the boxes provided you can record up to 20 items, store notes and your current paragraph number when you have to take a break from the adventure.<br/><br/>Navigation<br/>Swipe left to return to the Main Menu. Swipe right to go to the Adventure Sheet. <br/><br/>__________<br/><br/><br/>Combat Screen<br/><br/>On this screen you can enter the stats for up to three monsters to battle against. Clicking on the battle button will make combat rolls for any active monsters (ie. those with an Endurance score higher than 0). As the battle progresses you can adjust the Monster's Endurance as required by the battle rules, along with your own. Don't forget to manually add the additional Combat point for any initiative gained during battles.<br/><br/>Navigation<br/>Swipe left to return to the Main Menu.
