Catch Marc Chagall flying in the sky with his muse Bella. Virtual reality has fully developed in his art style and is available on Oculus glasses. <br/><br/>To fully immerse yourself in the picture of the artist, the scene uses movement along three axes (you can go up and down as if you are floating in the air). Therefore, we strongly ask you to start the scene while sitting.<br/><br/>Made for:<br/><strong>Oculus Quest 2</strong><br/>Created by:<br/><strong>Volha Kurakova</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b876eee0a26fa87e77b4e3f47c20d890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["game.utb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
