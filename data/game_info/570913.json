Inspired by Noita's spell system.</p>\n<p>This game didn't go quite as well as i had hoped. I severely underestimated how long a week was, so i programmed things as if it was a 48 hour jam, resulting in horrendous code. Because of that i couldn't really fix the bugs or add the QoL changes i wanted to, and that's not to mention the game design issues. But at least i got something done.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e9/5e954c890b6fc0783650ed322da34047.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mia Bentzen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
