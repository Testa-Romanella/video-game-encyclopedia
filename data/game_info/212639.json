Don't let yourself and your land be colonized. You need to PROTECT THE LAND! <br/><br/>Shoot with your weapon against the enemies that are advancing towards you in this colonization-inspired space invaders style game. </p><p>* This is the first game I made using GMS. This game's difficulty is highly unbalanced and the menu uses too many buttons... sorry for that, I'm uploading it the way it was made for miniLD69 (theme: colonization)</p><p>Btw, I left a debug feature on. You can press \"P\" to skip stages, so, if you find the game too difficult, skip some stages to see the other worlds :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d12/d12e26f5eb90b894668302884483f724.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Siridakis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
