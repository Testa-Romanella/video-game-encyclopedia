Watch how the combination of neural networks and an evolutionary algorithm can enable your creatures to learn and improve at their given tasks all on their own.<br/><br/>The tasks include running, jumping and climbing. Can you design the ultimate creature that is good at all of the tasks?<br/><br/>The latest update allows you to easily share your simulation saves and creature designs with your friends.<br/><br/>Note that this is more of a simulation than a game. There are no real objectives. But there is a lot to learn if you are interested in the basics of machine learning and neural networks. You can even look at the source code if you want.<br/><br/>There is also a Mac &amp; PC version available for download and a browser version for you to try out on the main project website (keiwan.itch.io/evolution).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T03:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4eda8c9a391443aaa8f9c26e8c112d_o10APaM.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Keiwan Donyagard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Keiwan Donyagard"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
