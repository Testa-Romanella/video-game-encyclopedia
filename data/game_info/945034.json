And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess. <br/><br/>You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will be the end of the world.<br/><br/>She will do everything in her power to stop you. She'll charm, and she'll lie, and she'll promise you the world, and if you let her, she'll kill you a dozen times over. You can't let that happen. Don't forget, the fate of the world rests on your shoulders.<br/><br/>You're not going to listen to him, are you?
