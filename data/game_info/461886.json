I am super excited to publish my first finished game, and I hope that everyone can enjoy it! Also, this game was made in about a week for the Beginner's Circle Game Jam of 2020 (Thank you to the organizers for making all of this possible!). Finally, I greatly appreciate any helpful game development/programming/art tips within the comments, as I eagerly look forward to getting better and better at making games.</p>\n<p>Once again, thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3b/b3b3e3055bfd2ee983caeeca3bf0c4b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["rynxJW"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
