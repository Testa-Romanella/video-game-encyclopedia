If a guard gets too close, you lose. Unlabelled rooms: RECEPTION (glass front, little holes, carpet floor, key is on the wooden barrier.)</p>\n<p>LOBBY: (this is the area with the pillars.)</p>\n<p>This is my second game, so expect a lot of bugs and irritating gameplay. Its complete-able though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>PRESS E to interact with objects. We were in a rush to complete this simple level near the end, so theres no sound, and no indication of items you need to pickup. However, these items are present and you just need to press \"E\" near them to activate them.</p>\n<p><strong>P.S Doors are temperamental\u00a0- just keep trying...</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you dont enjoy the game, Thank you for giving it a try.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:47:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb22b3ebe49c3da6d73789bdb8c9c5d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tbage", "DeepSleeper"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
