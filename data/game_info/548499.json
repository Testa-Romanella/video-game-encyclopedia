Deep in the night, de player has entered the building but discoveres that navigating in the pure dark is harder than expected. The large cookieshop has surveillance cameras everywhere, so navigation is going to be key. Watch at your map where cameras are and make sure you hack the normal cameras and take distance from the heat cameras!</p>\n<p>For the\u00a0JameGam\u00a0this is my first ever game / project / gamejam using UE4! I made all the game logic myself using blueprints (yes i know its inefficient but this was actually quite easy to learn) and drew all the game art myself as well. It was an insanely fun experience and if you have any tips for me (e.g. the size of the game is huge, navigating with your mouse is buggy and I've been struggeling with screen resolutions) I am eager to learn! Also, I never let anyone playtest this game, so probably it's unbeatable. But hey, it's about learning! Cheers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T05:53:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/7189493eca305a3643d98986f2e3e549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smetvrees"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
