This project was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2019 and is my second ever game jam. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>left mouse - shoot\u00a0 (hold down for longer distance)</p>\n<p>right mouse - recall bullet</p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>Enemies spawn on the red cubes around the arena.\u00a0Your objective is to\u00a0 defeat all the enemies in each wave and try and beat your high score. However your points decrease over time and running out of points is a game over,\u00a0so you have to be quick to build up your multiplier and gain enough points to counter the loss. You also have to watch out for risk\u00a0 which increases when you have the bullet and decreases when you don't. If your risk maxes out\u00a0 or gets to 0 you lose health so keep that in mind as well.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bad/bade45fdf3bd35a43a45fc24d7330e6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ikoms"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
