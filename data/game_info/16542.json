I created the first scene - the canyon - as I wanted to demonstrate the effect to friends without having to guide them through a game to a suitable point. It was so effective I wanted to expand on it. This is very much aimed at being an experience you can keep in your library and bring out to show new users - it isn't a game so there aren't any challenges in it, and will have less effect on veteran VR users.<br/><br/>The current stationary scenes are:<br/><ul><li>A wooden bridge over a canyon<br/></li><li>A narrow ledge on a cliff<br/></li><li>The top of a building in a city<br/></li><li>Being in a dark passageway with only a flip lighter<br/></li><li>Being trapped underground with the walls closing in<br/></li><li>In the ocean surrounded by sharks<br/></li><li>On a window cleaning gondola on the side of a skyscraper</li></ul><br/>There are also scenes which include player movement:<br/><ul><li>Performing a base jump<br/></li><li>Swinging round a city with grappling hooks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:10:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97d/97dcb2ca5bfcb55264c10568ae0e80da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fulby Technologies"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fulby Technologies"], "esrb_rating": null}
