Put out trash fires (literal ones), fix jammed printers, reset the server, bring people their caffeine fixes, deliver those crucial useless trinkets from Amazon the staff keeps ordering and fix those toilet clogs... All in a day's work...</p>\n<p>Get through the 300 second day in one piece and get rewarded with a nice pat on the back and a high score. You got this!</p>\n<p>## How do I play?</p>\n<p>- Rough Day supports keyboard and gamepad input:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Left stick/WASD Movement</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - East Button/E key to interact</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - South Button/Space bar to jump</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Right stick/mouse to move the camera</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Left Trigger/Shift to sprint</p>\n<p>- Move around the office and deal with incidents. Some incidents require items (package deliveries and coffee for example).</p>\n<p>- Deal with each crisis before it's too late. Miss five events and your day will end early. Get through the 300 second day and you shall be rewarded.</p>\n<p>- The mini-map shows you nearby incidents:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Green are active incidents to deal with</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Blue is a recently resolved issue</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Red is a missed incident</p>\n<p>- Music can be disabled/enabled or turned up/down from the options menu (available from the pause menu as well). It originates from the Juke Box in the lobby.</p>\n<p>## The team and the work:</p>\n<p>While we used a number of assets in this project, putting it together in the timeframe was (as always with LD!) a challenge. Let us know if you encounter bugs of course!\u00a0 While extended development might not be likely on this project, we definitely had a ton of further ideas to make the game better (more engaging, longer, more funny, etc...) but we'd also love to hear your ideas!</p>\n<p>We have opted out of the Audio category as the music and the sound fx are provided by third parties and other than the technical rigging of these, there was not much effort involved. The graphics on the other hand involved a significant amount of work despite assets being used for the 3d models (as credited below) (Design, lighting, rigging).</p>\n<p>## Assets/Tools Used</p>\n<p>[Unity 2021.3.10f](https://unity.com/)</p>\n<p>[Polygon Office by Synty](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/polygon-office-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-159492)</p>\n<p>[Polygon Icon Pack by Synty](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/gui/polygon-icons-pack-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-202117)</p>\n<p>[Big Action Music Bundle by Muz Station Productions](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/rock/big-music-bundle-action-rock-energy-65132)</p>\n<p>[Ultimate Sound FX Bundle by Sidearm Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/ultimate-sound-fx-bundle-151756)</p>\n<p>[Polygon Particle FX by Synty](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/polygon-particle-fx-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-168372)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T16:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/143/14353d0a32f8e4bbcbd9b9a2e0deb9a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BackslashOllie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
