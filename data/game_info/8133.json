If it sounds good to you, chances are you&#39;ll love it.&quot;  3/4 - SlideToPlay.com<br />\n&quot;This Christmas edition of the game is great for veterans of the original, who want more Super Mega Worm goodness, and the tweaked gameplay and hilarious new Christmas theme will please them.&quot; 4/5 - ThePortableGamer.com<br />\n&quot;Super Mega Worm vs. Santa brings all that fun to the North Pole, where penguins and elves become your prey. It&#39;s more amusing to decimate the forces of Christmas than it is rednecks and soldiers, so this festive edition to the game definitely scores brownie points for that.&quot;  7/10 - Destructoid.com</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Follow Us<br />\nTwitter:<br />\nhttp://twitter.com/deceasedpixel<br />\nFacebook:<br />\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Deceased-Pixel/126012137446122</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:45:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/cca09f9198b2fe6d967e8a10adc00445.jpg", "website": "http://deceasedpixel.com/supermegaworm-vs-santa", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Deceased Pixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Deceased Pixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
