Select a hole to hide in with left/right and then press A or Start to confirm (Z or Enter on keyboards). Afterwards you'll see if the dragon was safe or not.</p>\n<p>The game is entirely luck based! So don't worry too much about winning or losing. I made this to test out different parts of the GB Studio engine as a sort of warm-up, ha ha.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T15:11:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36d/36d8069b3fba4081bacf8e9b5c6ee052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["robotstubble"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
