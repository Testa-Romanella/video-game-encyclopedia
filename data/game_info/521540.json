Your only hope of rescue is to reach the radio tower at the top. Make use of the magnetic terrain to scale cliffs no human could normally climb.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This game isn't super polished so if you fall off the path you may be best to just restart. Sorry.<br/><br/>Created over the span of 72 hours for the UVGD 2020 Game Jam. The theme was just \"platformer.\" Admittedly there really isn't much platforming in this, but oh well. Inspiration probably doesn't need to be said. Despite that inspiration the path is actually very linear, but that was bound to happen given the allotted time. I'm still happy with how it turned out.<br/><br/>----Credits----<br/></p>\n<p>Credit to Minions Art for the triplanar terrain shader: https://www.patreon.com/posts/quick-game-art-16714688<br/>Credit to Roystan for the water shader: https://roystan.net/articles/toon-water.html<br/>Public domain sounds gotten from Freesound.org</p>\n<p>The rest is created by me :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T07:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/991/99121aa3a910e4db5ab16826f4dabdfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tsunscreen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
