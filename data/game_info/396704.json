All audio made by or licensed for LakeDead.</p>\n<p>Screenshots from development. Not everything still remains in the game or is the same.</p><p>The game may have framerate issues, but I\u00a0believe that's due to the fact that the game room is like 50,000 x 50,000, and there's like 1,000 objects spawned into the room,\u00a0and that it's drawing the view in 1920x1080. Using smaller number in all of those most likely boosts performance. But this is how it is now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f69d611ab48b8e8f74d56863df6b920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LakeDead"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
