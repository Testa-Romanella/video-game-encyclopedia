Initially begun in January 2020, though there were lots of breaks, about 2 1/2 months of casual solo dev it took to create this (I created all assets, programming, animations, sound and music., other than using a Kenney font, and using some of his UI designs as a base.)</p>\n<p>There are 6 Levels Currently including 2 unique Boss Levels. There is a level select system once you have unlocked levels.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is playable with touch controls, mouse, keyboard &amp; gamepad though the ingame menu doesn't yet function with gamepad so you need the mouse for that.</p>\n<p>There is an options menu where you can adjust master audio, music, graphics settings (disables a few FX and godrays on low, use low if performance isn't great, (please don't mess with this on mobile as I am not sure if it wil do bad stuff)) and a reset save function.</p>\n<p>Demo created with Construct 3, Affinity Designer, Tilesetter, Creature2D, JuiceFX, Reason &amp; Fl Studio.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you encounter any bugs or issues!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:52:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/862315ec2668ff94ae1aa2bd3efc8929.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CillianCreates"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
