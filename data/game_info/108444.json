Tonight, everything must go to plan. Nothing out of place. Jessica is <em>waaaay</em> out of your league and you need things to be perfect if you're going to stand a chance with her. Unluckily for you, that might be a little bit more difficult than you expect. <br/></p>\n<p><em>Date Night</em> is a game that tests your ability to ignore what's going on in the world around you. To protect your reality. To keep the world outside, outside. It's a free game we made in Twine, but if you like it please feel free to donate a little something so that we can keep making games like this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb6ec5f069124d51276a5ad2737854d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Drink To Destruction"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
