This whole \"end of the world\" thing is really cutting into your bottom line, but you won't let the hordes of hell stand in the way of selling hats!</p>\n<p>Demon Dash is a combination of Diner Dash-esque management and horde survival with Mega Man style shooting.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Enemies drop hats that you can sell to customers. Killing an enemy changes the color of your\u00a0current hat.</p>\n<p>Customers will ask for a hat of a certain color and shape. Matching one gets you one coin, while matching both gets you two coins. Earn 5 coins to progress to the next level.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys = Move</p>\n<p>X = Jump</p>\n<p>C = Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/536a6310ad1dcb1376f0113e4ee9a290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SuperPokeunicorn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
