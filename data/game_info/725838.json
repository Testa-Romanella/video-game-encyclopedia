When life drops to 0, the game ends. In the game, the tank can carry out power storage attack through the left mouse button. The longer the power storage time, the higher the attack power. It should be noted that when the power storage value reaches 100%, it needs to be re stored, so we must grasp the power storage time to release the bullet.<br/>Enemy tanks include small tanks and large tanks. Compared with small tanks, large tanks have very high attack power and very thick blood. Please be careful when you encounter them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe3bc82a9af96afdc18d43ea9160875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chenchen"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["chenchen"], "esrb_rating": null}
