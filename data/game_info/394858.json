Join forces with a friend and face the challenges and puzzles you have ahead of you. The planet is without color, lifeless and walking to oblivion and the only hope that does not happen, is to search and find the mythical prims scattered throughout the world, and with them, give color to the world again. There are two kingdoms, Luxar (Kingdom of Light) and Unbrat (Kingdom of Shadow), both live in peace but fail to endure life on the planet without the prisms. To find the prims, they appoint a warrior with no fear to seek them. Each character has distinctive abilities, and it will be necessary to use and combine all these skills to progress in the game. The better the communication and understanding between players, the easier the resolution of challenges will be.</p>\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Cooperative GamePlay</li><li>Different Characters with different Skills</li><li>Light &amp; Shadow</li><li>Support for PS4 controllers</li><li>Relaxed Experience</li></ul>\n\r\nAwards &amp; Recognition\r\n<ul><li>\"Official Selection: Gamedev Student Showcase\"\u00a0Universidade Europeia</li><li>\"Official Selection: Lus\u00f3fona Game Showcase\"\u00a0Universidade Lus\u00f3fona de Lisboa</li><li>\"Finalists Playstation Talents Awards 2019\"\u00a0Playstation Talents</li><li>\"Finalists Indie X 2019\"\u00a0Indie X, Moche XL Games World</li><li>\"Runner Up at Nordic Game Discover Contest\"\u00a0Nordic Game\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nAdicional Links<p><strong>Prism Seekers - Contact </strong>- Our main contact<br/>bigaforti@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Prism Seekers - Instagram</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0With this social network, we want to offer a more causal and more timely content.<br/>instagram.com/prismseekers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prism Seekers - Facebook </strong>- Sharing and Promotion of our game, work about the project, some news and relevant information.\u00a0<br/>facebook.com/pg/prismseekers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prism Seekers - Twitter</strong>\u00a0- Updates and connecting\u00a0 with\u00a0people.<br/>\u00a0twitter.com/PrismSeekers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prism Seekers -</strong>\u00a0<strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Show a more professional game and team information.\u00a0<br/>https://www.linkedin.com/company/biga-forti-studio/</p>\n<p><strong>Prism Seekers -\u00a0</strong><strong>Youtube\u00a0</strong>- Here you can find the videos about the game.<br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb8RLfW8Qa02Yo1rFVx4P_w</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>By:\u00a0<br/></strong><strong>Gon\u00e7alo Greg\u00f3rio -</strong> Game Designer<br/><strong>David Patr\u00e3o -</strong> Game Programer<br/><strong>Gustavo Sobral - </strong>Cinematic<br/><strong>Raquel Neves -</strong> Concept and Environment Artist<br/><strong>Rui Barata -</strong> Artist and Animator</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T03:45:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/9371449640955195d6eca9354ca0f8fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PrismSeekers"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
