But it ain't the cold that kills ya, per say.<br/>It's those long lonely nights, the weight of the snow, and what they drive even the littlest elf to do...<br/>Up here, Holly Jolly is the name of that bottle of hooch you keep in the drawer for special occasions, and a nutcracker ballet is something you do to someone who ended up on your own personal Naughty List.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Elf Crimes</em> is a game with the feeling of 40s noir pulp fiction, and the look of a Rankin/Bass holiday special. Dark things happen in twinkle light-lit alleys, and you are all that's left to carry out justice in a world of crooked cops and plutocratic politicians. You got a job to do, and that's the way the cookie crumbles.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T04:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/4840a3592d63649eda58178cbc21a887.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rascal Cat Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
