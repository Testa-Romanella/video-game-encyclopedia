Several monkeys come to join the player and teach them how to play a series of instruments. These instruments include a rock, a drum, two shakers, a xylophone, and a drum set. After you learn each instrument, the members from a local band,\u00a0Soul Human come out from the jungle as anthropomorphic monkeys and perform their funky monkey themed song, \u201cBanana Bop\u201d. The player can jam along with their newfound mastery of these jungle instruments.\u00a0 \u00a0This project premiered at RIT\u2019s Frameless Symposium and was a finalist in MODE Fest 2021. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T04:56:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5ff8d96b001ec62638b22c4407219d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bellearth"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
