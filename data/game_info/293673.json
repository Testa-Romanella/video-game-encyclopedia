It's because the 3 little boys were having fun pranking the man at the man's date with someone. Well, as you know that is not true. Sure the boys tried to trap him, but they did not murder him. He tried to murder them, but they did not care. It's all a pile of abandoned cares out there, or as you can say, Matters.\u00a0</em></strong>You go outside in the middle of no where, and find the boy's houses. You start searching for clues in the houses, But none could be found. But, you went into the room with the basement, and start to have flashbacks. You remember the place!
