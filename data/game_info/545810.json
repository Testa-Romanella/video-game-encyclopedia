The goal is to reach the end of the level for the two characters, before time runs out.</p>\n\n<p>We hope you will have fun, any feedback\u00a0is welcome.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>First level music:</p>\n<p><strong>Water Skiing by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</strong></p>\n\n<p>Main menu music:</p>\n<p><strong>Nintendo 64 by yoitrax | https://soundcloud.com/yoitrax<br/>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com<br/>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US</strong></p>\n\n<p>Footsteps sounds by Fesliyan Studios</p>\n<p>Font: <em>Chocolate Bar</em> by\u00a0Studio Typo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:16:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05c39ccae215cfa70ada9aede9e77b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuentinSauvage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
