Will Hatchet, a young man who recently moved on his own finds himself haunted by a ghost, seemed hell bent on making his life miserable. Using the help of his friends, Jack Forrest and Marie Osborne, he will attempt to uncover the truth behind his tormenter and perhaps find peace.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Winter Jam 2022. Due to a very difficult production filled with inconvenient events, this game is ultimately incomplete. Despite that, I hope people still can appreciate the work my team and I invested on this project.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Direction, Production, Writing: DoubleH\u00a0https://twitter.com/DoubleH_studios</p>\n<p>Spritework: Laney, Candycornskull, Congercine\u00a0https://candycornskull.tumblr.com/\u00a0https://www.congercine.com/</p>\n<p>Backgrounds: Enrique Carmena\u00a0https://www.enriquecarmena.com/color-illustration</p>\n<p>Additional Writing: Dean McKnight\u00a0https://dean-mcknight.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>Programming:\u00a0Alaxend0l, IntStories\u00a0https://mastodon.social/@alaxend0l</p>\n<p>Sound: Kevin Hu\u00a0linktr.ee/chorxs_music</p>\n<p>Voice: Lauren Kong\u00a0https://laurenkong.carrd.co/\u00a0https://twitter.com/LaurenK_VA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T20:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e6614fc8019fea9757e58eb3969150e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["doubleh", "Alaxend0l", "candycornskull"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
