Well luckily, now there is a whole game based on it! :)</p>\n\n<p>In Quest Quest, you are visit Quest Village and are mistaken for the towns handyman, Ash! Unfortunately for you, Ash has some debt and the townsfolk want you to pay off that debt.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You don't need a mouse to play! Quest Quest can be completely played with a gamepad or just a keyboard!</strong></p>\n<p>Quest Quest was made in 3 days and intended to be part of the 'Easy Jam' game jam. Due to outside issues, Quest Quest couldn't be part of it. You cannot lose in Quest Quest, but it can take you longer to finish the game!</p><p>Games Designer and Programmer - @TigerCollins<br/>Dialogue and Quest Designer - @FinleyCameron</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T11:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a58f91b3cd5519dd9aa808bb8fb6261a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tiger Collins"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
