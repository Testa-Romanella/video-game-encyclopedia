{"id": 151713, "slug": "ocas-birds", "name": "Oca's Birds", "name_original": "Oca's Birds", "description": "<p>Project for Game Studio I class, Fall 2016.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is an expansion of a prototype originally made by Shelley Chen, expanded on by me and Mel Kim. In the original game, the player finds themselves sitting on a tree branch, accompanied by a small blue bird. Clicking the bird causes it to play its melody. Several holes along the tree branch represent the notes that the player can play with their Ocarina - if the player plays the bird's melody correctly, they will be met with a colorful sunrise.</p>\n<p>In this expansion, there is no longer just one melody that is the same every time. A melody is generated procedurally, using a Markov Chain Algorithm. At first, there is one bird, who will play 3 notes. Upon matching those notes, a new bird will appear with a new 3 notes. Playing the entire melody up until the most recent addition will summon yet another bird, until there are 4 birds, 12 notes in total. Playing the full melody will bring about the sunrise, as well as some new bird friends! This version also features improved UI from the original, with a separate Ocarina UI rather than holes distributed across the tree branch, and indications over the birds for when you are playing the right or wrong notes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/287/2873788a779416c004c76cab22c230f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Costrell"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
