Hence a solution in the form of an interactive AR application is conceived.</p>\n<p>This application allows the user to have more ease of access to a more effective learning aid, allowing them to visualize the study material in question and obtaining a better understanding of it since they will be able to interact with \"the real thing\" right in front of their eyes through the lens something as common as a smartphone.</p>\r\nInteraction Design\r\n\n<p>The buttons that exist in the app serve to rotate the models in directions that are relevant, allowing the user to view the models from all sorts of angles, immersing themselves into a better headspace and understanding of the object of study at their own leisure.</p>\n<p>A world space canvas was used to create the multiple buttons that exist on the different images that can be scanned to produce an image. Once clicked, the 3D model displayed will rotate in the direction that the button implies. To stop the rotation and change the direction of rotation, simply push any other button once and then the button associated with the\u00a0desired direction of rotation, it could not be more simple.</p>\r\nTechnical Development\r\n<p>it was previously mentioned that this application would be used on smart devices such as smartphones but for this specific version of the project, it is designed to be used on windows instead. as for any profound reasoning as to why...... there really isn't one, not one that's profound anyways. Simply speaking i just found it easier under my current circumstances to this with windows instead for the time being. Tragic I know.</p>\n<p>Putting that aside, the basis of this application is made using Vuforia video tracking in unity to track specific image targets tot orientate the 3D models in relation to the camera and the image target's position.</p>\n<p>The user would then be able to tap on the buttons that show up on their screens to interact with the 3D models.</p>\r\n\r\nPossible Problems with implementation &amp; Project Appendix\r\n<p><strong>Possible Problems with implementation:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- one of the main problems I can see\u00a0with undergoing this project would be obtaining the specific 3D models needed which more often than not would require hiring someone to make them from scratch</p>\n<p>- occlusion and possible stains on the textbooks could also cause it so that the image target\u00a0is unable to be tracked by the camera</p>\n<p><strong>Project Appendix:</strong></p>\n<p>- an attempt was made to include a function where-in tapping a specified part of the model would show a small pop up window using a world canvas to give a description of the part in question, evidence of which is a random 3D collision box present on one part of the skeleton. Needless to say, the fact that this is being mentioned here means that it never got past development due to a simple lack of time.</p>\n\n<p>- the 3 bunnies hopping around a giant sprout admittedly are of no educational importance whatsoever but instead serve to be more of a proof of concept that multiple 3D models can occupy the same image target and be interacted with all at once. The lack of buttons that let you control\u00a0vertical rotations is also simply because I saw no purpose to include it.</p>\n\n<p><em>( ignore the blue T's and imagine if left and right arrows were there instead )</em></p>\r\nReferences\r\n<p><em><strong>a big part of the code used in the scripts were used from this video tutorial:\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>3D models:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p> -\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/simple-skeleton-15...</p>\n<p>-\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/kawaii-slime-22117...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T15:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea745b1aa5f292d7348ecab29b19ddef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owennnnnnnnnnn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
