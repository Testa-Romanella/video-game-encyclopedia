The game has been fully redesigned since the original version, and it now features spectacular gameplay never before seen in any other arkanoid type clone.</em><br/><br/><em>Grab the different bonuses and watch as this classic game takes on a whole new dimension.</em><br/><em>Ultranium4 also features a new set of levels with very different themes that make the game a lot more interesting to play.</em><br/><br/><em>Along with these new breathtaking graphics is a surprisingly complete soundtrack that will in itself make you want to keep playing the game.</em><br/><br/><em>In short, Ultranium4 really represents the best of traditional two-dimensional breakout games. Although simple in concept, once the game is in your hands you will quickly realize that the possibilites in this one are endless. Trying to keep up with the game's fast pace proves to be a real challenge, and as the levels become harder and more diversified you will truly enjoy this classic game.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bf4712b6204597dffa3b9b3331347a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brizzlyy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
