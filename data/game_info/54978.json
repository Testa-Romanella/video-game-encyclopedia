It is platform-based shoot 'em up marred with loading times that many users described as \"unbearable\". Unlike most other Psygnosis titles such as Shadow of the Beast and Brataccas, this game didn't break any new ground, or receive critical or commercial success. While it does feature Psygnosis's trademark overall macabre mood, it is one of the few of the company's games to go without their usual psychedelic Roger Dean artwork on the cover. The cover artwork was created by Melvyn Grant.</p>\n<p>On the Amiga, the power indicator light flashed in time with the soundtrack.</p>\n<p>The PC version was ported by Tim Ansell of The Creative Assembly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af86311bbbb33d10ff7a292b4e5cfd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["SCE Studio Liverpool", "Psygnosis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SCE Studio Liverpool", "Psyclapse"], "esrb_rating": null}
