Your character was put into a small bottle world. Find items to remove obstacles and help him to escape.</p>\n<p>I used the Ludum Dare 38 Game Jam and the theme <em>A Small World</em> as an opportunity to develop my very first game. It was fun and I was able to learn alot.</p>\n<p>The game was developed with the Godot Engine. I never used this engine before LD38. I have to say, it works out better than expected.  Sounds was made with sfxr.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for give it a try. I would be happy about your feedback and appreciate that you take the time to try it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sound isn't working in the web version</li><li>Fullscreen mode is enabled in the web version, but shouldn't - please play in the window mode, you will have a better experience and performance</li></ul>\n<p>Source Code on GitHub</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d97d243b0f584b080a3cbe38db189ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Twaldigas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
