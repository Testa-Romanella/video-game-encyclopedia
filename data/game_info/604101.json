{"id": 604101, "slug": "escape-avenge", "name": "Escape & Avenge", "name_original": "Escape & Avenge", "description": "You\u2019re trapped in the dungeon of a medieval town. The king imprisoned you and killed the wizard--your magical friend and accomplice--for trying to overthrow the crown. At least that\u2019s what the note on the wall says. You can\u2019t remember anything, including who you are or how you got here. Can you escape the dungeon, return to the castle, and avenge your friend\u2019s death?<br/><br/>Escape and Avenge is an unconventional text-based adventure that reimagines the genre for mobile. With a couple quick taps, you can chain together any command you want--the perfect blend of speed, accuracy, and range of actions! Throw in some minimalist visual mini games and puzzles and you\u2019ve got a new spin on interactive fiction!<br/><br/>There are no ads or IAP--just a poor soul trapped in a dungeon who is looking for help.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c7209b7a7d50d06aea8cb41e6149e3_h6B0YuB.jpg", "website": "http://hangzone.com/escape-and-avenge", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["HangZone"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["HangZone"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
