{"id": 339936, "slug": "magnetic-bonds-demo-3-overtime", "name": "Magnetic Bonds: Demo 3 - Overtime", "name_original": "Magnetic Bonds: Demo 3 - Overtime", "description": "<p>This demo contains the Scarecrows prologue from the previous demo in addition to a <strong>new</strong> short storyline featuring Isaac, Jean, Sparta, and Avicenna. <strong>I would recommend playing the prologue before the 'Game Start' option if you are not familiar with the gameplay, as otherwise, you will be taken straight to a boss battle.</strong></p>\n<p>The conversation you can have with each character in Alcor's Hub changes after each battle you beat. The dialogue choices don't influence the game at the moment, but the hope is that, in the future, improving your relationship with characters can unlock team attacks.</p>\n<p>The battle system has been slightly changed in an attempt to re-balance it. Though still timer-based, skills no longer add to your wait time. As characters wait, they accumulate Overtime (OT), which is needed for skills to perform at max damage or to proc their battle effects. By default, time does not progress when selecting a skill or target, however, you have the option of enabling this in Settings whether you are outside or inside of battle.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls in cut scenes are:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space or Left click</strong> to progress</p>\n<p><strong>Hold Left-Shift or Right Click</strong> to skip the segment and go right to battles.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controls in battle are:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arrow </strong>keys: Navigate combat menus.</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong>: Select, <strong>Shift</strong>: Cancel, <strong>Tab</strong>: Enable/disable the battle log Escape: Pause</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong>: Rotate through active characters (left).
