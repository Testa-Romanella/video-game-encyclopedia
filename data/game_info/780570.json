This game required two buttons, one for attacking and one for jumping. The sprite control took a lot of effort for this game, but I'm happy with the result. Accessibility control was difficult, but I'm happy with the overall look and smooth controlling of the game. This game was made the free resources pack from YoYo Games.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>\n<p>On my site I create games that can be played with a single input device, allowing my games to accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>All games can be played using just the left-mouse-button; no mouse movement required.</p>\n<p>I have set up games to play with just the left mouse button, or any other input device directly or via a switch unit that can 'register' a left mouse click.</p>\n<p>For info on my games, please visit: www.EasyToPlayGames.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T12:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe9/fe9699865c7279c0874a7ebcfba9479d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Easy To Play Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
