The 2nd control scheme is a bit weird and hence I wouldn't recommend it, but if the first does not work for you, try the 2nd one.</p>\n<p>The first control scheme moves toward the direction you press, and try to go towards it in the fastest possible way.</p>\n<p>The second control scheme is just \"A\" for anti clockwise, and \"D\" for clockwise. It will not be easy to control while\u00a0 you are at the bottom since D is now used to move left, and A is now used to move right.</p>\n<p>Font used: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T06:17:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae7da014febe76422aaf2f02a9796b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZwodahS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
