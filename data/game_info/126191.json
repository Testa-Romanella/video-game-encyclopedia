While there is no real end to this game and is just an endless mode at its core, feel free to see how well you can do.</p><p>This game was made by just 2 people using unreal 4 in the span of 3 weeks.<br/></p><p>We hope to make a more complete version in the future with a more fleshed out endless mode along with a story mode with some bosses. However we both have college to attend to and feel that this prototype of sorts will hopefully gauge interest in the concept. We encourage you to try out this game of sorts and if you can send us some feedback here or at our email: magdalenastudiosnm@gmail.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a64ca205ab580d8b16c5364aaf68853c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MagdalenaStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
