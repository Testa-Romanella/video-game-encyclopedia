Added 3 unique levels. The third especially is challenging and requires use of strategy and understanding of game navigation (40 Enemies).</p>\n<p>2. Added unique enemy, which looks like a square space station which fires out of all four corners of the enemy.</p>\n<p>3. Added planetary obstacles (giving the game its name). These planets are large and limit the navigation of the player, but add another element of challenge.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Jackson Tatge</p><p>(NOTE: Yet again, I\u00a0have been attempting to build the WebGL version, but on every attempt Unity freezes and crashes. I have followed instructions perfectly and watched multiple help videos but nothing has worked quite yet. Hopefully the Windows and MacOS versions are enough for full credit, I don't know at all what is causing the problem)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf5d1b89cf7df26360ce216670b64615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jtatge7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
