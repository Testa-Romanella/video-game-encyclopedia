Unfortunately, her magical sword was made by an crazy wizard/blacksmith chap who decided to make it out of Osmium.</p><p>To rid the forest of the evil creatures, you must drop your heavy sword and then recall it to your hand, killing anything the is stood in its way.<br/>-------<br/><br/>WSAD, arrows or GamePad to move.<br/>Lots of other buttons are the fire button, press this to turn into a faerie and press it again to recall your sword.</p><p>Faerie form also drains the forest of colour, so try to spend as much time as a human as possible.</p><p>-------<br/><br/>N.B: Can't get the switching screensize working on Mac yet so sadly it's stuck on fullscreen for now. There's also issues with the text layering, which I can't fix because it's against the rules of the jam</p><p>I'll be working more on the game once I've played and rated as many other entries as I can. I'm thinking of turning it into something between Super Ghouls &amp; Ghosts and Legend of The Mystical Ninja.</p><p><strong>Mac users may have to enable \"Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere\" in Security &amp; Privacy settings</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe6/fe6512fe51b5abcee546c8f59e0178bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Triple Vision Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
