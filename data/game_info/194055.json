The dog is locked up in a cage in the lowest underground floor because he and his girlfriend got caught and locked up by the company. Suddenly, the dog manages to escape his cage and wants to find his girlfriend. He is fighting his way to the ground floor of the building so he can escape. Before he escapes, he wants to find his girlfriend, which is sadly not locked up in the same floor like him. So, he fights his way through every floor/stage. On his way, he has to avoid obstacles like guards, cameras and get around the space which is populated by normal furniture which also serves as an obstacle.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The main character is moved with arrows on the keyboard.
