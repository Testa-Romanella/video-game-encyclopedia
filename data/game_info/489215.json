The player takes on the role of a cat unlike any other, an anthropomorphic cat who uses trickery and deceit to steal food to feed other homeless cats in the local area. The player breaks into the local Kaiten-zushi and fetches sushi from feudal era bamboo style water belts then delivers these treats to weary cats awaiting on the restaurant\u2019s exterior windows. As the masterful robin hood cat continues to steal sushi and progress through the levels, the player will be met with ever increasing obstacles such as angry chefs, impatient wait staff, clumsy patrons and a complex array of hallways and cooking benches to tackle!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T07:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3de/3de322a8851c12f3d2f65bdd996664d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blake Simpson", "Cryptic_Creation", "cracklez"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
