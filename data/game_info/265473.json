The aim of the game, as in regular Desert Bus,  is to travel from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada and back again.</p>\n<p>There are 2072 screens and it takes approximately 14 seconds with perfect inputs to cross a screen. Consequently it will take at least 8 real time hours to achieve a single point (assuming perfect inputs, which is hard because the bus still veers to the right). Enjoy that authentic Desert Bus experience!</p>\n<p>Here are the things that are procedurally generated in the game:</p>\n<ul><li>The scenery you will see at the side of the road.</li><li>What Tucson and Las Vegas look like at either end</li><li>Where along the road the bus stops appear on the fixed screens they are specified to appear on</li></ul>\n<p>Here are the things that are not procedurally generated in the game:</p>\n<ul><li>Anything that would meaningfully affect the gameplay experience in any way.</li></ul>\n<p>Desert Bus features that are implemented in roguelike mockery form here:</p>\n<ul><li>Everything.</li><li>Seriously, if you're prepared to wait for them, we even got the bug splat and the borked day/night cycle in here, and both those and the  bus stops happen on turn numbers equivalent to their timestamps in the real game (again, assuming perfect input).</li></ul>\n<p>The controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys or All 8 radial Numpad keys or QWEADZXC: Movement</li><li>Numpad 5 or Space or S: Wait</li><li>, or J: Arm Horn. Advancing a turn by moving, waiting or opening the doors will then sound the horn.</li><li>. or K: Open Doors (available only when adjacent to a bus stop)</li></ul>\n<p>Things you should try: Sounding the horn, crashing and holding the wait key to wait for the tow truck, donating to the Desert Bus For Hope charity fundraiser at desertbus.org.<br/>Things you could try: Getting to the first bus stop on screen 6, stopping there and opening and closing the doors.<br/>Things you shouldn't try: Getting a point, continuing to subject yourself to this awful experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e17aef9012e956168fb6640e69464ca2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CleverCrumbish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
