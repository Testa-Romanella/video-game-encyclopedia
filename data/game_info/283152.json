You are finally old enough to drive that car you\u2019ve been eyeing forever. You get up early, grab the keys and go to the driveway. But wait, aren\u2019t you forgetting something? You need something called a driver\u2019s license or at least a learner\u2019s permit to start with.<br/><br/>What are old friends for if not helping out their friends in need. Here we are simulating the whole process of getting a driving license for you. So hang the keys for a while and familiarise yourself with the rules and regulations of a driving license. Check your vehicle engine, brake paddles, mirror angles and keep one foot on the race pedal and the other on the brake. You have to check the clearance, use the correct signals before making a turn and make sure you drive safe. Don\u2019t forget to park safe as well. You have to earn enough points so that you can get your permit. Needless to say you should avoid crashes or smashing in other vehicles and buildings. You will be penalised for each violation. With that, it is all yours.<br/><br/>Enjoy the game and let us know what you think. We will be waiting for your suggestions &amp; feedback.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e14219201b5ec6ce27c57a290fc652aa_Vhz8Jrm.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["elinx technologies"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": ["elinx technologies"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
