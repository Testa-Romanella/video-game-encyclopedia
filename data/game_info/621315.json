Use your moons as defense and offence but be careful not to loose them or else you have nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first game jam I am entering. It was a lot of work but I think I did a good job! I made everything myself and I had so much fun trying to pull it all together. The most fun part was making the main music. (the title and game over tracks are old tunes I had made for practice). I thought a planet and moons being joined together was a fun take on the theme. I wanted to do something more physics-y with gravity but I didn't know how. Still I think it turned out fun!!\u00a0<br/><br/>Tell me what you think and any advice you have! The game was made in clickteam fusion 2.5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T22:20:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c938c7f62ad0091b08f1900bbea675a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Artwish"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
