{"id": 768738, "slug": "hot-spud", "name": "Hot Spud", "name_original": "Hot Spud", "description": "<p>Hot Spud is a mashup of ideas from Breakout and Pinball machines with high score mechanics inspired by Geometry Wars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demo of the game features two adventures that contain different stages, and completely different looking bricks within. It is fully functional, but there are some rough edges to it at this stage and some missing audio (but there's still a lot of sound effects present.)\u00a0There is a \"how to play\"\u00a0menu in the game that explains the controls and general game rules. I\u00a0will write information about all of the available powerups soon.</p>\n<p>The game saves after each stage is completed so you can leave and resume the adventures any time. There will be leaderboards at the end of the adventure eventually, but these are not yet built.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any feedback, or if you enjoyed this game!\u00a0Thank you and have fun :).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T08:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/878d4e1306724a995eaa62b3ea8ca952.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ahhsumx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
