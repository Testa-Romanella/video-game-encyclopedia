As this is my first game jam, any and all feedback would be much appreciated.\u00a0I learned a lot and am surprised I was able to build a fully functioning level with all game-play mechanics in a week! I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a knight attempting to reach the castle in your happy little world. But things seem to be wrong, Skeletons are ambling around screaming out of tune, and your jump power is way to much for a Knight.</p>\n<p>Goal: Reach the castle<br/></p>\n<p>Side Goal: Get all of the coins</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use A &amp; D to move left and right. Use space to jump. Use the Left Mouse Button to swing your sword!</p>\n<p>Note: Due to this weird day in Knight history, you can jump up walls. Whatever that means.</p>\n\n<p>Assets Used:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>Landscape: Kenney Assets<ol><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack-medieval</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-extended-tileset</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/background-elements-redux</li><li>https://kenney.nl/assets/foliage-pack</li></ol></li><li>Player Character: Sven Thole<ol><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/bandits-pixel-art-104130</li></ol></li><li>Enemies:<ol><li>Evgeniy Luch</li></ol></li><li>Coins: Bayat Games<ol><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-platform-game-assets-8583</li></ol></li><li>Health Bar: Brackeys<ol><li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfNP4Sc_iA&amp;t=632s</li></ol></li><li>Font, Knight's Quest: GemFonts<ol><li>https://www.dafont.com/knights-quest.font</li></ol></li><li>Music:\u00a0Rizwan Ashraf<ol><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/free-music-tracks-for-games-156413</li></ol></li><li>Sound Effects: Kronbits<ol><li>https://kronbits.itch.io/freesfx</li></ol></li><li>Dialogue System: Brackeys<ol><li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRzoTzeyxU&amp;t=54s</li></ol></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:22:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1e59202128dc412b80138c70aa95a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PVP Coalition"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
