What if your'e a trans guy? An interactive story with a forum theatre prompt at the end. </p><p>Content warning: This game is designed as a stimulus text for a forum piece, based on Forum Theatre.

This game deals with gender dysphoria around menstruation, menstrual taboos more generally, and exam stress. It may be difficult or upsetting to read if you have experienced any of the above. </p><p>The game code is available for anyone who would like to write additional scenes suggested on the final page. You can also post 'story improvements' in the comments. </p><p>If you want to read more about Forum Theatre and Theatre of The Oppressed, look up work by Augusto Boal. </p><p>This game was designed for the One Day Jam and purchase of this game bundle will support Action for Trans Health, a UK based peer-advocacy organisation. It can be played by young people from secondary school age onward and adults of all genders whether they menstruate or not.
