Now resist until reinforcements arrive. Just remember one thing: DON'T DROP IT. DON'T F*CKING LOSE IT.\"</p>\n<p>This game I made in about one week. I wanted to learn about beat 'em ups and synchronization of animation and game logics. It's still in development, as there are still some bugs in the game, but I think that it's pretty playable as it is now. <br/></p>\n<p>I'm a programmer with absolutely no art skills and there was no way I could've created all those models, textures and sounds alone. There is still no \"credits\" screen, but I will put here where I got each resource:</p>\n<p>The warehouse scenario: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3439</p>\n<p>The bodyguards models: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/31711</p>\n<p>The main player: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/84232</p>\n<p>The food pickups: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/85884</p>\n<p>The dying sounds: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32785</p>\n<p>The ground texture: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/70619</p>\n<p>The punch sound: https://freesound.org/people/JewTwinz/sounds/244513/</p>\n<p>The pickup sound: https://freesound.org/people/Koops/sounds/20281/</p>\n<p>All animations: www.mixamo.com</p>\n<p>Footstep sound: https://freesound.org/people/Fantozzi/sounds/166299/<br/></p>\n<p>Phew!
