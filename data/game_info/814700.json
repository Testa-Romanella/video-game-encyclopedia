Here is that link.</p>\n<p>Its mainly a random creature collecting game where you have to click the 'try' button and it randomizes the calbie you get. Calbies are small creatures that have varying possibilities! There isn't much for me to explain right now, so you can go play it yourself!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is also a ported version of the game which runs outside of scratch, making it faster. This was achieved with Turbowarp, a mod for scratch which allowed me to compile the game into javascript.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is currently in development!</strong></p>\n<p>It is not finished at the time being which is why\u00a0 it is so empty. I hope you enjoy the husk it is right now before it gets some updates!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T13:17:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711f5666558f9e730f8a981ab9217e03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SlyBuilds Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
