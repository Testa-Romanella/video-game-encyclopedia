Press the trigger and drag to move movable objects. You can use both of your\u00a0hands.</p>\n<p>Movable objects have a not very distinct <strong>outline</strong> so be observant.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Issues:</strong> Yeah, i know that it would be much better if the game did stop simulation if one of the sheep fall into the abyss, but somehow this feature broke the game, so.... sorry. I'll try to add this feature one day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the physics\u00a0behave badly you can try to resimulate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is not suitable for every setup\u00a0because it demands some free space.</p>\n<p><strong>Time to beat:\u00a06-60 minutes.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Overall:</strong> it's a simple game with fun (i think) gameplay so good luck and enjoy your play!</p>\n<p><strong>Made by:\u00a0</strong>Pavel Smolin (SmVynt)</p>\n<p><em>Game created for a UE4JAM.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:57:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bb/2bbda5b097da596e99aa348869eb8d89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmVynt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
