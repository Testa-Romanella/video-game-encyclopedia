Each fighter has a unique move set based off of their interests and hobbies. The first wave of fighters are as follows; Kaden: the well rounded \"default\", Nolan: the defensive and forceful fighter, Casey: the guitar-wielding swift fighter, Yash: the glass cannon who uses technology to his advantage, Marshall: the towering damage sponge, and Hugo: the dexterous and strategic fighter. However, there will be more fighters and maps added in the future!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this project was made for fun and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Instagram: @crosbrawl_arena</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: This game is not online.
