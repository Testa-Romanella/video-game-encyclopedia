He is responsible for many different people\u2019s death. Some readers were unsatisfied with how the book ended so I created this game to try to let the reader take control of the book and for them to try to create an ending more enjoyable. Even though some details are similar to the actual play, most events would never take place because of the characters we have been introduced to, but that is what I intended to do. <em>Othello</em> was a very good play but after finishing it, I was just left with more questions and what the writer could have changed to make it more interesting. While designing the game script, my main goal was to be as creative as possible and go in a very different direction than what Shakespeare wanted, but I wanted to share my method of designing the game with the player.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T20:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9aeab379fbdae756b225756c65d292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["addgar22"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
