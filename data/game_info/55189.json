{"id": 55189, "slug": "t-mek", "name": "T-MEK", "name_original": "T-MEK", "description": "<p>T-MEK is a two-player, sit-down, virtual reality fighting arcade game developed by Atari Games and published by Time Warner Interactive in 1994. Each player can choose their MEK (a hovering tank with special weapons and abilities). One player can play against 6 AI players and the occasional boss, or two players can play against each other and 4 AI players. There is a special tournament mode where two players can go one on one. Up to three T-MEK cabinets can be linked for six-player competitions. T-MEK was later ported to MS-DOS and the Sega 32X; rather than linking multiple systems together, the home versions featured split-screen multiplayer for two players.</p>\n<p>T-MEK featured surround sound, which Time Warner Interactive advertised as \"CAGE Audio\". Each player's station had four speakers; two in front and two behind the player, and a subwoofer mounted directly below the seat. T-MEK has no background music soundtrack, which was a departure for \"deluxe\" arcade games in the coming-of-age era of digitally sampled audio, and instead relied upon the sound to help aid the player in finding enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cff/cff634f3db6abab5ac89bf1ddd243b75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA 32X", "PC"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": null}
