Those 6 elements which are <strong>Earth</strong>, <strong>Fire</strong>, <strong>Frost</strong>, <strong>Lightning</strong>, <strong>Air </strong>and <strong>Water</strong>, each represent a spell school while casting spells.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Each spell either generates or spends an Essence. Essences are unique to each spell school which are <strong>Death</strong>, <strong>Chaos</strong>, <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Arcane</strong>, <strong>Light </strong>and <strong>Nature</strong>. If a spell requires an essence and you don\u2019t have it you won\u2019t be able to cast that spell. You need to cast spells that generate essences before you can cast spells that uses those essences.</p>\n<p>In order to cast spells, you can click on the symbols of the elements and combine three of them. You will see that when you click on an element it will go into a <strong>Socket</strong>, you can click on the socket to remove the element.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can check what spells you can cast from the <strong>Spell Book</strong> that is on the bottom left with the book icon or you can just press \u201cP\u201d on your keyboard. While you have the spell book open you can click on the top left book icon to expand to the bigger spell book that has a more detailed explanation for each spell.</p>\n<p>To cast a spell, you need to combine 3 elements with their correct order, you can check the order from either the small or the big spell book. After selecting your elements, you can press on the Wand icon that is on the top right of the elements UI or press \u201cSpace\u201d on your keyboard to cast your spell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To cast spells fast, there are several options you can follow. You can click on a spell in the spell book to automatically place the elements in the required order into the sockets. Alternatively, you can press <strong>1 through 6 on either your numpad or the keyboard, as well as use Q W E A S D to cast</strong> them in the order you see on the screen.</p>\n<p>You can cast <strong>3 spells each turn</strong>. A turn is determined by your 3 spell casts and each enemies\u2019 actions. After each enemy has done their action, you can cast spells again.</p>\n<p>You can always determine your targeted enemy by the glow around their healthbar and name. This glow also is around their models. To switch your target you can click on an enemy, and also use the arrow keys to go to the next or previous enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After defeating an enemy pack, you get some rewards. Which include experience for meta progression (the usage is not implemented yet), some gold for in-run convenience (the usage is not implemented yet), and with a certain chance an Artifact. Artifacts go into your bag on the bottom right and do various things. If you have a full bag of artifacts and another one drops after an encounter, you can switch a single artifact with a new one simply by clicking on an Artifact on the bag screen you see on the right side of the screen, or alternatively you can recycle the artifact into gold.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to defeat the end boss The Discomancer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would really appreciate if you would also join our Discord.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the team:</p>\n<ul><li>Efe Ayvaz: Coding, VFX, Animation, UI\u00a0Scripting</li><li>Ismail Cem Seckin: Game Design,\u00a0Combat\u00a0Design, Sound Design,\u00a0Music</li><li>Ozge Eser: UI Design, Animation, 3D Modelling, 2D Art</li><li>Robin Basibuyuk: Coding, VFX, Animation, Combat\u00a0Design</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T07:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c3d846ac6c1d32d7861baf3c751ded3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greendroid", "ImperialSwag", "ICS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
