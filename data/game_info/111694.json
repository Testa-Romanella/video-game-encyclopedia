You should probably get those out of there. 3 of them, at least.</p>\n<p><em>memBrain</em> is my entry for the Ludum Dare 42, with the theme being 'Running out of Space'. You play as a little robot, exploring the abandoned facility and collecting all 3 launch codes. There's just one issue. You have a very limited amount of memory in your cassette tape hard drive, and along the way you also need to scan rooms in order to be able to see them, and collect keycodes to open locked doors. Next time, send in a robot with more than 7kb of memory.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>W/A/S/D - Move</p>\n<p>Q/E or Mousewheel - Select memory slot</p>\n<p>X/DEL - Delete stuff in selected memory slot</p>\n<p>R - Restart<br/></p><p>Launch Codes look like black floppy disks with red particles<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ff48b855b744cc593dc09193b216081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Sciman101"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
