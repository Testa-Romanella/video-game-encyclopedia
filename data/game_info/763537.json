Well, I sure hope not.\u00a0But still, now you can! shoot it out and battle for the most points, all on one device! A Square Fight has a VERY minimalistic art style, with customizable games! you can choose the winning score, and even set the names of the players. There is also a practice mode for players who just wanna try out the gameplay, although the AI is very limited. You can even get power-ups! Right now there is only one, (The Swirl), but I hope to expand that in the future if this game continues.</p><p>NOTE: I am aware the aspect ratio and cropping are messed up. It will be fixed in the future :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T23:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c2476c82b2964b584ac29d0623a5df76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nintenvlogz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
