The robots that were produced had a fault that made them attack people instead of help. As the only worker at the factory, it is up to you to stop the robot outbreak. But beware, these robots have become sentient. The robot printing machinery has tapped into the factory\u2019s camera network and is analysing how its robots are being destroyed. It will adjust what it prints in order to get as many robots as it can through your defences.<br/></p>\n<p>You have to stave of the robot outbreak. The company has a rule that if more than 50 faulty robots of any kind are shipped out everyone gets fired. In order to prevent this you can build and maintain factory machinery: robot arms, crushers, cutting lasers, tesla coils and acid etchers. The creation, maintenance and upgrading of this machinery will require scrap material which you get from destroying the robots. </p>\n<p><strong>Robellion is a work in progress\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Anne: Team leader, Programmer, Level creation<br/>Daniel: Programmer<br/>Steph: Design, 3D modelling<br/>Jay: Programmer, Level Creation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07d/07db434b8b8585e65a1128b83d352ce9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.faulkner"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
