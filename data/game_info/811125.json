I'd like to add music, enemies that you need to direct the magnet at to kill, a dash power-up, and maybe a more defined goal like survive 5 minutes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:18:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06c6d6499f23c7b3e3a62bf1f9db260b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ikado"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
