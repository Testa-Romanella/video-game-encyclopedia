Looking at Multiplayer maps as my inspiration I attempted to build a balanced environment for various game modes from Team Deathmatch to things like Domination.<br/></p>\n<p>In an attempt to balance this while iterating\u00a0on it I used LAN party's to gather feedback from players.\r\n</p>\n<p>Although this was particularly effective the FPS Framework which I used had very basic AI so the bots were not very skilled when coming up against real players.\r\n</p>\n<p>To combat this I would have liked to find a larger\u00a0player base to test with two non AI teams.</p>\n<p>This project took\u00a0 me 8 weeks on and off around working full time and was completing using Unreal engine 4 as well as 3DS max for a few pieces that were a little more complicated than the BSP system could handle.\r\n</p>\r\nNotes about Play:\r\n<p>Although the main menu lists multiple modes for play, currently only Free For All, Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed work as they should.</p>\n<p>For a best experience run as a LAN game with two teams of real life humans, or play a game of team deathmatch as you vs 16 veteran bots!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T12:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba18a5c0cd43c01c2f7ff87fb2dfe393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liam Peachey"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
