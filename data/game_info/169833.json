( Copy Paste Error in the Level )</li><li>When pillars collapse their is a weird scaling issue shortly before they disappear. </li></ul><p>Future Improvements ( If i have time to work on this )</p><ul><li>Generate more pillars if the player reached the edge of the maze.</li><li>Nicer movement animations of the player.</li><li>Sound and Music.</li><li>Try out some kind of enemies or different kind of pillars.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f1056564e2057e9aa3967dda33fd64c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joerg Reisig"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
