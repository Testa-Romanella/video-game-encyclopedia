With his power, the necromancer raised numerous henchmen and allied himself with many formidable leaders. Skelly, a skeleton raised from the dead by the necromancer finds himself enslaved and doing the necromancer\u2019s bidding. With no memories of who he is, Skelly always pondered the reason why he must serve the necromancer.</p>\n<p>Curious by nature, Skelly one day peered inside a forbidden room during his two minute work break for the day. He was instantly blinded by a mysterious illuminated object in the middle of the room. Cautiously approaching what appeared to be a crystal ball, Skelly was immediately overwhelmed with flashes of images of other kingdoms and its inhabitants. He saw fairs, carnivals, parties, and most importantly of all: people. He observed families spending time together, all with large smiles on their faces. It was at this moment, Skelly resolved to leave Daceo\u2019s kingdom and started to fabricate a plan to escape. Navigating through the crystal ball, Skelly realizes he must first cross over the Goblin Boss\u2019s territory.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938f116a0659b51067c58eb4bf2ca56b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Team Working Title", "Elvert Perez", "Sean Carpenter", "ParkerDSoto", "thetimgee", "RMasui"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
