So you've decided to make your own perfect match. You go on a dating show and must make yourself look the\u00a0opposite to your date. The catch? You don't know what your date looks like!\r\n<p>You have a limited amount of questions to ask your date to try and determine what they look like and then transform your body to look the opposite.</p>\n<p>Some pairs are more \"opposite\" than others. So for example you may get a good score just not having the same traits as your date, but to get the best score you must also choose the \"perfect opposite\" of a trait as well (for example fat &lt;-&gt; skinny).</p>\n<p>At the end of a game you will get a chart that shows how spot on (or not) your guess was!</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to play, click on a body part on you (the person on the left) to change it. To ask questions simply click the \"Ask a Question?\" sign or click on your date on the right.</p>\n<p>M to mute sound.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! Made for Xander Jam 4.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE: I DO NOT CONDONE THE IDEA THAT LOVE IS PURELY BASED ON PHYSICAL ATTRACTION. THIS IS JUST A SILLY GAME!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T07:13:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e30aaa984c723f0eb0349370798bbdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Jet Simon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
