Rearrange his plans to make sure you both survive the battles that await you.\r\n</p>\r\n\u2694\ufe0f Gameplay Description\r\n<p><strong>Turn-based strategy game</strong> where you don't get to pick the actions you take but have to make do with what the hero provides you with. He can be quite stubborn so you only have a few suggestions to give him before his ego gets hurt which makes him more vulnerable to attacks. But if you leave his perfect plan untouched (as in encouraging it), his ego will get boosted which has its own benefits.</p>\r\n\u2757 Tips/Rules\r\n<ul><li>Preferably <strong>play downloaded version</strong> instead of browser one (custom mouse cursor with helpful visuals is not present in browser version)</li><li>Chrome version isn't stable</li><li><strong>Fullscreen </strong>recommended</li><li>Whenever you <strong>swap actions the hero loses an ego point</strong></li><li>When you spend all of the hero's ego points, he will be so distraught he takes double damage</li><li>If you leave the hero's plan untouched you gain an ego point and a bonus action for next turn</li><li>Passive abilities appear below a character's life bar</li><li>Top row actions are enemy actions, bottom row actions are hero actions</li><li>Actions aligned vertically will be executed at the same time, in case of only one action being present only that one gets executed with no others (basically it's a freebie)</li></ul>\r\n\ud83c\udfae Controls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Mouse + Left Click </strong>- Almost everything</li><li><strong>[P] </strong>- Pause mid battle (battle speed is changeable from there)</li><li><strong>[F] </strong>- Toggle fullscreen</li><li><strong>[Esc] </strong>- Exit fullscreen</li></ul>\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1 Credits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Design, Programming &amp; Writing</strong> - Krasimir Balchev\u00a0 a.k.a. krasi0707</li><li><strong>Design &amp; Art</strong> - poopie<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Music</strong> - Jaedan Calladine<br/>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T08:28:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32b/32bd50d6e323147eee8e780c0e77b63b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Krasimir Balchev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
