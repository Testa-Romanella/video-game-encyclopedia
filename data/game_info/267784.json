Its simplicity stands to imply its complexity in terms to what it can do with just a handful of game play aspects and it utilises them to their fullest capabilities. The PC version is very tempting. The amount of game play time it offers is amazing once you get the hang of the game. The music is by far the most addictive part of the game. Even if you lose motivation to play more for the time being, you'll just hit the level again just to listen to the music.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of game you\u2019re going to pass off to your friends and say, 'You\u2019ve gotta check this out.' It\u2019s dangerously addictive.<br/><br/>This game knows exactly what type of game it wants to be and executes on it spectacularly. Merciless difficulty meets brilliant design.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7c/b7cf2951656c198f4373035a1d76c316.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["macgamedev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
