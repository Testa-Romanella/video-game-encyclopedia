The game itself is worked on solely by alblank, each segment handcrafted and shaped through countless hours of experience with RPG games. Blight does not rely on heavy exposition, cutscenes or tedium in its gameplay, rather, the game attempts to encourage the player to seek their own path through exploration and character interaction. The choices you do or do not make, the areas you do or do not visit, the characters you do or do not meet, all is up to the player and their curiosity.</p>\n<p>While being set up as a traditional RPG using a traditional RPG engine, Blight attempts to circumvent and correct common pitfalls within the genre.</p>\n<p>Blight retains a traditional RPG turn based battle system, tweaked and refined to be engaging, non-repetitive and satisfying. The game will utilize timed hits for both basic offensive attacks as well as\u00a0defense. Combat skills and abilities are used strategically in battle, governed by a traditional MP/TP system for magic and skills respectively. These abilities are held by and\u00a0acquired through a character's equipment. Simply using the equipment in battle will allow the character to permanently learn the ability it carries by defeating enemies and\u00a0gaining LP.</p>\n<p>Enemies are planned to be represented on screen during exploration, eliminating random encounters. Many areas are devoid of enemies entirely, and serve to provide context, lore and puzzles, subverting the need to engage the player in combat in order to progress.</p>\n<p>The game's story is told through character dialogue, small sequences and set pieces driven by the progress of the player.\u00a0 However, certain aspects of the story are revealed\u00a0by engaging the player to peel\u00a0away at layers uncovered through exploration.</p>\n<p>Optional areas, side quests and vignettes abound for the curious.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:49:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f89/f89d3b23fae0adb050c10c4665b5caed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alblank"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
