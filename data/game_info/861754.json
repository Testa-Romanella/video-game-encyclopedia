Use the arrow keys to move the paddle and bounce the ball into the overwhelmed bots and get rid of them once and for all. Each bot is 5 points, hearts are 15 points, and snowmen are 1 point. Remember to avoid letting the ball touch the floor! If you get distracted, GAME OVER!! Destroy all the bots and characters and WIN!! \u00a0Twist: I decided to add a GameOver and Win panel when the ball hits the floor and when the ball destroys all the bricks. I also decided to make the different character blocks different points.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T09:00:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ce/2ce9281e714a5bdb4feacd7a35112c97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mmaguilar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
