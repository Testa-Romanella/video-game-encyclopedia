Here you will be able to fight in multiplayer or single-player with controller support\u00a0as you go through, shooting asteroids, enemies, and even a boss while you are\u00a0trying to be be promoted over your other friends. Collect power-ups, points, and fuel as you fight your grueling way through. This is an early-access beta build with many more features to come. Be sure to visit my YouTube, Redstone Engine, and leave any constructive criticism and / or suggestions there. I thank you for reading this and hope you give it a try! Also, if I do spot any videos on YouTube with this game that has more than 1,000 views, I will discount this game for a limited 24 hours after the finding of that video. This money will primarily go towards the creation of more amazing games and I thank you for any contribution. A charity live stream may also be on the lookout on my channel at a later date.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:55:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b586d4156090c00193cf8de537cc6200.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedstoneEngine"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
