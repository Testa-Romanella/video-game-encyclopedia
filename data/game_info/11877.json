An exclusive power let him do that once a round for a few sec.<br/> </li></ul><br/>- Fire rate of 10.5 shots/second and per player (up to 200 simultaneous trajectories).<br/>- Official layouts of all international leagues (NXL, Millennium, PALS, CXBL, UWL, SARPL) before the IRL events for training purpose.<br/>- Scenario map SC Village.<br/>- Progressive low latency servers deployment in USA then in Europe first. <br/><br/>To learn more about the game, please read our Guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938763797<br/><br/>To chat with the team (we have to dev a game, so we are not 24/24 on it ;-): https://discord.gg/mTHTAcTWhat is coming next in matter of days/weeks? - On the first line: Gameplay improvement until community satisfaction.<br/>- Continuous bug fixing.<br/>- Server browser (real time multiplayer) : Play 5v5 with friends on your favorite maps.- LAN.<br/>- New animation set.<br/>- New maps and layouts.What is coming next? - Competitive mode.<br/>- Team management.<br/>- Field Configurator.<br/>- Other community whishes ;-)Why did we make a paintball videogame? Paintball is an amazing sport, offering intense competition and strong team experiences. On the surface it may appear to be a straightforward shooting game, but it is not\u2014strategy is essential for success. Your team\u2019s strategy, tactics and coordination may not be obvious at first sight but make all the difference between mindless shooting and truly playing the sport of paintball.<br/><br/>There are two more ingredients that make our paintball game unique. The first is realistic ballistics and the second is the maps, or layouts, designed by pros for competitions. The quality of those layouts relies on their real life \u201clevel design\u201d that makes them suitable for international competition. We don\u2019t forget the fun of playing on scenario maps with friends where strategy and tactics are also essential.<br/><br/>The XField Paintball Studio Team wants to create a new video game experience, based on the most realistic and immersive simulation possible of the sport of paintball, including features that reveal the depth and natural gameplay of this sport. The game is developed with pro players to address both the paintball community and the PC player without paintball experience.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, we want to create the Official Paintball Video Game, based on:<br/><ul><li>\tA fully immersive technical and design environment.<br/></li><li>\tGameplay based on team strategy, tactics and communication.<br/></li><li>\tAnd a strong, community-driven update plan.</li></ul>The TeamXField Paintball 3 is a small team, devoted to the development of the game. We have now 2 devs and 2 designers, 3 of theme are part time-teachers in a video game school. <br/>XFP3 is powered by one of their creations, a custom designed FPS-Sport multiplayer hybrid engine and a new concept of gameplay. <br/>We are four others to regularly contribute to the project, in communication or marketing (website, Facebook, store, Discord, mailing, press, \u2026) or to go to meet the community at many paintball events, to find partners. Two of us are highly invested in the paintball community for many years, like Gael Chauvet in the media or Loic Voulot (Tonton captain or National Technical Director of the Paintball French Federation).<br/>And Rachel who helps us a lot for accounting and legal points.<br/>Most of us have part time job outside of the studio to make this project possible. We also had some support of pro animator or young devs. We want to thank them! We hope to be able to have them in the team again.<br/>We also thank all those who help the project, like CS Paintball, leagues or brands.<br/><br/>Our expectation is to create a new and exciting paintball experience on PC, for paintball fans first, and maybe tomorrow to contribute to the paintball promotion out of its community.<br/>Thank you for your support and your contribution to XField Paintball Studio.<br/>Help us share our passion for the game.<br/><br/>The XFP3 Team.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/4919568a5168a30ff6e673584bd2ca03.jpg", "website": "http://www.xfield-paintball.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XField Paintball SAS"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["XField Paintball SAS"], "esrb_rating": null}
