The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards by placing them with like-colored cards in descending or ascending order from the number 11. Other cards can be placed after the 11 card of a color is played. The order the players enter the lobby decides their turn order. Each player has to play a card when it\u2019s their turn if they have a playable card. Otherwise they draw from the deck until they find a playable card. A player can draw 3 times to find a playable card after the 3rd card if the player has no playable cards they must end their turn. Lastly, when a player has zero cards in their hand they must end their turn to win and end the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T07:41:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726b45ec8931876d16e051aa8a630e85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["dara6996"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
