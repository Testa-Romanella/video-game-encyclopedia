It was developed during my PhD research into designing games for collecting human-subject data.</p><p>The source code is available at https://github.com/davidgundry/PilotGame<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong> The game was originally built for web using the Unity Plugin. Unity has now switched to building to WebGL, which does not provide access to the microphone. While there are workarounds I have not gone back to implement these. Microphone access has been disabled to allow the game to be demonstrated.</p>\r\nResearch Background\r\n<p>This game was created as part of my research into eliciting human-subject data using games. It was part of research into getting players to speak to games. As such, the core mechanic of the game is controlled by the user's microphone input. A syllable detection algorithm is used to identify speech.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T20:10:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b1e956781482339f57ee30996bd47e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["davidgundry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
