This game aims to reproduce that effect (either to your advantage, or to make things harder) by combining the classic mechanics of Asteroids with 2D orbits.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>- Move around with arrows or W, A, S, D</p>\n<p>- Fire with Enter/Space/Z (also used to restart after a Game Over)</p>\n<p><strong>Triple #Trijam Themes:</strong></p>\n<p>\"Novel Twist on Classic Game\" and\u00a0\"Chain Reaction\".</p>\n<p><strong>Diversifiers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Make a game that can be understood regardless of what language the player speaks!</p>\n<p>[others pending for the next two builds...]</p>\n<p><em>Note: some of the code and formulas\u00a0handling orbital mechanics was pre-existing for a past prototype of mine.
