Our little team - me and my son, who came from Ukraine and now live near this magical city. That is why our game uses two important diversification - Hidden Heritage and Slava Ukraini. And about the game. Water comes and feeds roots that grow and threaten to engulf the entire city. You need to gather something to access the next weapon that can destroy the more powerful roots. When there\u2019s too much water and you can drown, you have a way out, find it. Come on, root out it, enjoy the fabulous Cambridge and look for Easter eggs. The game uses a shader that does pencil graphics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T23:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/814b011da0e1553317fd186bbf9fc647.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alyx Sable"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
