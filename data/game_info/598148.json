You are a spellsword named Mina, and you battle the forces of evil with magic and sword combined! You have been called upon to face the evil Wizard Garrick, who has held Aur in his sinister grip. This is Magic Quest!</p>\n<p>And if you're reminded of Dragon Quest, that's because the game is a bit similar...that is to say a lot similar...what I mean is...virtually identical. The sprites are a bit better. All graphics are made by me, as is the music. This game encompasses the best of Dragon Quest, gets rid of (some of) the worst aspects (You can save anywhere, if you do, you ARE saved by the Queen, but you don't lose half of your money! Eh? Eh?).</p>\n<p>Also, the lead is a female protagonist, this time! And there is more story in this game, although, it follows almost all of the beats of its principle inspiration.</p>\n<p>I set out to make a game that reminds me of Dragon Quest. It was my first RPG and it was high time I made an homage to it. Here it is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:44:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b26ee669102d73701bd3f7728eafe2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pianotm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
