We're sorry Gawr Gura</p>\n\n<p>This was made for the weekly game jam\u00a0WEEK 243 with the theme \"boulder\" and us at Tygur had our first thought be crushing people with them which is funny I think.<br/><br/>No, the rest of the menu buttons dont work, I dont have time to make them<br/><br/></p><p>by the way the lovely background ukulele music was shamelessly ripped of by this video\u00a0</p>the original is Gawr Gura's BGM but this is specifically the video i downloaded it from", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:09:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1bf5c0a24e5208c35591af39247a580.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TyGur"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
