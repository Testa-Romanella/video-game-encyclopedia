I only had less than a month to work on it, but might add more later. Currently 8 levels, a boss, and secret level. First file is the zip the other two are the include files, I also just added HTML because some people don't like downloading. The game UI may be cropped\u00a0depending on the size of your device. I've only used Godot\u00a0for 2 months so I wasn't sure how to fix this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:18:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b1136e269a3255ba6a19176b8827c244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Mushy Potato"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
