A simple cardboard box turns into a spaceship, the floor you stand on turns to lava, but sometimes, people go into that same imaginary world to escape their problems, no matter how old you are.</p>\n<p>Based on an alternate version of our first successfully-backed game, Transhaping, in Pixel Planet, you are in that imaginary world to escape your parents. Jump over enemies, solve puzzles and do much more in this fun and exciting mini-game collection!</p>\n<p>The game is inspired by well-known video game, WarioWare. We want the game to have that retro feel but also put a twist on the party game/ mini-game genre.<br/><br/>You can back the Kickstarter and find out more at:\u00a0</p>\n<p>tinyurl.com/pixelplanetkickstarter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dda/dda94d803a4d6600f8c98b7585e1966a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unbound Interactive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
