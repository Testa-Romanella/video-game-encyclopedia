For this, firstly, we must produce bread from the wheat we harvest.<br/></p>\n<p>Watch out! if the worms get too hungry, they will start to get angry. And that means the end of the game. You\u00a0have to feed them constantly.<br/></p>\n<p>Besides, you're not the only one who needs wheat. Slimes also consume wheat as food. That's why you must drive them out of your field. But don't be afraid. they won't hurt you. All they want is some food.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:33:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaeb1ca8313330ac4ca5992085a6bddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Roalinn"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
