In a process of renegotiating truths, collage and glitch become key tools in the confrontation of our digital/cosmic corporeality.</p>\n<p>This work comes as a visual and physical companion to Stefana Fratila's study of Earth and research undertaken at NASA, nested within her ongoing project <strong><em>I want to leave this Earth behind</em></strong><em>\u2014</em> which includes 8 open-source VSTs that emulate the atmospheric conditions of the planets within our solar system. The project is conceptual, in that it centers on outer space exploration and Stefana's understanding of 'Crip futures'. Her vision for the work is to engage audiences in an exercise of imagining the sounds of interplanetary atmospheres\u2013 conditions which are inherently unlivable, unbreathable, thus converting all human body-minds into disabled-bodied-ness</p>\n<p>Extend this reality with an atmospheric redolence made by perfumer Courtney Rafuse of Universal Flowering - available via dlvdm.ca</p>\n<p><strong><em>A Boundless and Radiant Aura </em></strong>was made with support from SpekWork, Lennard Spokowinsky &amp; Sarah Cannon.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em>.\u00b8,\u00a4\u00b0\u00b4</em></strong></em></strong></p>\n<p>A \"Magic Window\" allows users to experience the 360\u00b0 viewpoint without a VR headset, but instead through a monoscopic viewpoint into a 3D scene, which changes according to an orientation sensor or user prompt.
