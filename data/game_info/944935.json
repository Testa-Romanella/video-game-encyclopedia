It has a day and night cycle.<br/><br/>Night time is the time to get things done. One survivor is selected to venture out into the world to scavenge. The others stay at home resting or working to build stations at their home (stations, such as workshops and bedrooms, provide benefits to the community). After the player assigns jobs, the player selects a location from the main map for the lone survivor to visit. The player must use the survivor to scavenge for resources before daylight returns. While scavenging, the player can find building materials for stations, weapons, clothes/armor and other items such as lock-picks.<br/><br/>At night, normal zombies are usually slow but they can still hurt the survivor if the player is not careful. Throughout the scavenging phase there is the possibility of Events. Events are periods in the night cycle during which the sky turns red and normal zombies become ferocious and alert.<br/><br/>Day time is the time to stay at home. Survivors can either rest or guard the base to protect against possible zombie attacks.<br/><br/>Some Game Features to Note:<br/>1. Survivors have (light) backstories revealed by their \"Journal Entries\"<br/>2. Survivors have statuses (Injury, Fatigue, Hunger, Sickness)<br/>3. Survivors have traits (e.g. speed)<br/>4. Survivors can equip body armor, shoes, and weapons<br/>5. A trading system<h3>Story:</h3><br/><br/><br/>Imagine that one morning half of the population suddenly and mysteriously disappears. A few later hours later, the sun starts going through \"reddening cycles\". Over the course of a few weeks, more and more people start to spontaneously turn into zombies. All civilizations fall apart. All that remains are the ruins of past world and those few who didn\u2019t turn into zombies, Those Left Behind. They must fight to survive. They must scavenge during the night and stay out of sight during the day. Lead a group of survivors and build a home. How long can they survive this nightmare?
