The development, however, took much longer than 3 hours. It took approximately 9 hours to make the game, including all assets.<br/><br/>I am quite happy with the outcome so far, though there are many things to improve upon, without a doubt.<br/><br/>I hope that you will enjoy this negative space rendition of a classic!<br/></p>\n<p>=== TOOLS USED ===</p>\n<p>The game is developed using Godot v3.2 Mono.<br/>The art is drawn using Aseprite.<br/>The music is made using Beepbox.<br/>The sound effect is made using Bfxr.<br/></p>\n<p>=== FUTURE TO DO ===<br/><br/>&gt; Make the rotations environment-sensitive (e.g. allowing some (now not allowed) rotations next to a game border, by shifting the piece)<br/>&gt; Add a soundtrack that is not thrown together in 5 minutes... and put some effort into mixing and mastering it.<br/>&gt; Revisit the visuals (hopefully without sacrificing readability): Add very tiny animations for visual flair and give the whole thing a whoppin' dose of retro style.<br/>&gt; Add a game menu and restart mechanics.<br/>&gt; Add an AI opponent<br/><br/>&gt; Any suggestions are welcome!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T04:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724374726b241bc7bff7d9a1fd3b14bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["7ko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
