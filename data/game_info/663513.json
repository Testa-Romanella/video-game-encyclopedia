Being born and raised in an environment where being gay is considered as a sin and completely unaccepted by the society. As the topic of sexuality is a big taboo in the Middle East and there are laws against LGBTQ people, it\u2019s extremely challenging to explore or even talk about it.\r\n</p>\n<p>Personally, I was extremely lucky to be raised within a family that deeply loves me and is very supportive of me. However, despite that the lack of awareness concerning this topic made the struggle even harder for me. For a whole 22 years, I was completely unaware or subconsciously hiding and running away from this part of me. The extreme aggression towards gay people in the Egyptian community became embedded internally inside of me leading to confusion, frustration, and lack of self-love (compassion).\r\n</p>\n<p>The last 3 years of my life, I have been trying to dig deeper in this topic and try to find a way to myself: try to see myself from my own eyes (hear my own voice without all the external noise). I was surrounded by people who were trying to help me in different ways, however, it was in ways that satisfied their projections of me. I lost my closest two friends because of this journey of exploring my sexuality and it all goes back to the lack of awareness as well as the absence of a platform where understanding oneself is not condemned.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>The Subconscious Realm:\u00a0</strong>a mixed experience (based on creative coding \u2014 audio visual interactive experience that tries to tackle the internal subconscious struggle (Mixed Media).
