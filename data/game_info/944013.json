{"id": 944013, "slug": "dropbeat-2", "name": "Drop.Beat", "name_original": "Drop.Beat", "description": "<p><strong><em>Drop.Beat </em></strong>is a genre fusion of <strong>puzzle matching</strong> and <strong>rhythm driven</strong> games, with a unique neon-visualizer aesthetic that draws you into the beat of the track. Match up diamonds of the same type and shoot for a high score!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Drop.Beat </em></strong>is a celebration of the wonderful mediums of <strong>video games</strong> and <strong>music</strong>. Experience\u00a0your new favorite songs in an <em>entirely different way</em>!</p>\n<p>Each music track is given ample care through its very own <strong>background visualizer</strong>, <strong>patterned\u00a0</strong><strong>randomization</strong> of blocks and <strong>tailored rhythm events</strong>. Tracks may feature challenging increases\u00a0in tempo and block drop rate, followed by short pauses for a chance to breathe. Aside from\u00a0gameplay changes, tempo events may change or introduce new elements in the visualizer as well.</p>\n<p>This\u00a0<strong>proof of concept demo\u00a0</strong>has previously been featured at a couple of online game development contests. It is now available for all to try out! Do keep in mind that development is <em>not currently ongoing</em>. I'd still love to hear people's thoughts on this game and any support is very much appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum System Requirements</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>OS</strong>\r\nWindows 10 or higher\r\n<strong>Processor</strong>\r\nDual Core 1,5 GHz or faster\r\n<strong>Memory</strong>\r\n2048 MB or more\r\n<strong>Graphics</strong>\r\nDirectX 11 Compatible w/ 512 MB video memory or higher<strong>Screen Resolution\r\n</strong>1280x720 resolution minimum\r\n<strong>Storage</strong>\r\n110 MB or more\r\n<strong>Sound Card\r\n</strong>Required, headphones recommended<strong>Control</strong>\r\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse and/or Gamepad\u00a0(XBOX Controller recommended)\r\n<p><strong>Content warnings:</strong>\u00a0Photosensitive; slight flashing lights and effects warning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Featured Music: Mercury by Shane Ivers - https://www.silvermansound.com<br/>Mercury \u00a9 2016\u00a0by\u00a0Shane Ivers\u00a0is licensed under\u00a0CC BY 4.0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T06:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/982/98238cc9b7aeb8668e3c0e27c707482e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Perpetual Diversion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
