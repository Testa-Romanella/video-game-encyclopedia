In order to be prepared, you can invent technology that allows you to predict such future events.<br/><br/>Help Mims survive the numerous perils of the galaxy in their bid to reach their final destination!<br/><br/><br/></p>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVIEWS\r\n<p>Video game news outlets had this to say on 2 years old beta demo - bear in mind that the game underwent dramatic development since then:</p>\n<p><em>\"The gameplay so far feels pretty solid, and is very much in line with what you\u2019d expect from a city builder.The Mims Beginning is on Greenlight and could use some love. Head on over and give it a thumbs up !\"</em><br/><br/><br/><em>\"...it looks like a fairly deep, personality rich god game revival. Given that good god games are in woefully short supply these days, we should probably count our blessings here.\"</em><br/><br/><br/><em>\"The Mims: Beginning has become the latest indie hopeful to head down the crowd-funding route, popping up on Indiegogo. And it\u2019s a bit of a looker, putting many so-called \u201cAAA\u201d games to shame with a visual style which brings to mind titles as diverse as Spore and Black &amp; White.\"</em><br/><br/><br/><em>\"Everything in a game has been crafted in a gorgeous way. From creature to building, you will find the Mims to be one of the best indie games of the year 2014. \"</em><br/></p>\n\n\n\r\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\r\n<strong>MINIMUM WINDOWS:</strong><br/>OS:\u00a0Windows XP or later<br/>\r\nProcessor:\u00a03.0Ghz dual core CPU<br/>\r\nMemory:\u00a04 GB RAM<br/>\r\nGraphics:\u00a0Geforce 8800GT / ATI Radeon HD 4850<br/>\r\nDirectX:\u00a0Version 9.0c<br/>\r\nStorage:\u00a02 GB available space<strong>MINIMUM LINUX:</strong><br/>OS:\u00a0Ubuntu 10.10 or later<br/>\r\nProcessor:\u00a03.0Ghz dual core CPU<br/>\r\nMemory:\u00a04 GB RAM<br/>\r\nGraphics:\u00a0Geforce 8800GT / ATI Radeon HD 4850<br/>\r\nStorage:\u00a02 GB available space<strong>MINIMUM MAC:</strong><br/>OS:\u00a0OSX 10.6 or higher<br/>\r\nProcessor:\u00a0;3.0Ghz dual core CPU<br/>\r\nMemory:\u00a04 GB RAM<br/>\r\nGraphics:\u00a0Geforce 8800GT / ATI Radeon HD 4850<br/>\r\nStorage:\u00a02 GB available space", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/6585385128d5bc7911c0576586059583.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 563, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The End of The Sun Game Team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
