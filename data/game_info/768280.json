You're the player with the red sweater.<br/><br/>These are the rules: <br/>- while you hold the microphone your flow goes down<br/>- if your flow reaches zero, you're out<br/>- if you keep the microphone long enough it gets on fire<br/>- while the mic is on fire, any receiving player will have to spend the same amount of flow that the previous player did before throwing the microphone again. If the player fails to do so it takes flow damage equal to half of the aforementioned amount<br/>- if you hit a modifier while throwing the microphone you get that bonus<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:32:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7b/f7b438ef9d133120548b9869bcf0602e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ntreese", "Phanelly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
