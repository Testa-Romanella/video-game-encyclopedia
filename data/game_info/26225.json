You can make \n      chains to receive additional points or to make a game more difficult for \n      an opponent. When you destroy spheres in a Multi-player mode, they will \n      be added to the opponent\u2019s board making his task more difficult. On a \n      board you can find special bonuses like a Brush, a Rocket Launcher or a \n      Bomb which can be used to destroy spheres or to paint a line of them \n      with the same color. Try also variety of modes (Arcade, Survival, Brain \n      Breaker, Player vs CPU) for a single player and the unique Multi-player \n      mode played on one Nintendo DSi system!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce9/ce9a0f2ea3d0aed72580e07693160298.jpg", "website": "http://www.teyon.com/games/ball-fighter-dsiware/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Teyon"], "esrb_rating": null}
