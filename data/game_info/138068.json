This is my Ludum Dare 32 compo entry and it's my first time participating in the Ludum Dare, aside from Mini LD 58. It's was really fun doing this and will probably join future Ludum Dares. <br/><br/>This Game is about a guy who uses green and blue guns to make it through a unknown world. It's a 2D platformer (points for originality). <br/><br/>Controls: W, A, S and D for movement. Left and right mouse buttons for the color guns.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/13619871fea19b3fda96d98b56db99ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jacob Eriksson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
