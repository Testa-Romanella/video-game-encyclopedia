{"id": 711553, "slug": "they-shall-not-pass", "name": "They Shall Not Pass", "name_original": "They Shall Not Pass", "description": "<p>\"They shall not pass!\" is a game where you play as PeterBert, the border patrol agent. Your job is to discover suspicious packages going through the airport. You've only worked at the airport for about a week so your experience is limited but performance expectations are high. You have your intuition and an x-ray machine at your disposal. But since your machine overheats easily, you cannot scan every package. Your goal is to find the suspicious packages or risk losing your job if too many get by you.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Use your mouse to click on one of 3 buttons:</p>\n<p>Green - to pass the package</p>\n<p>Red - to reject the package</p>\n<p>Yellow - to scan the package and see what's inside</p>\n<p>You have a limited number of scan attempts and bad packages you are allowed to miss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/60963a4aea7057e138f5f7bd15ff2db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vironika", "erdnusskopf", "pmfduch", "ntreese"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
