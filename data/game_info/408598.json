Press any keyboard key or click with the mouse.</p>\n<p>My submission to the NOKIA 3310 JAM 2. The challenge was to create a game which could conceivably run on a classic NOKIA 3310 with the theme \"Death Is Good\".<br/></p>\n<p>I decided to take a recent popular mobile game and imagine how it would look if ported to the old 3310. The game I picked was Flappy Bird. In accordance with the theme I wondered <em>\"How can I make death a good thing in Flappy Bird?\"</em>. My idea: Instead of flying through randomly generated gaps, why not make your gaps yourself - by repeatedly flying into brick walls and dying! Each time you die, the game gets a bit easier, because there is now a bigger gap in the location where you died.</p>\n<p>How often do you need to die to get through all 8 brick walls?</p><p><strong>Development info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to create this game I wanted to use something other than Unity for once. So I made this as a WebAssemby module programmed in Rust.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The whole game is just 559 KB zipped, and 536 KB of that is the cellphone jpg i got from Wikipedia.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>By the way, the sounds are not pre-recorded samples. They are actually synthesized in real-time through the HTML5 Audio API. Take a sawtooth wave, run it through a really aggressive highpass filter and you got a sound which is pretty similar to the monophonic speaker of the 3310.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T03:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43c/43c7b9b6a2ce86b7785cdabfbe7f38ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PhilippTheProgrammer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
