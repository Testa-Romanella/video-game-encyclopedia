Boasting a ton of content to explore and everything you could've ever wanted from one of these games, I'll tell you what.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this game took way longer to finish than I initially thought. I was planning on getting this out during the month of\u00a0Scoobtober, but went the extra mile and added double the maps and enemies, since it\u00a0felt pretty lackluster and unfinished. Glad to finally have this project done, it was something I had in the backburner for a few years, but I'm pretty proud with how it turned out.
