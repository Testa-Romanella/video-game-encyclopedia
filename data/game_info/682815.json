Loads", "description": "<p>You can play the game in game mode, or offline with friends at your computer.<br/>\njust to give you an idea of how epic this is. Please watch the trailer!\n\nOnce you've started the game, you'll be dealing with the introduction of Mgbt, the new mayor of the city (pretty sure you'll be the one staying behind to chase dudes out of the city).\n\nThe world of the game is about to be shattered by a huge explosion (to be specific, the world will have been fully broken into smaller parts that are falling apart.)\n\nThe game's director, Tom Byarow, explained it such, \"the world will be totally blown apart, from the middle of the city to the down world. And I always wanted to render the city pieces in this way, because it seems as if everything is falling apart. I guess it's like a broken clock's - you know, it's waiting for that moment.\n\n\"And the person that's kind of like the Mayor, look, I'm well aware that some big things will happen to him, but also I want to make sure that the gameplay is really strategic and you're using this new way of thinking to make a sort of tactical decision.\"\n\nThanks, TF2DB.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T10:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7f2ac32178b0764f6bd14bf686bda1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
