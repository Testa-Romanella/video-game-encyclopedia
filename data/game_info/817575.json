Silent Hill, where you explore a looping \"L-shaped\" hallway, however, the main purpose was to develop a game with high-fidelity graphics, while trying to maintain good performance and optimization.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game's narrative was intended to be an anthology (i.e. The Dark Pictures Anthology) but due to the deadline of this project, along with the writing of the thesis, the narrative, some game mechanics, and level designs, among others, were cast aside to focus on the main core of the game.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are some bugs/glitches that were left unfixed:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>In the Display Settings menu, attempting to change the resolution will cause the aspect ratio to change, making it unfit to play the game. It is recommended to leave the default resolution (1080p);\r\n</li><li>In gameplay, upon reaching the top of the stairs, if you are unable to move forward, lean over to the left. This is caused by the messy colliders that were placed on the stairs and unfortunately, the time was not on our side to rebuild it;\r\n</li><li>When changing the options in the Display Settings menu, they are saved as registry keys on Windows, however, during gameplay, those options are back to default. You can switch them back to your liking in the Pause Menu.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>THIS GAME WAS DEVELOPED ON A MACHINE WITH THE FOLLOWING\u00a0SPECS**:</strong></p>\n<p>CPU:\u00a0 Intel i7-7700HQ @ 2.8GHz\u00a0</p>\n<p>GPU: Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti 4GB VRAM</p>\n<p>RAM: 16 GB;</p>\n<p>** These specs are informative only! They do not specify the minimum nor the recommended requirements to play the game. On the build version, the FPS of the game consisted of 50-70 FPS with V-Sync disabled and with the Preset set as Medium\u00a0\u00a0Quality.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, thank you for checking out this game!
