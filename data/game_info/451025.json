We wanted to say a few things about this project before you hopefully download and give it a few plays.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game took roughly two weeks to accomplish. In terms of platformers it isn't anything groundbreaking and you aren't going to see it on any top 10 games lists of 2020. The primary purpose of this project was to actually finish a game within a set amount of time, similar to a game jam. Something aspiring game developers and indies struggle with universally.</p>\n<p>We also learnt so much from this project - working as a dev team, game and level design and before this project pixel art, animation and making music were fairly foreign to us. (So please go easy on us in that department). We've made a few mistakes with this project too but they're all things we'll take into future projects and will only make us better developers.</p>\n<p>Once again, thank you all for playing!</p>\n<p>Wez &amp; Tom - DoubleTom Games</p>\n<strong>Contact &amp; Links</strong>\n<p>Twitter</p>\n<p>Facebook</p>\n<p>YouTube</p>\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 Update\r\n<p>Hello fellow Slimers!</p>\n<p>This was always intended to be a short project purely as a learning experience in game development and to actually create a finished product. We've been surprised by the interest in the game so far, thank you to everyone that has downloaded, played, donated and left constructive feedback. With this we decided it was only right to add some of these features that you wanted. Uninstall the previous version of Slime Lad on your machine and download and install the new version 1.1 file.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for your support, Wez &amp; Tom - DoubleTom Games</p>\n<p><strong>Added:</strong><br/>- Timer added to end game stats screen.
