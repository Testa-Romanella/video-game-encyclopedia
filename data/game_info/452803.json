It should help make the later levels more complex.<br/></p></li>\n<li><strong>I made a new sprite-sheet</strong><p>I remade all of the sprites. I'm not sure the new sprite are better, but i felt that they had to be different from the old sprites.<br/>So this time, the sprites are 32x32 instead of 16x16, so they have a little more detail.<br/>I also added small dots to each of the colored blocks, so colorblind players\r\n    can also play the game.</p></li>\n<li><strong>I added 25 levels</strong><p>I added 25 new levels, so there in total are 45 levels.<br/>Most of the new levels are a lot harder than the old, so now it is a bigger challenge to complete the whole game.<br/>I really wanted there to be 50 levels, but unfortunately i didn't have time for the last 5...</p></li>\n<li><strong>I made a new menu</strong><p>I made a whole new menu, as the old one was confusing and players had a hard time figuring out how to start a new game.<br/>So I stuck with a basic menu with buttons.</p></li>\n<li><strong>I made a new song</strong><p>I used the last few days of the jam to make another song, so now there are 2 songs.<br/>I really wanted there to be even more songs, but like with the last 5 levels, I didn't have time for it.</p></li></ul>\r\nI hope you injoy the game!<br/>Thank you for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T02:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/790/7901660e22fcee973ca7be2644bd26e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Spicy Overlord"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
