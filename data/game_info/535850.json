Can you wield it and downgrade it to safe standards?<br/><br/>Navigate using a/d for horizontal movement and w or space to jump. Slide down walls, jump around, and try to avoid destroying everything with your unwieldy shovel as you gather resources to make a better - I mean, worse one.</p>\n<p>Your first shovel will destroy everything it touches as it follows your mouse. Later shovels will only destroy things you click on.<br/><br/><em>The music in the game is made by James Hammond!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:55:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15d71d26598edadc564dfaee8ab180d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["River Forge Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
