{"id": 407885, "slug": "bunnypac", "name": "BunnyPac", "name_original": "BunnyPac", "description": "<p>Based on the original arcade game Pac Man, that was developed by Namco in 1980. It was originally a 2D single player maze game. You played as Pac Man and had to avoid the Ghosts while trying to collect all the pellets and fruit scattered around the maze. Collecting the power up pellets allowed you to turn on the ghosts and eat them.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\tIn our remake of this classic we made it 3d, added a Norse-ish theme and replaced PacMan with a Viking Bunny, while the Ghosts are replaced with Snakes. The snakes representing the World Snake from norse mythology. The rest of the game is nearly identical to the original in play style and hashed out 2 levels for people to enjoy. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe2ed83f49745eb29372b879abf3c51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToastieRuin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
