All of a sudden, siren went off everywhere at the army base Fort Gordon, in the state of Georgia. In the blink of an eye, special force commando, Hecho Blaerion, found himself looking for major covers from a sky full of B-57 bombers. Hecho spotted an empty cave by the side of the mountain. He knew he had to dash for it even at the cost of risking being blown up into pieces on the way. He made it. At least he thought he made it. Next thing he knew, the shock wave from bombs all around him tossed him up in the air and rendered him unconscious. When he woke up, he found himself in a totally different time and space that he couldn\u2019t even use any words to describe. Speechless. He was presented with a menu and a gun. When he stepped on a blue square, a sign whacked him in the face. He fainted. A couple hours later, he woke up again. This time he was extra careful. The sign told him to shoot something. Suddenly, he was on a platform with ships circling around him.  There was one way into this bizarre realm.  There has to be one way out only, he figured.  The way was to JOIN THE FIGHT with all his guts, a Chinese made magical shield and a laser gun he called the \u201cSinistram\u201d.  Can he battle his way out of 30 ships, or be blasted to pieces?  There is only one way to find out\u2026...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a6/1a620f41130eacda5d94f49d5e96b8ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hin Lam"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BubbleFish Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
