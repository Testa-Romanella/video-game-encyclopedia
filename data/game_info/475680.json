I didn't have much time to make this game so it is slightly rushed.</p>\n<p>The idea of this game is to move a character (the circle) around a map. You must sneak past enemies and collect all of the spinning diamond things. There is a puzzle element to the game, as you can see where the enemies are going to move. The game is slightly unfinished, with only 15 levels, and I'm sure some glitches as well.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, you must move along the dotted path, and so you cannot move from this.</p>\n<p>You can also use WASD to move.</p>\n<p>GAME ENGINE</p>\n<p>This game was made in the Construct 3 game engine. It was made solely by PinballJunior.</p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>Download the Windows version to play on desktop. Unzip the download and double click the \"Sneaky.exe\" file to run. No installation needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T04:40:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a3/1a389893fe39faf267b65d3b3ca8c48b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PinballJunior"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
