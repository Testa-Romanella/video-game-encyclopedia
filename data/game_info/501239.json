The house is a mess, you can hardly remember the night before, let alone your name.\u00a0You have been found out, the cartel knows you have been making deals with the law. This minute just seems to be getting dragged out longer and longer. Is this even your house?</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move around, and E to interact with your environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>LMB to shoot.</p>\n<p>This is a randomly generated top-down puzzle game, except that death does not mean that everything is reset. Sure, your progress is lost, but you still have the knowledge of your previous life. In fact, it seems as though there is no other choice other than to keep pushing forward, this loop seems forced upon you, it's like you are trapped. *wink* Use this opportunity to escape this bleak scenario.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game I threw together in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 47, \"Stuck in a loop\" compo. It's not perfect, but at least it is functional, mostly. If the notes don't display all of the safe digits then I'd refresh the browser and restart, I ran out of time to fix it, most of the time they work okay though. If you played this, thank you! And congrats to everyone else who took part in LD47 as well, this was my first time in this gamejam and it was good fun.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T04:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/120/120368d6348d0da9e0f32e8c9710722d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SqueedFingars"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
