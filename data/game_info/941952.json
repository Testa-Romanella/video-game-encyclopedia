The 3D levels in this game are generated on the fly from 2D maps from the RPG. Creating new levels is easy since it just uses EUO's 2d map editor.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is pretty short: you should be able to speed run it in about 30 mins - times to beat are provided.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T12:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/544/54471aff8d1bd0f65737155159d4216e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eggmceye"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
