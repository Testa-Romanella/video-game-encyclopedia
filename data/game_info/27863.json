Retro Quantum Industries (RQI) has invented the next \n      wave of transportation. Forget autonomous vehicles, these scientists \n      invented teleportation! Unfortunately, even 2139's technologically \n      advanced citizens are terrified to have their bodies teleported through \n      time and space. After spending billions of dollars on R&amp;D, the company \n      cannot afford commercial failure.\n    </p><p>\n      The solution is Swap Fire! A high stakes game show, featuring teenage \n      contestants utilizing RQI's teleportation technology. Sales and usage of \n      consumer grade personal teleporters spiked after the first season of \n      Swap Fire, in which Justin Agitprop was crowned as the Swap Fire \n      Valedictorian. Now, it's time for season two. The fans are eager and the \n      executives at RQI are more so!\n    </p><p>\n      Be ever mindful of your spacetime!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a93/a9342fc4caea16a1f5cd148870237a4a.jpg", "website": "http://swapfire.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii U"], "developers": ["Midnight Status"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Midnight Status"], "esrb_rating": null}
