I think we can all agree, flying controls that jam in only one direction are so much more thrilling. Add lightning and various other mechanical problems\u2026now you\u2019ve got a game! <br/><br/>Jammed Controls is all about flying your damaged plane with a series of loops. Loops and more loops! Get struck by lightning and watch your controls get jammed the opposite direction. This is a one button retro-style game that will test your reflexes and strategy skills. Solve each level by navigating around a multitude of flying and floating obstacles with carefully timed loops. Only the most skilled pilots will arrive safely at the airport to the great relief of motion-sick passengers. The game is quick to learn, but difficult to master. <br/><br/>Developed by NationLocation Games, makers of the wildly popular web game City Jumper\u2122 in collaboration with Radical Retro Games.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5aa/5aa68fd4c9f2f2b741a6709040324c9b_2he4evw.jpg", "website": "http://www.jammedcontrols.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Eric LaBadie"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Eric  LaBadie"], "esrb_rating": null}
