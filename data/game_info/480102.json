{"id": 480102, "slug": "what-a-card", "name": "What a Card!", "name_original": "What a Card!", "description": "<p><strong>What a Card!</strong>\u00a0is a series of card-based microgames featuring 50+* different game modes. It was\u00a0made for the LOWREZJAM, a jam where you have to make a game in\u00a064x64 pixels or less. See how many levels you can beat before the increasing difficulty proves too much for you.</p>\n<p>This game is played entirely using the mouse. Just start the game and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0had fun with LOWREZJAM last year\u00a0(with a very different pace and tone), and this time I\u00a0decided I'd also limit myself to a restricted palette as well, which is why you'll see things like dithered fades instead of using transparency.</p>\r\nTired of losing?\r\n<p>Try forever mode, where there's no game overs and the difficulty adjusts to you.</p>\r\nA game mode giving you trouble?\r\n<p>No problem! Try it out by itself in practice mode and come back to the main mode ready to show it what for.</p>\r\nWant to see it unscaled?\r\n<p>Change the scale multiplier down to 1 in the options menu or by using -/+ on your keyboard. Due to engine limitations, this will not center it vertically. My apologies.</p>\r\nEnjoy this? Try some of my similar games:\r\n<ul><li>Tap It!: Using mouse or touch controls, try to keep up with the on-screen commands.</li><li>Type It!+: Try to keep up with the on-screen words.</li><li>The Appeasement of Cyclus:\u00a0Dodge enemies while trying to collect enough apples to appease the god of cycles.</li></ul>\n<p>* Similar to how game collections you'd find in the budget area of a store would advertise 100+ games.\u00a0 As in, a good deal of them are very similar. If you were going by distinct game types, it's more like 10. This small print is only for entertainment value, and its presence is intended as a joke.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T04:05:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13a/13a00ee824cedae393e8cde7e294ebb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
