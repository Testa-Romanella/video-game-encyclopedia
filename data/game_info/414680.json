{"id": 414680, "slug": "eggidemic", "name": "Eggidemic", "name_original": "Eggidemic", "description": "<p>A deadly plague is threatening eggs all over the world. You can save the healthy eggs by keeping them away from the infected ones.<br/></p>\n<p>The plague is not the only threat to eggs, Willowblade eats eggs for breakfast. But perhaps he too can play a role in keeping the plague under control.</p>\n<p>Eggidemic is created for the Godot Wild Jam #18 by Shoe Fisher Games. As you can clearly see we did not think, at any point of the jam, that the theme was eggs! :) Once the plague theme was announced we used assets (that we certainly did *not* create while thinking the theme was eggs) to come up with this interesting and fun game.</p><p><strong>Wildcard</strong>: take a chance on me. Your luck determines which eggs drop, whether they are sick and where they drop.</p><p><strong>Willowcard</strong>: Features Willowegg.<br/></p>\n<p>Nico and Gertjan form Shoe Fisher Games, we are indie developers from the Netherlands who create a little game called WanderOut in our spare time.</p>\n<p>If you like this game, let us know by rating it, commenting on it, or by following us on Twitter or Facebook. If we get lots of positive feedback we might continue to make this into a fully featured Android/iOS game.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Created using the excellent Godot engine.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T04:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/694743f50053043ac1c671149352c882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShoeFisherGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
