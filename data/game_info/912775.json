Clearly, I remembered it poorly but it serves as a prototype and learning experience in my journey into Game Development. Please enjoy the game. Comment if you like it and if you would like to see a much bigger game with similar mechanics. I would love to hear feedback on the feel of the game and anything you liked or disliked.\u00a0\u00a0And tell everyone your High Score. Mine is 10,700.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You move with the arrows or WASD. Aim your turret with Q and E. And enemies become harder as you progress. Good luck!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ef/6ef6199b936ec18eb38e8fa96610258c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TAbandija"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
