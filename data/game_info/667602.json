It will strike the other ball that sits on the sliding rail and also hit the domino after dropped to the ground. There will be two paths from here:</p>\n<p>a)\u00a0 After going down from sliding rail, the striked\u00a0ball will go through a tilted maze and hit a series of dominos.</p>\n<p>b) The hit\u00a0deminos are designed to have increasing heights so that they will trigger another ball sitting on a high flat cube. The ball will go down a series of small planes like stairs and be collected by a rising conveyor belt. Going out from conveyor belt, the ball will activate another ball on the top of a slide that extends out of the plane. The ball will go down the slide and make another ball go down the slide. The other ball will come back to the plane and hit a series of dominos.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:27:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be2/be213ab17841ad8e64e5d6c2a972dd76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LujieZ"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
