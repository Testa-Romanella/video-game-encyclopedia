Synthematic is a One-Man Project out of Welland which makes sound design, sound related releases and software. The project began in 2011 with Synthetic Illusion blogspot. The years went by and I began to wonder about stuff like VST's made with Synthedit and Maize.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Maize based software is the default gui which is no big deal since it is one sample set based off a Xhun Audio LittleOne preset I programmed in 2016. I used extreme sample converter to sample the vst then used the sfz to make the sampled based maize plugin in AU and VST for Mac Users and VST x86, x64 for VSTi Plugins on the Windows platforms.<br/></p>\n<p>The\u00a0principle\u00a0sound\u00a0was\u00a0modeled after New Order's Blue Monday, using a Moog Phatty VST to emulate a Moog Source. The Little One preset is available online somewhere for Synthetic Illusion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T10:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f70/f70ac821740f560a4bc5118bfa0393a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joel Bisson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
