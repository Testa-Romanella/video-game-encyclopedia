A webcam is recommended.</strong></p><p>In this day and age, information and what you do with it is power. Inspired by a dystopian cyberpunk future, Exposed is a 1st person competitive breakout game created by three collaborators - Michael Consoli, Caroline Sinders and Adelle Lin.</p><p>Players can enter their names at the start of the game. Two players are playing against each other but are restricted from seeing each other's faces. A glowing orb bounces back and forth as the players raise their hands to protect their tiles, which are their safety barriers. As each tile explodes upon impact, the players begin to uncover their opponent's visual identity.</p><p>Our identities are embedded within the information we share in cyberspace, often placing us in vulnerable positions depending on the persistence of our opponents and the fragile security promised by the Internet. </p><p>This is a fast-paced game, players play vigorously and whoever wins stays protected, with the loser's defenses breached and their information exposed.</p><p>Team:<br/></p><p> Michael Consoli http://www.michaelpconsoli.com/</p><p>Caroline Sinders http://caroline-sinders.squarespace.com/</p><p>Adelle Lin http://adelle.ninja/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e1ccce7a23c2803c34cc53348aa672.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["adellelin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
