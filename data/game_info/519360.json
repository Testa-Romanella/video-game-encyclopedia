Following her disappearance, communities rallied together using social media in search of her followed by protestations\u00a0 to denounce Gender Based Violence, mostly towards Women. After 6 months of her disappearance, her family received an announymous text message informing him that his daughter was buried in a grave kilometres away from the town. He later informed the Namibia Police who went to dig out the remains. Two days later, a couple boyfriend was arrested in connection to that murder. <br/></p>\n\n<p>GAMEPLAY:</p>\n\n<p>As a player incarnating three different characters (i1, i2, i3) in one same story, you can be invited to change the fate of each of them (through indices or checkpoints), and in particular the fate of the character we call\u00a0 'Victime'.<br/>The characters are 'Victime', 'Culprit' and 'Police officer'</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7d/d7de0cca9a56164056a63ab2fb379af2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jchiledred", "Chubo Zeko", "ThatDeadDude", "saintevalentine", "Ntokozo", "Princess Netshakhuma"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
