Remember to eventually <strong>fall back</strong> with the help of the <strong>compass</strong> before it's too late. Reorganise, recover and <strong>set back out</strong>.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Watch your Sanity</strong>: the game features many <strong>unique audiovisual feedbacks</strong> the lower the <strong>character's sanity</strong> gets. Remember: not everything is always what it seems as friends may seem foes, your vision might worsen, some voices may echo in your head, and more.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Plan and Manage</strong>: study new areas and <strong>plan your approach</strong> to get through them; <strong>manage resources</strong> within a limited inventory space; <strong>consume and equip items</strong>, at a cost, to increase your chances at getting through the journey; <strong>control your lantern</strong>, in order to obtain the best results in terms of fuel consumption, sanity soothing and discoverability.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Perform Rituals</strong>: <strong>craft items</strong> by executing rituals, thanks to the <strong>Book of Knowledge</strong> located in the Base Camp, which always <strong>favours insanity</strong>: the lesser the sanity, the bigger the reward will be.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Survive with your Friends</strong>: up to <strong>4 concurrent players online</strong>. Share resources, attract enemies to assist your weaker fellows and use lanterns to help each other orient and finally escape together... if you're bold enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> (mouse+keyboard only<strong>)</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD \u2192 Move\r\n  </li><li>SHIFT \u2192 Run\r\n  </li><li>SPACEBAR \u2192 Climb\r\n  </li><li>LCTRL \u2192 Crouch\r\n  </li><li>E \u2192 Interact\r\n  </li><li>F \u2192 Lantern On/Off</li></ul><p><strong>TEAM DI SVILUPPO</strong></p><p><strong>Game Designer</strong></p><p>Andrea Marchetti (Project Manager)<br/>Thomas Del Prete (Lead)<br/>Lorenzo Viscomi<br/>Luca Ghisio<br/>Lorenzo Danese</p><p><strong>Game Programmer</strong></p><p>Andrea Mastroianni (Lead)<br/>Andre Francavilla<br/>Gabriele Ventrice</p><p><strong>Concept Artist</strong></p><p>Jay Magara (Lead)<br/>Andrea Stendardi</p><p><strong>Game Artist 3D</strong></p><p>Cristian Mazzei (Lead)<br/>Marco Di Gristina<br/>Gianfranco De Virgilio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:00:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf6/cf6e9b6dc3ed61392a5b36c2b7f50e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Bros Game Academy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
