The game puts the player in the perspective in front of a friendly, yet mischievous cockatiel in which they are tasked with petting,\u00a0 feeding and training him (feature coming later in development). When the cockatiel is interacted with, various emotions will be expressed by the cockatiel with his body language, crest (when the crest is down, he is relaxed. When it is up, he is alert) and eyes (e.g. when the cockatiel is happy, his eyes will slightly squint). The choice is up to the player depending on how they want to treat the cockatiel \u2013 they can choose however they interact with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In different situations caused by the player, the cockatiel will react like a real bird (e.g. if you don\u2019t interact with him for a minute, he will relax and get tired). The game does not have a main objective, but the player does have to keep the cockatiel happy and healthy to get the best player experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>[FEATURE COMING SOON]</em></strong>\u00a0When training him, he can learn multiple songs that he whistles.
