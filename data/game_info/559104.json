The difficulty is to get to the finish line. Your transport reacts to irregularities on the surface. Sometimes you have to drive carefully, and sometimes accelerate to jump over a pit or obstacle. There are several types of transport available, for example, a motorcycle is more maneuverable, unlike a regular car. Monster trucks are better at overcoming bumps on the surface. Do not forget that during the jumps, you can change the slope of the transport. This will allow you not to roll over when landing.<br/><br/><strong>Game Features:</strong><br/><ul><li> Good physics implementation<br/></li><li> Nice and simple visuals<br/></li><li> Several different vehicles available<br/></li><li> Steam achievements<br/></li><li> Family friendly</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T03:58:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/369/369246d83f7121791c450b4650dd2404.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rex Junior"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rex Junior"], "esrb_rating": null}
