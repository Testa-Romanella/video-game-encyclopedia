{"id": 50734, "slug": "shadows-die-twice", "name": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice", "name_original": "Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice", "description": "<p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a game about a ninja (or shinobi, as they call it), who is seeking revenge in the Sengoku era Japan.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the 16th century in a fictionalized version of Japan. The main protagonist is a member of a shinobi clan. A samurai from the rival Ashina clan captured the protagonist&#39;s master, and the protagonist himself lost his arm trying to protect his leader. However, a sculptor of Buddha statues managed to replace the lost limb with an advanced prosthetic arm. The protagonist accepted a new name, Sekiro, meaning \u201cone-armed wolf\u201d. Now his goal is to avenge his clan and to save his leader from the hands of their enemies.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Sekiro from the third person view and navigates the character as he fights multiple enemies. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice features an innovative combat system that doesn&#39;t use hit points. Instead, the opponents can be killed with a single precision strike. However, the player has to fight his or her way through the opponent&#39;s blocks and parries to land the deadly blow. The main character fights with his sword (katana) in the right hand, while his left hand can host a variety of upgrades, such as an ax, a torch, or a shield. The game also emphasizes stealth action. The player has to use a grappling hook to access multiple locations. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has no multiplayer.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2019-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/67f/67f62d1f062a6164f57575e0604ee9f6.jpg", "website": "http://www.sekirothegame.com", "rating": 4.38, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 535, "owned": 3713, "beaten": 1303, "toplay": 1223, "dropped": 634, "playing": 313}, "playtime": 15, "achievements_count": 77, "ratings_count": 1966, "suggestions_count": 526, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 2000, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["FromSoftware"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Activison", "FromSoftware", "Activision Value Publishing", "\u65b9\u5757\u6e38\u620f"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
