Here's the idea:</p>\n<ul><li>Delve into a dungeon filled with monsters, clearing each floor to reach the next.</li><li>When you reach the end, create\u00a0<em>your own\u00a0</em>monsters for others to fight - or for your next romp through the dungeon.</li></ul>\n<p>For a 48-hour jam, I had to massively scope my original ideas down, but I'm excited about the future of this project:</p>\n<ul><li>Leave a copy of yourself for others to fight.</li><li>Have your own identity (name) and power up monsters you created.</li><li>Modify the dungeon decor in addition to monsters.</li><li>Permanently destroy monsters to gain clout or extra power.</li><li>Use your monsters to fight other monsters.</li></ul>\n<p>This proof of concept shows one small aspect, but it's the seedling of a living, breathing dungeon where\u00a0<strong>you\u00a0</strong>create the world. Please enjoy! All feedback is welcome. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Linux and OS X versions are untested but should work.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f410b85619a741aad12f2e622608ea9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Joshua McLean"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
