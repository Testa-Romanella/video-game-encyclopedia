Lufia, the Mario &amp; Luigi series, Final Fantasy, and even modern indie takes on the genre such as Undertale and Lisa. Turn-based battles, a ton of recruitable characters, and a personal story to sink your teeth into: Viola has all of this and more. However, Viola is not a passive RPG. Attacks require the player to time their button taps, and to unleash spells you'll have to follow a series of rhythm game-esque inputs.<br/></p>\n\n<p>On top of being an RPG, Viola: The Heroine's Melody is a side-scrolling platformer! With wall jumps and triple jumps, springs and cannons, you can explore each level and uncover every little secret. Find more potions, or gems to equip and customize each character's stats! And don't worry about random encounters: each monster is visible in the level. Don't feel like fighting? Just jump around and find another path!</p>\n\n<p>Music is key to Viola: The Heroine's Melody. Every character in your party has their own instrument, and they'll eagerly play along with the songs you learn along your journey. All the songs have their own magical effect, like summoning a bird, creating a magical campfire, unlocking secret pathways... If you've ever played a Zelda game, you'll feel right at home.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Viola: The Heroine's Melody is about Viola's journey. It's one of strange characters, powerful monsters, fantastical locations and plenty of laughs. But Viola's journey isn't just about going home: it's also about learning. That it's okay not to be perfect. That it's okay to grieve. That you deserve love, and that sometimes that love starts with learning to love yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Many people are unable to see themselves in the things they watch, read or play. Viola: The Heroine's Melody is filled with characters of all kinds: different colors, different loves, different ideals. If you've ever felt out of place, and like you couldn't connect with the characters you've seen before, Viola is for you.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa507511db1d650f70c94e8f228976e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jelle van Doorne"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
