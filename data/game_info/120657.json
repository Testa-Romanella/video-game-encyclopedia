The switch will turn off automatically over time but will turn back on if supplied power.</p>\n<p>You can build pylons which, when turned on, will store charge in any connected batteries and also turn on anything it is connected to.</p>\n<p>The more batteries you have, the more monsters will spawn. If you have no batteries then the monsters will leave you alone, giving you some breathing room to build up your circuit.</p>\n<p>Turrets, when turned on, will search for and destroy any attacking monsters who are looking to destroy your batteries.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Left Mouse -- Interact</li><li>Middle Mouse Drag/ WASD -- Move The Camera</li><li>Scroll -- Zoom In/Out</li><li>Right Mouse -- Make Connections</li></ul>\r\nConnections:\r\n<ul><li>You can connect any component to any other component!
