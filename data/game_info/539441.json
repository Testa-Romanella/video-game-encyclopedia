Click to rotate the pipes so that all the pipes are connected. The correct solution will never contain a closed loop.<br/></p>\n<p>Left click to rotate clockwise, right click to rotate counter-clockwise. Tap G to toggle a grid, which some may find helpful. <br/></p>\n<p>The non-wrap puzzles are significantly easier than the ones that wrap, as the pieces along the perimeter can be deduced in non-wrap puzzles. That's a good starting point for solving them.<br/></p>\n<p>The puzzles are randomly generated every time. The generation is done with a modified implementation of Wilson's algorithm.</p>\n<p>Created in 4 days as a personal jam project. The core concept isn't original, I've seen a few versions over the years, and I think the mechanic has been in a few board games I've played. Not sure. There is a particular flash game from my childhood that I suppose always stuck in my head. Well, flash is dead and I have no hope of remembering or finding that old game. So I made my own version for fun. It was PuzzleTeamClub's more recent release that made me remember the old game and think about how I might generate the puzzles myself ... and here we are.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:14:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e064252a7e3adb6f01a9b2279f113c23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hunter Dyar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
