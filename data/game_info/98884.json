He wanders off but soon finds out that an old acquaintance is back - with a desire for revenge! </p><p>Kittey travels to the other end of the island, soars through the skies, raids pyramids and even stumbles into a really silly and dangerous dimension! Good grief! He'd better make sure his sugar level isn't too low.</p><p>This game's development was weird! It was made in AS3/Flash, runs at 30 FPS and runs on multiple platforms - browsers too. This is the first time I'm actually using proper code to put out a game, and it shows. The game isn't super impressive graphically, but hey - gotta start ~real~ coding somewhere, right?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23cc54a2d110f15230864fc6b34070fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["origamihero"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
