Further completion through the puzzles provides you with more keys (both senses of the word), as well as chords (both senses of the word), that can be shot at various enemies before reaching your final concert. Beware, some doors and enemies may require you to be in a certain key before proceeding (bottom right once unlocked).</p>\n<p>This project was made for the first Game Maker's Toolkit 48 Hour Game Jam\u00a0using the Unity Engine, Blender for modeling, and Bosca Ceoil for the sounds/music. Putting the project together was Cassidy Noble.</p>\n<p>Knowing this was a game jam, this is not a polished final version of the game. Time may have slipped away from me doing the player modeling so it is the default capsule (sorry about that!), but the deeper your progress in, the more complex the artwork and puzzles become. :) </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy! I\u00a0would be thrilled with any feedback you would like to provide!\u00a0:) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bd/0bd65a7f375b8581c25069a9477f13d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cnoble"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
