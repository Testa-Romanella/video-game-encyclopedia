I teamed up with Pit and Barely Even Games in making this game for 72 hours.</p>\n<p>In this game, you are a bean trying to escape the facility. However, there is an AI who is stopping you. He'll put obstacles along the way, such as platforms, spikes, turrets, even saws. And even if you die, you'll just be respawned back to the entrance. Can you escape the facility even with you'll die a lot? Or will you just BEAN UP?!</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>I worked on the programming and designing the main menu<br/>Pit helped with polishing several arts that I have made to look better<br/>Barely Even Games made some music and sound effects<br/>The fonts that I used are from Kenney's Asset Store, which is free and licensed CC0.</p><p>EDIT: I made a google form to know more about the level design.
