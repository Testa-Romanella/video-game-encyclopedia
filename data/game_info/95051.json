Therefore there ARE some sub-pixel movements happening with certain GUI elements. But the game, itself, runs pixel perfect in 64x64.</p><p>Playing with a XBOX 360 gamepad is *Strongly* recommended, but just in case the game defaults to keyboard control which works just as well if it detects no controllers connected.</p><p>Feel free to get in touch if there are any questions! :) Twitterhandles are below.<br/><br/> - ODS</p><p>!!!!PLEASE NOTE!!!!:</p><p>The titlescreen tells you to \"press 'a' button\". It wrongfully assumes that you've got a xbox 360 gamepad connected in which case 'a' button makes sense. But on keyboard the button to press is 'k', since that maps to the same action used.</p><p>Controls on Keyboard are WASD and UIOJK.<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/><br/>Peter (aka PEET) (@peter_karp):<br/>- Programming<br/>- Art<br/>- Sound design<br/>- Music<br/>- \"Writing\"<br/>- Design<br/><br/>Bag (@bagthebag)<br/>- Design<br/>- Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a33/a33c63f42aa5b11eadbb63ba8dd55763.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ODS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
