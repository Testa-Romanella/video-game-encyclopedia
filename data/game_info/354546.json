Strap yourself in, sit behind the wheel of a dune buggy and start your adventure now!<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>\u25b6 13 UNIQUE CARS: Dune buggy, food truck, circus truck and more!<br/>\u25b6 MULTIPLE EXCITING CHALLENGES: Pass all of the missions in style!<br/>\u25b6 FREE ROAMING MODE: Explore the area at your own pace<br/>\u25b6 REALISTIC TRAFFIC: Find your rhythm around narrow, overcrowded passes<br/>\u25b6 BEAUTIFUL OUTDOOR LOCATION: Climb uphill roads, drift on sandy beaches<br/>\u25b6 CONTROLS: Buttons, Wheel, Tilt &amp; MFi Game Controller Support<br/><br/>Start your driving adventure on a beautiful island! When you feel warmed up, mix things up and hop into a sports car, quad bike or even a massive bus. This is a racing game that will bring the sun into your life! Drive through narrow mountain roads, drift across sandy beaches and venture offroad as you try to beat your high score. Become the fastest driver around, but remember \u2013 when you\u2019re so close to the sky, even one mistake can be fatal!<br/><br/>The game features a wide and varied selection of cars. You start out in a fast and maneuverable dune buggy, but during the course of the game you will also drive bigger and more demanding vehicles (a food truck will not be the biggest of your problems!). By the time you reach a whole circus truck, you should be well enough versed in the intricacies of the gameplay to effectively react to every surprise the tracks may throw at you!<br/><br/>Narrow mountain roads are problematic in and of themselves, even without the traffic. Well, we\u2019ve got traffic too, so be prepared to turn your driving skills up to 11! Not only you will have to overtake vehicles left on the side of the road. You will also have to find your rhythm around narrow, overcrowded passess, where even a small mistake may end up being fatal.<br/><br/>You will drive around a tropical island where the mountains meet the sea. Regardless of where you take your car you can be sure the view will be worth it!<br/><br/>The Main Game Mode is 100% FREE to play, all the way through, no strings attached! Extra Game Modes which alter the rules slightly to make the game easier are available through optional In-App Purchases.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T20:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c8420590e674134327c07ee6afbb14a_kPGamLF.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Play With Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Play With Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
