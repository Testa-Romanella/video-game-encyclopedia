The color scheme must change both the paint and upholstery colors in a harmonious (but not identical) fashion while preserving surface details such as rust and wear. A full RGB spectrum should be possible.</li><li>A decal system which allows the player to optionally add one of 4 different \u201ctattoo\u201d sets to further customize appearance.\u00a0</li><li>A car ornament system which allows the player to optionally add one of 4 different ornaments (hood scoops and spoilers in this case). These should also use the custom surface shader.</li><li>An on-screen GUI with buttons and sliders to control customization.</li><li>The final car should be able to export from the \u201cBuild Your Car\u201d scene into the \u201cRace!\u201d scene.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b5ebe52598b8231e8649c7523bdc4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["IndigoSane"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
