Players will take the role of a tourist in Japan who finds themselves in a bizarre situation as they got dragged into the past and woke up in a dark-lit shrine where they need to solve puzzles and fight monsters on their way to escape the nightmare they are in.</p>\n<p><em>Gamedev's note: Please bear in mind that\u00a0<strong>this game is still in development</strong>, thus some bugs are still to be expected. The Settings and the enemies\u00a0aren't yet functional in this build. There are still more mechanics to be implemented and the current level is bound for changes.\u00a0However,\u00a0you can still try it and explore the map, find the keys, grab the treasure and escape the shrine. <br/><br/>We\u00a0are game design students and this is our very first game. We would love to read your reactions comments and suggestions. :)<br/><br/></em>To see more info about the team and some concept arts, link\u00a0to the press kit:\u00a0Presskit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T19:33:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bacb0c56e8f808f0f723f0036dad22a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Studio Crying Spider"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
