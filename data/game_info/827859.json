It has simple fighting mechanics but I'm planning on updating it whenever possible!</p>\n<p>You can play it without downloading here:<br/></p>\n<p>https://trinket.io/python3/31ae4d62fa?outputOnly=true&amp;runOption=run</p>\n<p>If you want to look at the code you can find a direct link to the pastebin: https://pastebin.com/3Jnm85Am</p>\n\n<p>Currently each character is randomly selected from a list of characters, but its possible to pick a character to use.</p>\n<p>There are other gamemodes - such as pvp (both characters are controlled and 2 humans can play against eachother), pvc (the current selected mode where its against a computer), cvc (computers against eachother), story\u00a0(currently WIP, where players gain levels and improve their character)</p>\n\n<p>It's very messy but it works! You can edit the base Chi that characters start with, knockout amounts, variences in attacks, costs, chances of defending. I tried to make changing things as easy as I could for myself for balancing reasons.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of things are in flux - such as Chi costs or chances of hitting.</p>\n<p>Moves:</p>\n<p>Attack 1 - Basic attack that if successful, removes 1 Chi</p>\n<p>Attack 2 - A stronger attack but exhausts the user more than the basic attack. Higher chances of hitting</p>\n<p>Attack 3 - A special attack, uses a lot of chi but will have special effects based on who uses it</p>\n<p>Defend - Chance to defend the next attack</p>\n<p>Charge - Charges Chi and increase user's speed by focusing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T14:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47d02224493bf209e737140750fbdfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nightooo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
