But why is a mystery to you. You feel like you have to see every nook and cranny. What's worse, you don't even remember how you got here. You can see your car, but you didn't drive it. It's like you weren't you until now, or someone was controlling you. This amounts sensation will remain with you until the end. You will try to find the answers. You will search. You will run. You will scream. You will die. AND I WILL WATCH YOU DOING IT ALL ALL OVER AGAIN!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed by</p>\n<p>Crirex<br/>DanyBv<br/>Vlad1111</p>\n<p>Art by</p>\n<p>Vlad1111</p>\n<p>Level Design by</p>\n<p>Vlad1111</p>\n<p>Lightning by</p>\n<p>Crirex</p>\n<p>Audio by</p>\n<p>170084 (from Freesound.org)<br/>yottasounds (from Freesound.org)</p>\n<p>Made in Unity for GMTK Game Jam 2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f1/8f1cd1de296e4ec31b03f6657ebd453b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vlad1111"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
