It is a first person puzzle-platformer centered around a world shifting mechanic, allowing you to shift between two paralell realms to solve puzzles and navigate obstacles.\u00a0 This is the game as we turned it in, but eventually I do plan to continue working on it and continue iterating on the Idea. We are proud of what we made, and learned a lot through seeing how much of this project had to be trimmed or cut down to make the deadline.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T09:54:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4f/a4fb78bde88427fbb807c14eaf6434ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MippyGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
