The player will experience phenomena such as ocean acidification, coral bleaching, ghost nets, and dead zones to see how each harmfully affects both the reef and its inhabitants. Through our educational narrative and various collectibles, we aim to educate players about the dire situation in our marine ecosystems. 11 Years intends to both contribute to the climate change dialogue as well as convey the experiences wildlife animals have to endure because of human impact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls (PC &amp; PS4):</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D (Joystick Btn 10)\u00a0- Rotation</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button (Joystick Btn 4)\u00a0- Forward</p>\n<p>'Enter' Btn - Boost</p>\n<p>Keyboard Btn 'E' - Eat</p>\n\n<p>~A Gameheads team. \u00a0(H202)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/591/591907457c6819f40c14aa926046b14f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameheads"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
