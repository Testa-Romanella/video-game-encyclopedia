With the storytelling of a novel, the player choice of an RPG, and the dice roll mechanics of a tabletop game, the game creates a unique experience that changes with every playthrough.\u00a0Create and customize your character, improve your skills, and\u00a0navigate hundreds of branching choices as you journey through the magical city of Velantis.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is currently in development. It releases episodically on a chapter-by-chapter basis.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wayfarer </em>rated M for fantasy violence, depictions of blood and gore,\u00a0explicit language,\u00a0sexually suggestive themes, and drug and alcohol use.

Their Order, once a powerful presence in the world, is broken, leaving behind only a handful of warriors still bound by their creed.</p>\n<p>When your mercenary work backs you into a corner, you take the only option available and accept a contract: to travel to the city of Velantis and steal an ancient artifact said to be blessed by the gods.\u00a0Simple, right?<br/><br/>But Velantis holds more than you bargained for. Gathering a ragtag party of malcontents and renegades from across the city, you must navigate enemy factions, meddling guilds, and escalating political tensions. Your choices will ultimately determine the city\u2019s fate \u2013 and the fate of every person who lives there.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Create a fully customizable protagonist, selecting:<ul><li>Gender (male, female, and nonbinary options)</li><li>Pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them or create a custom pronoun set)</li><li>Name, including aliases and nicknames</li><li>Ancestry (choose from 5 species\u2014humans, dwarves, elves, Melusine and Aeda)</li><li>Origin (choose from 6 different backgrounds)</li><li>Appearance (including complexion, hair, eye colour, height, tattoos and scars)</li></ul></li><li>Upgrade 4 skills which will determine your successes and failures.
