It was based on an idea my friend threw at me. The point of the game is to complete a maze by going through different coloured and shaped gates. The colour and shape of your character dictate which parts of the map are open to you, and pads are scattered around the map to change your shape and/or colour.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e06/e060e74ecb5e05d72b72d657a2c6fe5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Xand"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
