We were tasked with creating a 3D vehicle game and the theme I went with was sci-fi as I came to like this theme quite a bit. I began with the usual research and planning to get the ideas going for this projetct. Next, I learnt the basics of 3D modelling using 3DS Max as this was my first time doing so. The only assets I made were a planned out vehicle (DeLorean) and a facade which was very rushed and didn't offer much resemblence to what I was going for and the rest of the assets were all from online sources. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Positives: <br/></p>\n<p>With this being my introduction to modelling, I think I did a pretty good job at creating a vehicle that mostly looked like what I was going for. The shape and texture matched my reference for the most part. I also expanded into doing more programming, this time searching up new mechanics online and implementing it in my game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Negatives: <br/>My car could have had more detail in both the geometry and texture side of things. The mesh was quite blocky which kinda fit the style of the DeLorean but could have been better. The texture also was quite messy; for instance, the windows were painted on with Photoshop. The final thing for the art work was that I didn't make many assets myself and rather took a lot of them from places online which made too much of a blend between different themes and styles. Lastly, even though I expanded with my programming, it was still pretty basic and didn't challenge my skills much as I only took the scripts and applied them to things rather than modify them.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Evaluation: <br/></p>\n<p>This project went quite well and really helped me branch out my skills and experience in games development. It served as a good introduction to 3D development where I managed to get the jist of things quite fast and then built that knowledge up to allow me to push myself in what I was capable of doing. The one issue that stood out to me was that this project got very messy in terms of management and organizing things which impacted my workflow.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Stats:\r\n</p>\n<p>Lines of code: approximately 860<br/></p>\n<p>How enjoyable was development of this project: 8/10\r\n</p>\n<p>How much I learnt throughout this project: 7/10\r\n</p>\n<p>Difficulty of this project: 5/10\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:58:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c867da7cff0fedebc5a490e48740e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0xDaniooo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
