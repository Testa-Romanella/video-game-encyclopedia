If you haven't played that mod yet, I recommend you play it first. Baldi's Fun New School\u00a0Remastered has a total of 8 modes, which are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Exploration Mode:\u00a0</strong>Explore Around Without Baldi Chasing You!</li><li><strong>Story Mode:\u00a0</strong>Get All 7 Notebooks And Escape To Win!</li><li><strong>Endless Mode:\u00a0</strong>Try Collecting As Many Notebooks As Possible Before Baldi Gets You!</li><li><strong>Timed Mode:\u00a0</strong>Collect All The Notebooks And Escape In A Limited Amount Of Time!</li><li><strong>Upside Down Mode:\u00a0</strong>Get All The Notebooks And Escape While Everything's Upside Down!</li><li><strong>Camping Mode:\u00a0</strong>Go Camping With Baldi And Keep The Fires Going!</li><li><strong>Bossfight Mode:\u00a0</strong>The Spinner Boss Has Returned For Round 2! Try And Defeat Him!</li><li><strong>And Discussion Area:\u00a0</strong>Chat And Have Discussions With Other Players Online!</li></ul>\n<p>There's also <strong><em>secrets</em></strong> that can be found, like <strong><em>codes</em></strong> and <strong><em>hidden areas</em></strong>. Some of the codes return from Baldi's Fun New School, while others are entirely new and cause interesting\u00a0things to happen.
