As they progress through the levels, players will face increasingly difficult challenges that will test their construction skills and strategic thinking. With a blend of wacky, brain-teasing gameplay, and creative powers, this game is sure to delight players of all ages and skill levels.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T02:58:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edf8de02991ea9427c997f1eda98205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dincicode"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dincicode"], "esrb_rating": null}
