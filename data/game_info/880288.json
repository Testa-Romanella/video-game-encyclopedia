Due to the controls, this game feels impossible, similarly to Getting over It with Bennet Foddy. You have to move your mouse cursor around the screen so your character will follow you. There's even an easy mode option that's almost even harder so much so, to the point where I had to put a star next to the word easy. This game is fun, only if you let it be. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T09:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/72582a329de485b7865623c762a0f071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["R1gsby"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
