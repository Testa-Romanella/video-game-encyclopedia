Who knows.*</em></p>\r\nPITCH\r\n<p>Hello, My Name Is Nobody is a party for the people who doesn\u2019t like parties. A conversational game about those moments when you want to be alone surrounded by people. Doubts, desires and anxieties will flow through an innovative dialog system that features interruptions, changes of mind and more little mechanics, building the main core of the experience: organic and fluid conversations about everything and nothing. Welcome to The Rose of Jericho Lounge Bar, do you wanna talk?</p>\r\nMOOD PROTOTYPE\r\n<p>HMNIN began as a little concept after the release of The Fall of Lazarus in october 2017. Born from the roughest moments of game dev loneliness it was an experiment looking for a single innovative and compelling gameplay mechanic that allowed the team to get creative without overscoping the project. Inspired by how theater works where people come and go in a single place and the scenary and actors change during the play the project started with the idea of a conversation with a stranger in a bar and kept evolving from there. Hello, My Name Is Nobody started shaping into a narrative driven experience where dialogs would be the main core f the game and the only way of interaction in the game, allowing the player to focus on the conversation flow.<br/></p>\n<p>Now we are releasing the prototype we showed at EGX Rezzed 2018. Goichi Suda yelled \u00abSUGOI!\u00bb when he saw our HMNIN stand, and that made all of it worth the effort.\u00a0Hope you like it, drinks are on the house!</p>\r\nPLANNED FEATURES\r\n<ul><li>Innovative and organic dialog system with interruptions, changes of mind and more.</li><li>Customizable character from a variety of masks, jackets and colors.</li><li>Branching conversations about everything and nothing including silence as an option of dialogue.</li><li>Multiple endings driven by little choices.</li><li>Psychedelic and unique setting and graphics that creates a chill and introspective mood for chatting.</li></ul>\r\nTHE SOUNDS OF THE ROSE OF JERICHO LOUNGE BAR\r\n\n<p><em>*Cover art by johnny.JPG based and inspired by Gorillaz and their album Demon Days.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>HELLO, MY NAME IS NOBODY: NEON DAYS - INSTRUMENTALS\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>The Brodevhood x 5inapsi5</em></p>\n<p>Neon Days - Instrumentals is an experimental album where 5inapsi5 in collaboration with us\u00a0explored a wide variety of sounds in order to set the mood of The Rose of Jericho Lounge Bar, the fictional pub where the to-be-developed video game Hello, My Name Is Nobody is set up. In this collaboration with the indie video game developers The Brodevhood we tried to channel the mood of the concept \"being alone surronded by people\" taking inspiration from Baladamenti and Vangelis to trap and urban music going through bands like Gorillaz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4a1c5c080072afda46b7b31a2a5206b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nazhor", "The Brodevhood", "johnny.JPG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
