In this game you can \r\nonly move by dive kicking.  I ran out of time to implement enemies, but \r\nthe dual purpose would be attack and movement.  The dive kick button is \r\nthe same as the jump button as well.</p>\n<p>Press Left or Right to face left or right on the ground.  Press \r\neither of the X or O buttons (Z, X on keyboard) to Jump from the ground.\r\n  While in the air, press the same button to dive kick.</p>\n<p>Thanks to @MBoffin on the pico8 BBS and twitter for the use of the code for the camera movement!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6e/f6ef72b8ce881b17ec37742b48fc4317.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["o.banksii"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
