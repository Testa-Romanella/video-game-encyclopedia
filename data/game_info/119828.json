I could go back to pick up the undone processes after beating the game, but I didn't. As there's no motivation for me to do the same experience again.</p>\n<p>So I created a game which you don't need extra time for those tedious processes.<br/>Embrace the imperfections,relax and enjoy the perfection of simplicity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16a/16a31c80e7800f1850242aeaed9f412d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Archefelys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
