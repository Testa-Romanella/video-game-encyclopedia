It was heavily inspired by the Super Famicom game \"Little Magic\", but I\u00a0was frustrated with the real-time elements of that game and wanted to make a turn-based version that better allowed for careful planning.</p>\n<p>This game has 30 levels of increasing difficulty, and should take quite a while to finish! It's probably too big for a PuzzleScript game, since they lack a way for players to go back to levels. I'll likely make future games shorter or split them up into episodes.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nMove/RotateArrow Keys or WASDCreate or Inflate Bubbles (when available)X or C or Spacebar or\u00a0Enter<br/>UndoZ or URestartRMute SoundsM\r\n<p>The game should automatically save your progress in your browser's local storage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb5/cb5682ba73d5c3867b0221c527e7b6d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gate"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
