IF YOU OR A RELATIVE SHOW RISK OF HAVING EPILEPTIC SIEZURES, RUN AWAY!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA twin-stick shooter where nothing has a defined color! Fly around the arena blasting away colorful enemies in 8 modes! Break your high-score!<br/>\r\nFeeling cramped? Some modes give you the bomb ability, which wipes the screen clean without negatively impacting you.<br/>\r\nAlso, try using the dash mechanic to your advantage to rapidly reposition yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeadline - you get 5 minutes with an infinite amount of lives. Death can still hinder you and break your odds of beating your best score.<br/>\r\nMortality- the typical arcade experience.<br/>\r\nPacifism- lure enemies into bombs that are randomly scattered around, then blow them up.<br/>\r\nCheckpoint- you have 10 levels with limited amounts of enemies. Make every kill count!<br/>\r\nTitans- some enemies are randomly chosen to take several hits to kill. As if that wasn't bad enough, they are also huge!<br/>\r\nScorpion- you get a little laser trail that kills enemy on contact. Too bad you can't shoot.<br/>\r\nSuperthermal- Test your ability to dodge while an endless pile of lasers are constantly shot at you.<br/>\r\nImpervious- 3 safe zones are randomly scattered around. You are only able to shoot while inside them. Unfortunately for you, lasers sometimes pierce them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T02:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e84/e84e86fe89ddc8beadc4f88755e11c96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JR 01", "CrimsonBlackGames", "Ken Railey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["CrimsonBlackGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
