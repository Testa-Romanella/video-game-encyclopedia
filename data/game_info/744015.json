The familiar world is threatened by a threat from the past. As it turned out, humans are not the only intelligent beings who have ever dominated the earth. An ancient race of highly intelligent beings, owned this world long before humans. Born to be the first masters on earth, that's what they called themselves, \"The Firstborn.\" But 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub meteorite hit the Earth, destroying 90% of life on the planet and making it practically uninhabitable. In order to preserve their appearance, the firstborn had to go to sleep, putting their city into a state of hibernation.<br/>Kirk Hassle, a former special forces soldier, and now a thief, received an order from an anonymous person for an interesting artifact hidden in the ocean. Having sailed to the coordinates indicated by the anonymous person, he discovered an unusual crystal. Having seized it with the manipulator of the bathyscaphe, he provoked an explosion that spoiled the power supply system of the hibernation capsules in the city of the firstborn. From the explosion, Kirk falls into the bathyscaphe and hits his head, losing consciousness, but before that, he manages to give the system an order to ascend. Almost unconscious, Kirk wakes up already on the surface of the water. He has Crystal, but the water police are already on their way to him. He is arrested, and the crystal is seized.<br/>Meanwhile, the ancient city of the first-born people \u201cGentam\", was reborn from the abyss and rose into the heavens to find a new location for the location on land, throwing out a wave of energy that destroyed part of the east coast of the United States. The release was the result of a failed battery in one of the life support systems of the ancient city. The city of Wilmington turned into ruins, many people died, and the rest lost their homes. The ruined city became a new foundation for Gentam.<br/>Hassl survives, but loses his memory of recent events. He is taken to a special prison.<br/>A young girl, Zendaya, an antiquities hunter, goes to the ruins in search of \"artifacts\" for which they will pay well. At the same time, an archaeology student named Yoko is conducting his own personal investigation into the causes of the cataclysm. Everything that was dear to him, everyone he loved, died in this tragedy. He returned to the city to find out the truth about what happened and visit his destroyed house.<br/>The Primordial ones decide to launch a process of controlled terraforming of the Earth in order to bring the climate to a state suitable for them. This threatens the disappearance of all mankind from the face of the earth.<br/>Hassle escapes from prison, and the ruins of Wilmington become the only place to hide. Meanwhile, Youko goes to investigate the scene of the tragedy, and Zendaya, the city that appeared. Chance brings all three heroes together.
