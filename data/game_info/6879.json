In order to survive, it is crucial to scavenge resources, look for food, find shelter, mend your boat and take care of your health. </p>\n<p>The players have a certain time limit as they have to advance further the river before the rains catch up with them. </p>\n<p>The game features a crafting system, hence why it is important to look for various objects in the game world. A complicated wound treatment system is also present in the game as players have to know how to treat a snake bite or hypothermia. </p>\n<p>The developers put a strong emphasis on procedural generation used in the game. Anything from the river itself to every AI encounter is generated on-the-go. Fear, hunger, and aggression affect the NPCs behavior.</p>\n<p>Resembling a roguelike genre, the death in-game is permanent to some degree. You will have to start from the head of the river but you are able to save some of your items using your faithful dog.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2016-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-04T23:32:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/87a/87a29bcc56b6b6082ead1dd5e2510aaa.jpg", "website": "http://www.themolassesflood.com/the-flame-in-the-flood/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 402, "owned": 4010, "beaten": 68, "toplay": 74, "dropped": 226, "playing": 15}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 146, "ratings_count": 393, "suggestions_count": 473, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 398, "platforms": ["macOS", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["The Molasses Flood"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Curve Digital", "The Molasses Flood"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
