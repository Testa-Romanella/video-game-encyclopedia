Other than running you get to collect coins to buy more costumes, more music tracks for gameplay and some nifty perks to help you out just a little bit if you need it. This game features 10 Total Medals. Of course depending on your score that is. You can also talk to characters as well in case you feel a bit lonely running in the game! Psst...some of them have secrets to tell.Plus a day and night cycle that syncs with your phone' time to give a more natural feeling!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6c/c6c73b6c4098f4c93d6d60c1aadb7d8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CupofTeaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
