The cards will then give you rewards depending on how high a score you put onto the card. These rewards come in the form of more land (how many cards you draw each turn), more dice, and popularity.</p>\n<p>The majorit of the game is based on randomness, however you can strategise by trying to get more land, dice, or popularity, and can choose whether or not to reroll unused dice each round<br/></p>\n<p>You lose if your people start revolting when you become too unpopular.</p>\n\n<p>If the game gets a lot of attention I ma release updates with new kinds of cards and make the game more interesting, for now it will stay as is though.</p><p>Music thanks to JRymanMusic - https://soundcloud.com/user-421375680<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T05:25:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d29/d292089d89e1e84735325620c84cbf87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deja View"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
