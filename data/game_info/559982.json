The main goal of the game is to bring Satan the Darklord back to life by collecting innocent and pure souls from the living. Games are short, an average of 2-min-game. Graphics are flat and simple(pixel art from very very far). The scene takes place during the night, 3 days before the Samhein.<br/>The player with the greatest amount of collected souls wins the games and becomes Satan's wife (no regards of the player's gender), and the other one is burned alive.<br/><br/>We've treated the theme \"Stuck in a loop\" as a sacred and wicked thing, with an analogy to the Samhein ritual (Halloween nowadays). By sacrificing untouched souls, witches are sacrificing themselves to anger, pride and jealousy. They are stuck in this anger loop.<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun doing this game, and, as it is our first Ludum Dare (but not first gamejam tho), we are quite proud of the results, even if it is not perfect and some work has to be done. We are planning on working on it again later, to add some functionalities such as familiars which would help you collecting more souls, or changing light atmosphere or animations.<br/><br/>We are pretty satisfied of this final result, and we hope you will enjoy playing it\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you have any piece of advice or any question, please, feel free to ask in the comment section !\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>NEEDS: 2 X-Box (one) remotes and 2 pure and innocent humans<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>ROLES:<br/>Unity Developper: Baptiste Gu\u00e9rin<br/><br/>DA/Graphist: Sarah GERGAUD<br/>Graphist: Slevin Vlo\u00ebbergh<br/><br/>UX and Level Designer: Quentin Renoux<br/><br/>Yacine El Makhzoumi and Quentin Thomas, two amazing sound designers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>All Game Design Students at School of Design nantes Atlantiques.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Lots of love,<br/><br/>Sarah, Baptiste, Quentins, Sl\u00e9vin, Yacine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T08:20:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20163ceefeb234f3c8c724af5f05629.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danalix"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
