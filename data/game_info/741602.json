Ghost Suburb I is really special.</p>\n<p>&quot;Overview of Damages:<br />\nSeveral weeks of insomnia, coalescing into blood filled afternoons where a single friend resides inside that which I doubt is truly there.&quot;</p>\n<p>A game about a nurse in Midland Research Hospital Center, in the middle of a Hospital Zone- her name is Okay. She is a insomniac. There is a friend named Gertrud, who pesters her and is a giant floating sphere of darkness with a eye on it.<br />\nIt is highly debatable whether she is in fact a real thing.<br />\nThere is also a variety of activities which involve story based game play, and exploration. That is nice.<br />\nThere is a lot of electronic music as well. I guess that is alright too.<br />\nI probably should battle test it more before bringing this out-<br />\nbut like most things I make I will fix what I miss later at some later date,<br />\nfate can&#39;t stop you. But at least when it tries you can curb stomp it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T00:18:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55b3f9b42b503c0ecb4339f627837e19.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/5873/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
