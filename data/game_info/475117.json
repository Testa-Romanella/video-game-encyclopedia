In Sender, instead of assuming the role of an outsider, you play as an insider piloting a drone, collecting cassette tapes which you can use to warn others about the looming MindKill event. The entire game is singleplayer and comes with three normal maps and one bonus map. Endless high score possibilities await you with five different difficulty settings.</p>\r\nDRONES ARE SUPERHOT\r\n<p>A separate build of the game inspired by SUPERHOT is also downloadable, dating back to the 7th of April, 2016, entitled SenderHOT. This version of the game was developed for a SUPERHOT fan-game contest, and was one of the first 50 entries to automatically be awarded prizes.<br/></p>\n<p>Sender was created by me, Jack5, with some programming by TAT3XD and some sound effects by Navaro.
