Each different hero piece<br/>has a unique power that performs a certain purpose. The sidekick pieces are there to aid the<br/>heroes in their mission. The main objective of the game is to deliver a payload over to the base<br/>of the opposing player by eliminating a specific number of their pieces, rather than eliminating<br/>the king piece in the traditional chess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ENJOY !</p>\n<p>Btw that's the first game i have ever made!</p>\n<p>feed backs are more than welcome</p>\n<p>A quick demo in the link bellow</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=16etAY3yM7H1Ci5u1_WhTS5YIXjnQmSnP</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa4ac0f3abae68ce8dead32e2b2ee431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mohamed Usama Ismail"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
