ROwObin lives in a oasis in the middle of the desert, and his neightbors always visits him to drink some water. One day, ROwObin saw on the internet some news about a virus that was spreading everywhere. ROwObin so grabed one of his infinite crossbows, pucked a cactus from nowhere and started to slam it on his neightbors for them to not infect his water, even thought they're probably not infected at all!</p>\n<p>your objective here is to don't let ROwObin's neightbors reach his oasis!</p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTES:</em></strong></p>\n<p>-i'm gonna add music and a title screen as fast as possible, i'm just posting this now to dont lost the submission time of the jam. The game itself is practically done tho</p>\n<p>-There's 3 tipes of enemies that haves the chance to spawn in the game, but for some reason the third one isn't appearing on my gameplay, so if you see only 2 types of enemies plz warn me,\u00a0 because i don't know if its a bug or its just my bad luck for it to spawn (this enemy in specific should appear after Wave 10)</p>\n<p>-i'm not sure if this game does respect the \"Perma-death\" limitation of the jam, so if it can be considered a \"Perma-death\" game plz tell me ._.</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTROLS:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>-Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>-Z to attack (press while up arrow key is down to attack flying birds that may appear)</p>\n<p>-X to jump (but its useless since i didnt had time to give a utility to the jump)</p><p><strong><em>MY OPNION ABOUT THIS GAME:</em></strong></p><p>well, if there's something i'm definitelly proud\u00a0 in this game, it is the player's animations. They're simple, but i really liked them so much! The gameplay tho, i can't say the same...\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T02:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be1/be192f9177f0a1dba99b54e8ed3f5b1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lord Pillows"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
