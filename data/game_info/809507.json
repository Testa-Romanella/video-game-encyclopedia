Also it's set mostly over water.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mutators</strong><br/>\r\n  I was hoping to use \"Come on and Slam\" but I didn't get as much dev time as I\r\n  would have liked, so I couldn't implement camera shake because I didn't\r\n  structure my scenes correctly from the get go.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  If you count a tiny nod as using a mutator, then you could say I did \"Sports\"\r\n  because my game is named \"G.O.L.F\" as an acronym. The reason for this is I\r\n  originally planned to make a golf game but quickly realised I wasn't going to\r\n  get my development time during this jam due to a lot of real life\r\n  commitments, so I pivoted twice.\r\n</p>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>https://github.com/HellRok/great-offensive-line-force</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T09:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac3e69bc30aa6ad1cee3b1d360de2bb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["HellRok"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
