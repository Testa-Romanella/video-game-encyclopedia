I was still in school at that time and we had to write short stories. But I did not always want to write a new short story with new characters and different settings. So I developed a medieval fantasy world, whose king was Yogarte of Lat Trang. In every short story Yogarte had to face a new villain. It developed a typical good vs. evil story. Each story became longer and more complex. And then I finished school. So then they just lay there. Until a year ago when I was looking for an idea for a 3rd person game with a story. I thought it would be fun to reread those books. My own writing style develops noticeably after 6 years. So I sketched a little storyline that I want to use in my game. And I can proudly say that I don't have a typical good versus evil story anymore. But that's all I can say about the story, only that it is not finished in this version yet. And because I love easter eggs, I made a lot of references to the short stories and hid them in the game world. But I did not want to make just a story game. So I added my great passion for stealth games (at least I tried, but hey, I'm only one who is working on it). That's also the reason why unity assets were used and sound from freesound.org (great platform!). <br/></p>\n<p>And now I have a first playable version which I would like to share with you. <br/></p>\n<p>(I\u00a0can\u00a0only\u00a0test\u00a0the\u00a0windows\u00a0version.\u00a0I added a mac version, but this is not tested if it works...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c9b8e3f3c2ffa30f3d4f9eb4d7c769.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HannibalBarkas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
