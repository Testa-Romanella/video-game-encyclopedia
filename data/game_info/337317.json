The game starts with the cups being flipped over. Each turn a player moves one cup. The first person to get all their cups across the board wins. Don't get confused what cups are yours. Nothing is worse then getting a cup across the board and flipping it over to seeing it isn't your cup.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the board game Chaos.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T04:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/11509501862eba10dcf56e41b6fd654f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Trop's Workshop"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
