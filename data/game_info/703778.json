Unbelievable Zombie is a PVE game where it is a round-based style in a competitive small area-based map. My game design skills have improved throughout designing the fundamentals as this game is really fun to play and setting up a system to let my player interact with environmental assets by using the vending machine to gain ammo and health. Unbelievable Zombie includes game elements like game design, player &amp; AI input and animations. These are important to build a zombie survivor FPS game where my game design knowledge has increased to build a PVE map. The health system for both enemies and player are included which are important for game development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: W (Move forward), A (Move Left), S (Move backwards), D (Move Right), Shift (Run), Spacebar (Jump), E (Interact with the vending machines), Left Click (Shoot), Right Click (Aim), R (Reload) and Scroll with the middle mouse (Change gun).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:49:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae18878a08ae6096ab4ab5f55ddf8b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
