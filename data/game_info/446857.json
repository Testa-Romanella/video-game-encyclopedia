You have the ability to transform into a tornado to move, but you gotta recharge by hiding against a wall. Perhaps your tornado powers will alter the world around you as well...</p>\n<p>Controls: Click the mouse (or touchscreen) to direct the ninja from wall to wall.</p>\n<p>NOTE: None of the graphics are meant to depict blood. I meant it to look like red magic or something. Looking back, I see why some people thought there was blood XD</p>\n<p>What you see is the final result after many iterations of the concept where you have to stay <strong>connected</strong> to walls. Short but surprisingly fun!\u00a0My personal goals for this jam were as follows:</p>\n<ol><li>Unique but logical game mechanic.</li><li>Be more deliberate about the artwork than\u00a0I usually am.</li><li>Compose and record my own soundtrack.</li></ol>\n<p>With those goals in mind, I would consider this game a personal success! I would still love to hear your feedback in the comments though. Here's what I already would add/change (besides more levels):</p>\n<ol><li>Add collectibles throughout the levels (coins, etc) to add challenge/depth.</li><li>Replace placeholder sound effects.</li><li>Add a quick story as an introduction and conclusion</li><li>More animation in the world and main character.</li></ol>\n<p>That's all I've got. Enjoy the game, and thanks for reading :)</p>\n<p>Credits / Programs Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Game developed solo by @starkle</li><li>Engine - Godot Engine 3.2.1 - www.godotengine.org\u00a0</li><li>Artwork - Krita 4.2.9 - www.krita.org;\u00a0and GIMP 2.10 -\u00a0www.gimp.org\u00a0<ul><li>Art assets created by @starkle</li></ul></li><li>Music - LMMS 1.1.3 -\u00a0www.lmms.io<ul><li>Composed by @starkle, rendered with a soundfont I don't know the origins of :(</li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects - generated by www.bfxr.net</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T08:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da40d240e471baf861c27cd7b26733c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["starkle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
