After having her guitar smashed by the Soviet police, she bids to escape.</p>\n<p>There are multiple branches and ways to breach the wall itself using items and helps from friends, all without raising suspicion from the Stasi, or \"Secret Police.\"</p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made in around 9 days for Historical Game Jam III - the theme being The Cold War. We started out with a large scope until having to sculpt the options down. Our first goal was to capture the oppressive mood in East Berlin, using lighting and SFX.\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, and let us know how it goes in the comments!</p>\n<p>Game Design - K.C Dignan, Liam Guthrie</p>\n<p>Art - Neryko (Cristina Ruiz)</p>\n<p>Sound/Narrative - K.C Dignan</p>\n<p>Programming - Liam Guthrie</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T03:23:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c3038adb6cdbf1bde138ed8190e0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neryko", "K.c.dignan", "liamgu3"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
