How very strange. Furthermore, it would appear that you are the only rational life form in this Sector. Well then, CONGRATULATIONS! I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station! Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who, according to the logbook, er\u2026 ran into some wormlike Aliens\u2026 Oh, nothing to worry about!<br />\nTo keep the same thing from happening to you, there&#39;s a lot you&#39;re going to have to do. Amongst others, there\u2019s the development of further Sectors, maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors, who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement. Oh, and before I forget \u2013 it&#39;s probably just a bug in my security protocols anyway \u2013 but my sensors are showing just loads of enemy creatures in all of the other Sectors\u2026<br />\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let&#39;s get to work! Let us join forces to conquer space.&quot;<br />\nSpacebase Startopia captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor. In addition to the challenging single player Campaign and the versatile battle mode, there are also competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes for up to four players. And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks, entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge, the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp-tongued manner.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T18:45:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/495/49504d4297c0431c61f9699b23f7046e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 53, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 91, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 814, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Realmforge Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
