We don\u2019t know and we do not ask.. It goes into the reactor and we get power! Neat, huh?</p>\r\nGray goo - Middle pipe:\r\n<p>Because of the strange power goo, some weird machine started making strange noises.. Something called a geig..gagameter? no? geigo.. well! nevermind! We just have to chug some of the gray goo from the middle pipe into the reactor to stay safe for a while longer!</p>\r\nBlue stuff - Right pipe:\r\n<p>This strange reactor gets hot, I know! its suuuuper strange! Anyway, open the valves to drown it in water.
