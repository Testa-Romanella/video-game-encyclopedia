Also \"attacking\" the other cast members will bring down the Hero's courage.</p><p>When you attack the Leading Lady she runs to the exit.  She will panic if she sees you.</p><p>The Extra will flee if he sees you, and \"die\" if attacked.</p><p>You can divert the Extra and the Leading Lady by moving objects in their path.</p><p>Remember:  Winning is not defeating the Hero, winning is pleasing the Director</p><p>Thank you for playing!</p><p>Feel free to make a let's play or review of this game and monetize it.<br/></p><p>Note the .exe \"should\" work on Mac and Linux, but I have not tested them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f151ceec0484dd9b4525434d7466036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["jw608"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
