It's a bit like watching clouds fused with a Rorschach test.<br/><br/>There is no goal in sf\u00e4re, there are no points, no achievements. Sf\u00e4re is a toy. Without you and your imagination there is no meaning. <br/><br/>Take your time and relax. There is no reason to rush.<br/>For total relaxation turn on the show mode and watch how particles create beautiful images on their own.<h3>How to play</h3>Rotate spheres to change patterns and music.  Experiment with the buttons.<br/><br/><br/>You can mirror half of the screen for symmetrical effects, this makes it more likely to find relatable figures and shapes.<br/><br/><br/>Invert the visuals for a fresh musical experience while maintaining your creation. <br/><h3>Features</h3>Sf\u00e4re currently contains 3 different musical compilations. Due to a high amount of randomization the experience will be different every time you play.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T03:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd831dc7873d6430b23f3a903bb1f9df.jpg", "website": "https://sf\u00e4re.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Falkenbrew"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Falkenbrew"], "esrb_rating": null}
