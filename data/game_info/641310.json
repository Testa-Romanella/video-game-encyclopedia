Press X or space to flip the level. When you move left or right, you will keep going until you hit a wall, only then will you be affected by gravity.</p><p>FOR EXAMPLE: You press right and move over a pit. As long as you are moving through the air, you will not fall into the pit, instead you will just float until you hit a wall. Then, if you able to fall, you will. If not, you'll just sit there until you move again. When you flip the level, your player will still be attracted downwards, so you may be able to reach different paths by flipping.</p>\n<p>20+ levels</p>\n<p>Minimalist geometric art style</p>\n<p>5+ uniquely puzzling features</p>\n<p>All code, music, and assets were made within the 1-week time frame\u00a0of the jam</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by Miguel Gessaghi</p>\n<p>Art and code by MegaProgramGuy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:54:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/228/22878c03cbe30a6222c96eae589ceb63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MegaProgramGuy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
