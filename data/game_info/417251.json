Unfortunately, seagulls have invaded their lair and are reeking havoc. Not liking the view from the other side, you and your crew must chase off the rascals and recover the gold that they have dropped into the cove. Will you and your cronies overcome the challenge, or will you be out-scallywagged by a bunch of birds?</p>\n<p>Starting as the captain, swap between your crew by looking at a crew member and pressing down on the game pad. Each of the three crew types have a special ability. The captain can honk a horn by pressing both controller triggers at the same time. The sailor is holding magnets and can fish gold pieces out of the water by looking at the coins. The pirate has guns in both hands and excels at dealing with seagulls by pressing either controller trigger. Use all of the abilities to score the most points and have the most fun.</p>\n<p>Our game was designed and run using the base version of HTC Vive on Unreal. The game is called Scallywag's Cove and was created by LWIAY. Team memebers include Ryan Bevan, Nagaraj Raparthi, Anantha Natarajan and Sitong Deng. All memebers attend Texas A&amp;M University.
