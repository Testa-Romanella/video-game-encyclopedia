The hints can be white (cow) or black (bull):\u00a0<br/>The white hint means that the color of a chip is correct;<br/>The black hint means that color and the position of some chip are guessed correctly.\u00a0<br/>The order of the hints does not matter and does not depend on the order of the chips in the code.</p>\n<p>This process continues until the player finds the secret code.</p>\n<p>Once per day you can try to solve the daily code and compare your results with the results of other breakers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:10:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b1b881af464c4d93a2a8673a36c00bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vadym"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
