{"id": 924578, "slug": "elementalist-battles", "name": "Elementalist Battles", "name_original": "Elementalist Battles", "description": "<p>Two players create a deck of 7 element cards and 1 special element card. 3 element cards, along with the special element card, are placed on the field. Players will gain mana at the start of their turn, which is a resource that allows element cards to use their abilities. Cards will take turns using abilities at the cost of mana with the aim to destroy the opponents' cards by depleting all of their element power. When a card is destroyed, it gets replaced by a new card from your deck until your deck runs out of cards. The game ends when all of one player's element cards have been destroyed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T16:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eeaa78196e2ec831e1f6b6ba1df56b80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StarmasterK13"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
