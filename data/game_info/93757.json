The earth is no sphere of dirt surrounded by space, but a sphere of space surrounded by dirt! The sun floats in the center of the solar system, as you travel out away from the sun eventually you reach the atmosphere, then further out is the sea, a huge translucent sphere surrounding the sun, further out in the depths of the sea you will reach the ground. Nobody knows whats out there underground, some miners speculate there may be other inner seas!</p><p><strong>How to play:</strong></p><p>All controls in the game are bound to mouse input, moving your mouse dynamically effects the whale. Move your mouse up and down to turn in that direction or swim by swishing the tail up and down multiple times build up speed. moving the mouse left or right will allow you to roll in the water to turn. </p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Game and assets by me, Jazz Cousins, music by Ben Thornton, sea textures from a painting by Tom Cousins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-28T20:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/5947c10ffe05074cd383079d5bbfe76c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jazz Cousins"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
