Humans, Aliens, Cyborgs and Sentient AIs from all systems race for a promise of immortality in the most watched sport in the galaxy. Only one will achieve it, the rest will perish in the process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Deck RX you'll  choose between different pilots and cars, each with their unique cards and driving styles. You can win the race by reaching the finish line first or destroying all enemies on your way. Between races, you will purchase new cards and other enhancements as you reach the way to the top of the Deck Race. <br/><br/><h3>Different Racing Strategies</h3> Combo your cards according to your pilot, car, and design your racing strategy. Will you combo your cards into a hunt for opponents to get them off the track? Or, would you rather prep your deck to go fast and drift past all the curves? How about warping and manipulating positions and stage elements to your advantage?<br/><br/><h3>Unique Artistic Style</h3> A retro take on an underground urban sci-fi style, with anime influences. And also a bunch of shaders. <br/><br/><h3>Replayability</h3>A dozen cars/pilots to play with: humans, cyborgs, robots and alien monsters of all kinds, each with their own racing strategy and unique cards, which can be tailored further into branching playstyles. Multiple of hand-crafted tracks in several different worlds, each world containing unique mechanics. Hundreds of cards to combo your deck.<br/><br/><h3>Boss Battles</h3>Each world's final race will contain a challenging boss character with unique skills and driving style. Defeat these drivers to unlock them and play with them in the future!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T05:26:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a639e7bb8e7640421d1e1815d845479.jpg", "website": "https://meteorbytestudios.com/deckrx/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meteorbyte Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meteorbyte Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
