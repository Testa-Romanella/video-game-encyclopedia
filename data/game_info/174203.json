Square returns after Diamond breaks up with him. Can he learn the value of hard work once more? Will another, more intense cooking competition win her over? Again? Or would Square find romance in the shape of a Triangle manager?\u00a0</p>\n<p>One thing's for sure, you're probably going to regret the experience!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Awful Summer Jam 2018, and inspired by unnecessary romance subplots that are often reset with each sequel. This is a dating simulator sequel built using Monogame when Twine exists. It's unnecessary to the core!</p>\n<p>Writer: RikkidoSeph</p>\n<p>Programmer: Lewis Carter</p>\n<p>Director/Programmer/whatever: CrashScreen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8d615eefb2799fbeec3bdeaf89654c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrashScreen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
