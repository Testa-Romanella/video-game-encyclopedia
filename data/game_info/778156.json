You have 3 lives to avoid cacti and enemies and to survive as long as possible and to kill as many enemies as you can. WASD to move and left click to shoot. Score in top right is how many enemies you've killed. Score in bottom right is seconds you've survived. The number above your head indicates how many lives you have.
