In it, you, the main character, are a D<strong>yse-</strong> a creature that obtains items by rolling over them, and when you flip those items to your top side, you can use them. Using your amazing powers of revolution, you must escape the dungeon by beating puzzles, traps, and enemies. We hope you enjoy our game, and please stick around for future updates. Also consider donating.(jk)</p>\n<p>Currently, there are only two levels - more are on the way though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61b/61be00c7b02f1697c344c9eef17adb5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["schmo103"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
