It is a stand-alone expansion pack to Men of War.</p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>There is no fictional plot present in the game. Instead, the players take part in real battles of World War II. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features multiple singleplayer campaigns for the U.S. Army, Vermacht, Great Britain, the USSR, and Japan. Nonetheless, the game does not focus on these campaigns much, as they are only used to introduce the players to the core mechanics of the game before allowing them to compete in the game&#39;s multiplayer mode.</p>\n<p>Each campaign consists of 5 missions, 3 of which focus on the assault on the positions of the enemy, with the next one revolving around holding your own ground and counter-attacking the enemy forces. In the last mission of any campaign, the players have to control a small squad that is sent out behind the enemy lines to sabotage the enemies&#39; defense.</p>\n<p>During the game, the players take control of specific combat squads and armor, that can be called in by using the reinforcement points. These points are awarded to the player upon capturing and holding the control points. The capture of new positions allows for purchasing new vehicles and troop upgrades. The main objective of any singleplayer mission is to capture all the points on the map.</p>\n<p>Men of War: Assault Squad comes bundled with a map editor.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2011-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T07:23:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31bac382a13d14c5748b481326f4092b.jpg", "website": "http://www.menofwargame.com/assault/", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 57, "owned": 1206, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 27, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 110, "ratings_count": 72, "suggestions_count": 601, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 73, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digitalmindsoft"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["1C-SoftClub", "1C Company"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
