In the womb they almost always form as twins. On Misimnio only the strongest survive therefore, they begin their fight for dominance before birth.\r\n</p>\n<p>You play as an unborn Misimniomorph, you must compete with your twin and a deadly bacteria in order to survive. Your twin will do everything in their power to stop you, whoever consumes enough super cells first will eat the other and be given the privilege of being born.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\r\nGoal\r\n<p>Bacteria decreases your score and cells increase your score.\u00a0Eat as many super cells as possible and avoid the bacteria. If you get to 150 points before your twin you will win, if not, you will be eaten.</p>\r\nCredits<li>Art - Christan Coskey</li><li>Programming - Brandon-lee Coskey</li>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T13:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95a/95a4c3e3535e8cd945bf5d1cdc60d95d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClarkDjent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
