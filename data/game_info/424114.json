Mental health and other things stopped me from progressing as fast as I would have liked.</p>\n<p>Now it's done. Another game, with a few improvements.

Do you rush through or do you risk exploring?</p>\n<p>Both choices have their advantages and both have their prizes!</p>\n<p>I'm most proud of the boss fight. As it's something I've never done before and I think I did well.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can use keyboard or gamepad control.
