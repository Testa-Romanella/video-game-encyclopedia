The bunnies will hold \"Catalysts\", that you'll need in order to win.<br/><br/>Understanding which of these otherworldly baubles you need, and actually getting them before they disappear, will be half the battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No reason to get all tricked out before the next hand-to-hand: Every battle gives you a different collection of mystical \"Arcana\" to wield. Some of them are good to go, and others you have to unlock on the job.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Murdering doe-eyed bunny beasts isn't enough to win! Somehow, you'll need to get enough \"Gods' Wine\" to close the flaming portals that keep sending out more opponents.<br/><br/>Sometimes the rabbits will drop this celestial nectar, and sometimes a more economic approach is required.<br/><br/>If you've got a little chemist inside you somewhere, perhaps you'd prefer making your own divine kombucha.<br/>Good thing every critter killed is a pi\u00f1ata of goo-covered treasure.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-01T08:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0bdf6a9cce2f50e8816f5fa18ac4797.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["takunomi"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["takunomi"], "esrb_rating": null}
