Just like the game it's based on (Probably not Galaga), CK will be a ruthless, 4 stage, 22 level romp as you play PauperBoy, a young kid who sets out to save PrincessGirl from the evil clutches of BaronMan.<br/><br/>Unlike it's predecessors, we leverage the power of connectivity to host tournaments (with a championship!), verify high scores, and have a global leaderboard.<br/><br/>And As Always,<br/>if anyone's interested, a kill screen is coming up.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T02:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1a5e4f13c62758be7711731a70274c.jpg", "website": "http://www.drowningmonkeys.com/castle-kong", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drowning Monkeys Games", "Prime Time Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Drowning Monkeys Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
