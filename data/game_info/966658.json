Each level features different ways to escape with danger along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRealistic graphics, minimal user interfaces, and dreary ambience will ensure an immersive experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(multiplayer not in the game yet due to errors.)<br/>\r\nExplore the backrooms with a team of up to 16 players. Be warned, as teammates may no-clip into other areas of the map and one member of your team must find the exit alive to escape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraverse though 8 unique levels based on backrooms lore with regular content updates adding more. Each level features a different way to escape with various danger along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheck every corner so you won't be caught off guard by one of 4 hostile entities in the backrooms, each with their own mechanics you'll need to quickly learn if you want to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(multiplayer not in the game yet due to errors.)<br/>\r\nCommunicate with your teammates with proximity voice chat. Be sure to not wander far away from your team, as you can easily get lost in the confusing expanse of the backrooms. Entities can also hear you, so stay quiet whenever you're near any danger.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T03:53:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bbe53f8f95d1d0466a05f9461b515c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["~Nutty~"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["~Nutty~"], "esrb_rating": null}
