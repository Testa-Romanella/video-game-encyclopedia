Whether it's a complex or a beginner video game. This game is not a complex game but a straightforward game: Guess The Number. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the game for the web.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My Javascript programming is still intermediate and I'm still looking to improve on the language but this game has definitely leveled up my Javascript programming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Guess The Number, there will be three screens. The first screen is the start screen then comes the game screen, where (obviously) the users can play the game, and the last screen is the end screen which it displays the user's final score.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To start things off, I selected\u00a0my code editor (Visual Studio Code)\u00a0and started picking the right fonts and colors to display the screen. Then I wrote the HTML of the game;\u00a0I wrote the CSS for the game, start and end screen;\u00a0The logic of the game will then begin to be written in\u00a0 JavaScript. An example of this is accessing and checking the input of the user and seeing whether the user input is right or wrong. Another example of this is writing the logic for the end screen. I will display the end screen and display the score to the user.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T14:11:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/07694136729f1c0def08880a8132c4ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OnePersonStudio"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
