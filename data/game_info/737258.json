Find your way to its head and give it a real talking to to get it to go away, whilst trying to avoid the local fauna and worryingly sharp spikelichen. How fast can you get it done? I'd love to hear in the comments!<br/></p>\n<strong>THE CONTROLS</strong>\n<p>The controls be:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys to move</li><li>W/Up Arrow/Space to jump</li><li>R to restart</li></ul>\n<strong>MY THOUGHTS<br/></strong>\n<p>I think this game went alright; I got a fair bit of polish done on it and I'm pleased with how the graphics turned out, particularly the animations - walk cycles have always intimidated me, so it's nice to have made one regardless of the final quality just to say I have done. I did have to rush a bit at the end though - for that reason, there are a few finishing touches left off that I'd like to have included, like some more particles or background decor and ambience. Another thing is the lack of content, since I'd have liked to make the experience last longer than just a few minutes, as well as add some more challenges or mechanics, though every time I make a platformer it gets faster and easier to do these things. Overall, though, I like how it came out, so I'm pleased with it, and I hope you enjoy it too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T08:31:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e58/e5827f64cb9ebd3d5640110eeeb2f1ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
