You are Rangrid, a viking warrior of Midgard. Your mission is to enter the castle of the evil Sjkaldi and retrieve the 11 leaves for Yggdrasil.\u00a0Eleven is the magic number that protects the Brifost Bridge. Eleven are the Valkyries, eleven are the sons of Odin. Eleven are the leaves, eleven is the magic number</p>\n<br/>\r\n\r\nPoster design by Fran Kapilla\r\n<br/>\n<p>\u3010\ufeff\uff54\uff48\uff45\u3000\uff43\uff4f\uff4e\uff54\uff52\uff4f\uff4c\uff53\u3011<br/></p>\n<p>Q (up) A (down and shield)\u00a0<br/>O (left) P (right) M (sword)</p>\n<p>THE GAME</p>\n<p>30 screens that form the castle of the evil Sjkaldi and the tree Yggdradil's forest.\u00a0You can move through all the screens in any direction, back and forth. The map is made up of platforms but there are also enemies you have to fight. Each enemy has its vital points. For example, you can block enemy arrows or sword blows with your shield. Then with your sword you can finish them off.</p>\n<p>Forest, lava, spikes, traps, caves, swimming water, castle rooms, keys, levers, etc. The game appears to have a very classic aesthetic, but I have tried to give it a personal touch, especially set in the Nordic myths. <br/></p>\n<p>EXTRA MINIGAME</p>\n<p>There is an epilogue, it is a mini game of text options. It is something very brief that serves as an end. The epilogue is in English and Spanish, different versions.<br/></p>\n\n<p>SEQUENTIA SOFT</p>\n<p>It is a wonderful hobby that I do when I have time and when I can.
