Releasing a playable demo is a major milestone, it took a lot of effort and energy to get there, especially since this is my first game dev project. I am satisfied with the result and I hope it provides a good sense of what the full game would look like. I would love to get feedback to know what you think about the demo and how I could make it better.</p>\n<p>Developing a game like Uniwardens which is, I believe, somewhat ambitious, requires a lot of time, especially for a solo dev. Depending on the feedback, I will think about how I could continue the development and make a proper roadmap to carry out this project. The full game would include the complete story, several areas to explore with many people to meet, main and side quests to complete, more enemies, more puzzle mechanics and a more complex equipment / leveling system.</p>\n<p>I will get you updated about how the project progresses. Until then, I hope you enjoy the demo and I would truly appreciate you take time to provide me with helpful feedback.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game is entirely developed by Florestan De Moor using the Godot engine, with some precious help from Sol\u00e8ne Mirliaz.<br/></p>\n<p>The OST is composed by Florestan De Moor.
