{"id": 742031, "slug": "roulette-master-2", "name": "Roulette Master", "name_original": "Roulette Master", "description": "<p>This application is a rendition of the coin flip statistics execution. The wheel is comprised of 0 to 36. This is the single zero table. This is not simply a counter but an actual betting engine. The winning bets are placed on the even numbers. This represents the EVEN bet on the roulette table. EVEN, ODD, RED, BLACK are all bets that are 48% in favor of the gambler. The bet cannot exceed the winnings. The <b>Bet Percent Option</b> starts at 0.0001. This equates to 0.001% of the winnings. The losing bet is doubled each time till a win is gained then the bet reverts back to the initial Bet % option. This rate keeps the <b>Bet Chain</b> sequence far below the winnings for any loses obtained. There are a number of controls. The execution rate can be slowed down. The Bet % option value can be raised to 100%. There is a button for <b>single stepping</b> and one for <b>automatic</b> execution. The single step allows the operator to actually see that this engine works. <b>Reset</b> zeroes out the engine and starts over. The Bet Chain indicator shows the size of the bet sequence till the winning bet is accomplished. I have chosen the win limit to 1 Nonillion. That is 1 with 10 sets of 3 zeros. Most have never seen numbers this large. The betting amount escalates quite rapidly. The engine can be seen transacting bets of billions of dollars a second. The bet count is there to measure the bets made. Multiply this by seconds or minutes to get a feel of real time transactions. Don't get your hopes up in commercial betting parlours. There are limits that control the minimum and maximum bets in accordance with the bet chain allowance. This keeps the odds with the house.
