Naturally, things got weird. <br/><br/>As a male citizen of the Empire, you are oppressed and objectified at every turn. Your goal is to choose a futa mistress from among many, and seduce them\u2026 before someone else decides you might be better as their bimbo slave.<br/><br/>If you like power play, strong feminine characters, and deeply flawed people, we're off to a good start. If you also like dominant women with enormous cocks plundering innocent boys, then you should absolutely go play this game. Stop reading this description and hit the download link; we'll be here when you come back. <br/><br/>WARNING - The game deals heavily with themes of femdom, bondage, objectification, gender roles, mind control, dystopia, and slavery.  There is also a really tremendous amount of butt stuff. Persons who are likely to be offended by any of these things should probably just give the game a pass, for everyones' sake.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-09T21:21:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c6ff237171111ff2892148fc4e1fce.jpg", "website": "http://www.fdwgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 374, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["New Dawn Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["New Dawn Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
