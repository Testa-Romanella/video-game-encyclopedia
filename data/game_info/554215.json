I'm tremendously proud of this newest version and feel that it's the best rendition of it yet.<br/>I'm posting this to itch so that more people can find it, or support it if they want.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tetrageddon Games is probably the weirdest most tortured not-a-game game you can experience. It is the internet condensed into a slew of interactive experiences that serve as something of a love-letter to the web of the past.</p>\n\n\n<p>The experience is thoroughly riddled with hidden extras and tangents. Much like a virtual arcade, it largely consists of a collection of games. Among others, these include: Anatomically Incorrect Dinosaurs, FROGGY (It's Hungry), and Electric Love Potatoes.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tetrageddon Games is a web project. Most of it runs in the browser, and then eventually finds its way to your desktop. It's net-art as game, website-as-game...<br/>Itch.io is treated as part of the game, where pieces of the website are hidden across itch for you to find.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:46:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a6/7a6aba066fbb93ee753aad703e76e3ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alienmelon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
