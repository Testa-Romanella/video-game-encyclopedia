{"id": 684944, "slug": "badland-envoys", "name": "Badland Envoys", "name_original": "Badland Envoys", "description": "In a broken world of desolated wastelands, chaos, rage and destruction dictate the rules of survival. Far stretches of the ruined land are ruled by self-acclaimed warlords and bandits that roam the roads with their diesel-fueled war machines, delivering the cruelty to anyone that dares to enter their domain. In all of this madness, pockets of a new civilization start to shimmer. That\u2019s where you come in. As a member of the Badland Envoy\u2019s, and elite guild of skilled drivers, you\u2019ll be tasked with leading the expeditions between towns and newly created settlements, establishing safe routs, protecting the cargo, and eliminating any encountered threat. You\u2019ll be a messenger, a porter, a warrior, and most of all, a new hope for those that try to rebuild humanity.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes?<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you\u2019re get stopped out there, you\u2019ll die. Think fast, drive faster, react instantly. Remember, it\u2019s not always about the speed of your car \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s about the speed of your trigger.<br/><br/><br/>Spending some of that hard-earned buck on your rides is always a good idea. Installing new armor plating, homing missiles launcher or a high tech nitro system can make a difference between life and death out there on the road. Be good to your chariots and they\u2019ll repay you with the same. Trust me.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So you\u2019ve got a few extra wheels and hired some new crew members? Good. You can trust them to have your back, but when things get really tough, don\u2019t hesitate to give them commands from a more tactical point of view. It can save your life, and more importantly \u2013 your cargo.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If it wasn\u2019t about the job, we\u2019ll be no different than the bandits. The orders placed through the Guild give us goals, meaning and hope for a better feature. Remember that all orders have different sets of requirements. Delivering medicine through hills requires more vehicles, different gear and more specialized crew than a recon mission deep into marshlands. Plan ahead and you\u2019ll be fine.<br/><br/>See you on the road.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Experience fast-paced, action-oriented vehicular combat.<br/></li><li>Use Tactical mode for more top-down approach.<br/></li><li>Unlock deadly vehicles to ride, upgrade and shine with style.<br/></li><li>Gather unique vehicle customizations, including armor plating, weapons, and tuning parts.<br/></li><li>Encounter savage enemies, each witch different strengths, weaknesses and combat tactics.<br/></li><li>Challenge world bosses, including armored train and mechanized desert fortress.<br/></li><li>Complete dozens of orders spread through the far reaches of Badlands.<br/></li><li>Recruit additional crew members, each with a different set of unique skills and traits.<br/></li><li>Traverse various environments \u2013 from town ruins, through desert wastelands, all to the bogged wetlands.<br/></li><li>Experience a day and night cycle that affects gameplay \u2013 It\u2019s harder to aim at night, but remember - it works both ways.<br/></li><li>Witness various environmental conditions and dangers, like corrosive acid rain or deadly desert storm.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T03:14:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5975b09cefb0b36cbf24967cf7e55ada.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brave New Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ARP Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
