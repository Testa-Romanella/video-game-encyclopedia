This is a piece that holds a big place in my heart, as it's the first piece I shared with others after a plagiarism incident that cost me most of my social life and mental well-being. It's not a perfect story, nor do I expect it to be, but I hope the story of Oliver and Josephine will bring at least one smile to your face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T05:34:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e8/9e80cb749a4b71e13099999f19880796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vixxvicks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
