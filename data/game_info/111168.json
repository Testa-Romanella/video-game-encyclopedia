Thanks for looking at my crap.</p>\n<p>This game is the introduction to The Champion, a fantasy comic about a girl who hates her job. The rest of the story, along with all my other comics, can be found at http://saintcomix.com</p>\n<p>The game doesn't have much \"gameplay\" per se and is mostly about dialogue and story. It's really more of a visual novel wearing the flayed skin of a JRPG.</p>\n<p>I'm considering doing more segments of The Champion's story as games like this one. If you like that idea and want to support more games like this being made, please consider supporting this game with a donation.</p>\n<p>If you want to support me in all my endeavors (I make games, comics, and videos as well) I have a Patreon where you can do just that:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/bensaint</p>\n<p>And finally, while I'm talking about all my web presence shit, here's my YouTube channel where I do a bunch of stuff including exclusive speeddraw vids for my patrons:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDMyKWNOG69SyM8rb9vuFvg</p>\n<p>Anyway that's all I've got to say here, enjoy the game, if you want to let me know what you think you can tweet at me at http://twitter.com/ItsAllSoUgly or email me at iasucomic@gmail.com and tell me stuff.
