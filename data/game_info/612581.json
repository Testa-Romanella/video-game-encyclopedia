You will be conducting experiments on unique microbial life. Discover new species, research their effects, and grow your cellular ecosystem!<br/></p>\n<p>In Cellular Surge you use various species of microbes to balance the resources of your petri dish. Every species effects the ecosystem differently and you must balance the needs of each cell to grow your populations and complete each experiment.</p><p>We're excited to release Cellular Surge as our first game! Made by me (Kchem) and coolbot100x as ReckWorks. This game was made for the Go Godot Game Jam 2021. We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Advice:<br/><br/>Stuck? Check the comments for a guide!<br/><br/>Want to skip to sandbox mode? Our sandbox can be permanently unlocked for you by beating the game. However, If you just wanna play with your Cellular friends then you can access it by right clicking the bottom right of Level Select screen 3 times, then left clicking the back arrow. Don't tell anyone you heard that from me though.</p>\n<p>Every level has a 100% and repeatable solution, but there's often more\u00a0then one!<br/></p>\n<p>Cellular Surge will require careful timing, but don't be afraid to try new combinations of cells\u00a0and micro-manage your\u00a0environment!<br/></p>\n<p>The Inspector is your friend, right click a cell in the dish to view it's info with the Inspector open, locked cells won't tell you as much, but it's still worth checking.<br/><br/>Watch your resource bars closely, most experiments can be passed simply by keeping the numbers you want up, up, and the numbers you want down, down. <br/><br/>Expect some trial and error, you're likely to fail on the first or second try\u00a0so you can learn about and master the game!<br/><br/><br/></p><p>Credits:<br/> Art and Concept: Kchem <br/>Programming and game design: Coolbot100s<br/>Attribution of freely licensed assets: Clint Bellannger, Fupi, Dizzy Crow, Deva, Phonson, Tom Peter, Kerrie Lake <br/>All third party assets sourced from OpenGameArt.com A wonderful resource.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T08:30:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1eb4a070effd79cadffcf3842cafec43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kchem"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
