This project got discontinued. In this game, you pick any character you would like: Peter (Weenie), or Mac (Burg).<br/>You can shoot,kill, and mach in this game. It starts off with a tutorial, then it teleports you to Fry Boys level. In the end of the Fry Boys, theres a boss fight, but, you can't kill the boss, so you will get softlocked, until some game maker genius fixes all of this.<br/>So, in this archive, theres the game + unfinished,testing,cancelled levels.<br/>Have fun playing.<br/>Controls: Z - Jump, X - Attack, C - Shoot, Shift - Dash<br/>Pizza Tower Guy's Tumblr:\u00a0https://wienerdontusedrugs.tumblr.com<br/>Pizza Tower Guy's Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/user?u=15632871<br/>Cover image by\u00a0dudi123456#4198</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T07:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d8/7d8f48860cab8e9e6356b73fa9690464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["piss"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
