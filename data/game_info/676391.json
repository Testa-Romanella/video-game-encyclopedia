Mysterious enemies are there to ruin your day and progressing with the service will eventually make things\u2026 unstable.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to survive as much as you can, keeping the customers satisfied, and killing meatball monsters.</p>\n<p>Touch the table to start the game!</p>\n<p>HINT: The dish pile can act as a flail if it has enough momentum (and enough plates...)</p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Left mouse click to throw dishes to customers. It won't fill them up, but you can calm their temper.</p>\n<p>Right mouse click to use the shotgun, one bullet is enough to kill each enemy! Shotgun is also used to propel yourself.</p>\n<p>The number of dishes you hold is also your health bar, don't get hit without holding any plate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Touch the customer to deliver the dish on top of the pile you are holding. The customer will only accept the dish he wants at the moment.</p>\n<p>5 plates fill a customer, customers stack their eaten plates on the table, under their gun.</p>\n<p>If customers are not fed they become angry and fill their gun with bullets, after 5 bullets customers will shoot you, calm them down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Full customers will leave, and drop ammo.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses more enemies will spawn, more customers will show up and the chef will become progressively less efficient.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:04:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/769/769fdbc83d8be6ad0138c812d8ac7740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WollyTD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
