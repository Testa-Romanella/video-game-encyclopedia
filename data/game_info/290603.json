The goal is\u00a0to last or run as far as the player can while building a score as big as possible using distance and coin combos.<br/><br/>The player can also be upgraded to last longer and use energy more sparingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end this is the first game project I finished thanks to the FFS Game Jam. There is still lots to be done and will appreciate any feedback and critique.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T03:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50e/50eb277a31532466c4a5406b43581d9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PsychoSTS"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
