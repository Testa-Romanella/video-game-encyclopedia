Some levels are straightforward and easy, but some are really hard to figure out and even harder to get 3 stars on. You really have to think and strategize, which is something I really enjoy doing. Can you save all the Pilcri and beat an existing low score? With more worlds coming, there's plenty more to look forward to and more challenges ahead. Thank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a fun little puzzle type game. You move the Pilcri guys around to exit the area. Each area is different and is blocked in some way. It starts out easy and gets harder and harder. Fun. Fun. Fun.\u201d - <strong>Mike Slifker</strong> (BiffsGamingVideos)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe real beauty of \"Not Without You\" lies in its simplicity. The interface is clean and intuitive, and the puzzles are challenging, yet solvable. Completing a level feels like an accomplishment! I really enjoyed my time with this game, and I highly recommend it to puzzle game fans!\u201d - <strong>TheLazyGeneral </strong>(Twitch Streamer)</p>\n\n<p>It's cute, not <em>easy</em>.
