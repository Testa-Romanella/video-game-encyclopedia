Hire employees and customize your buildings with different types of offices, facilities and accessories! Watch your company come alive and grow while your building reach the sky.<br/><br/>Smooth Operators 2 offers a deeper simulation, where focus is put not only on balancing operational workloads, but all aspects of running a functional outsourced Customer Experience operation. The building mechanic is reimagined to allow the player to create a very dynamic, organic and unique office building. All characters classes - not only Agents - have a clear objective in the game, and the player needs to balance and satisfy more workloads each day, as well as developing the business in a controlled fashion. The game also includes a new Research system that the player can prioritize how the player sees fit.<br/><br/>But managing your Customer Experience company won\u2019t be an easy task! Employees will get upset if you don\u2019t consider their well-being. You need to balance your staffing to handle all types of workloads that comes with building a company.<br/><br/>Smooth Operators 2 also offers a unique interface - an intelligent NLP/AI driven chat functionality with Jill the receptionist, who serves as your guide through the game.<br/><br/>Smooth Operators isn't relased in it's full state yet, and is still being fiddled with. I'd love to get your feedback and if you find any bugs! =)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:40:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c244acc23c440ad6ab1b89fcbb626eda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heydeck Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
