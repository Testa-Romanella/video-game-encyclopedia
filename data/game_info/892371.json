The aim of the game is to click on\u00a0the light blue target as often as you can within the 20 second time limit. Whilst clicking the light blue target you must avoid clicking on a red circle. Clicking a red object will cost you a second.</p>\n<p>The game can be player with the mouse only.</p>\n<p>During this game jam I mainly focused on UI elements since this is a weakness of mine. Also, I have attempted to add adaptive music to the game. It is not perfect, but it is a start. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy the game and beat the high score!</p>\n<p>The high-scores can be reset with (left)shift + H.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound can be reset with (left)shift + S</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:59:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7e39b927d9a0c9204f1e481f6e416b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jenkgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
