I mean EARLY, and the scope is highly ambitious, so the things may happen. Much time can pass before we reach something playable.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You've been warned.</strong></p>\n<p>Hello everyone. My name is Maciej, I'm game and VR apps developer with 4 years of professional experience\u00a0from Poland. One month ago, in late february of 2020,\u00a0I had dream. That dream was called Alakajam, and as you can guess, it was game jam. I couldn't finish it, but during game jam weekend, the\u00a0core idea of THE GAME was born.</p>\n<p><strong>And here it is.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Fellowship</em>, as I named it (placeholder title, I hope I won't get attached to it too strong during development), is a concept of game with big, open world, where player takes control over the fellowship of heroes, highly inspired by <em>The Fellowship of The Ring</em>. You'll be wandering across fantasy lands, interacting with its environment and folks. Everything's meant to enforce telling great, dramatic stories about your fellowship.</p>\n<p>There'll be fight and combat as well, quests and loot too, and other typical mechanics,\u00a0but only as tools to deepen fellowship gameplay. I can't stress enough how much the game will focus on your team of heroes, and how they change the world and how the world change them.</p>\n<p>I hope to recreate the atmosphere of adventures known from Tolkien's Middle-Earth stories, BUT please don't expect that I'll hit right into yours feelings and memories. I think we can agree everyone of us have different picture of Tolkien's creation. Additionally, I take my inspirations from other great fantasy worlds, known from Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (as a kid I played too much of it with my friends), The Witcher or Game of Thrones. Since I steal, I steal as much as I can from the best. Also, you can expect more slavic legends and bestiary as those are closer to me because of my origin.</p>\n<p><strong>Basic informations:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Game engine:</strong> Unity3D</li><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC &amp; Android (I hope so).
