{"id": 967913, "slug": "tales-of-aravorn-an-elven-marriage", "name": "Tales Of Aravorn: An Elven Marriage", "name_original": "Tales Of Aravorn: An Elven Marriage", "description": "A few years after the events of Loren The Amazon Princess, a marriage is arranged between the princess of the moon elves, Lydia, and High Cleric Marian of Paqwana.  The marriage is to be the first of its kind after many years, uniting an elf with a member of the Human Empire.<br/><br/>Naturally, such an important marriage has the potential to attract enemies among the elves and within the Empire.  But there are others who'd also like to see the marriage fail such as the succubus, Jul, and the Death Knight, Zeal.<br/><br/>Concerned about the risks involved, the Council of Grimoire asks Apolimesho to once again seek out the help of Elenor/Saren and put them in charge of escorting Lydia on her journey to Triberg.  It'll be their responsibility to make sure that she arrives there safely so that the marriage can proceed without issue.<br/><br/><br/>On this adventure, they'll encounter old friends and some new faces:<br/><br/>- Myrth, the elder druid, powerful healer and spellcaster<br/>- Rei, Myrth's brother and a formidable assassin<br/>- Lydia, the ambitious and determined princess of the moon elves who would do anything for her people<br/>- Nathir, the knight-priest from Paqwana who has sworn an oath to protect Lydia for the rest of his life<br/><br/>Playing as Saren, you may opt to continue a previous romance with Myrth.  Elenor can continue a romance with Rei.  Alternatively, Saren and Elenor can start the game single and develop a romance over the course of the game with one of the two new characters, Lydia or Nathir.<br/><br/>The game follows Loren's events, but can be played independently.  It is the first of four planned spin-off games based on characters of Loren The Amazon Princess and new ones.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T03:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05b/05b8fcfe7560671c3c35a28f791d0743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 462, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Winter Wolves"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Winter Wolves"], "esrb_rating": null}
