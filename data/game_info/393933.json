{"id": 393933, "slug": "untitled-egg-game", "name": "Untitled egg game", "name_original": "Untitled egg game", "description": "Some eggs\u00a0are laid by female animals of many different species, including\u00a0birds,\u00a0reptiles,\u00a0amphibians,\u00a0mammals, and\u00a0fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years.[1]\u00a0Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective\u00a0eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various\u00a0thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are\u00a0chicken\u00a0eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of\u00a0duck\u00a0and\u00a0quail\u00a0also are eaten.\u00a0Fish eggs\u00a0are called\u00a0roe\u00a0and\u00a0caviar.  Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of\u00a0protein\u00a0and\u00a0choline,[2][3]\u00a0and are widely used in cookery. Due to their protein content, the\u00a0United States Department of Agriculture\u00a0formerly categorized eggs as\u00a0Meats\u00a0within the\u00a0Food Guide Pyramid\u00a0(now\u00a0MyPlate).[2]\u00a0Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content, salmonella contamination, and allergy to egg proteins.  Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and\u00a0mass production\u00a0of chicken eggs is a global industry. In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million\u00a0metric tons\u00a0of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens.[4]\u00a0There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. In 2012, the\u00a0European Union\u00a0banned\u00a0battery husbandry\u00a0of chickens.

The chicken probably was domesticated for its eggs (from jungle fowl native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia and\u00a0Indian subcontinent) before 7500\u00a0BCE.\u00a0Chickens\u00a0were brought to Sumer and Egypt by 1500 BCE, and arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the\u00a0quail\u00a0had been the primary source of eggs.[5]\u00a0In\u00a0Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of\u00a0ostrich\u00a0eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the\u00a0pelican, as offerings.[6]\u00a0In\u00a0ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course.[6]\u00a0The\u00a0Romans\u00a0crushed the shells in their plates to prevent evil spirits from hiding there.[7]\u00a0In the\u00a0Middle Ages, eggs were forbidden during\u00a0Lent\u00a0because of their richness.[7]\u00a0The word\u00a0mayonnaise\u00a0possibly was derived from\u00a0moyeu, the medieval French word for the yolk, meaning center or hub.[7]  Egg scrambled with acidic fruit juices were popular in\u00a0France\u00a0in the seventeenth century; this may have been the origin of\u00a0lemon curd.[8]  The dried egg industry developed in the nineteenth century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry.[9]\u00a0In 1878, a company in\u00a0St. Louis, Missouri\u00a0started to transform egg yolk and egg white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.[9]\u00a0The production of\u00a0dried eggs\u00a0significantly expanded during\u00a0World War II, for use by the United States Armed Forces and its allies.[9]  In 1911, the\u00a0egg carton\u00a0was invented by Joseph Coyle in\u00a0Smithers, British Columbia, to solve a dispute about broken eggs between a farmer in\u00a0Bulkley Valley\u00a0and the owner of the Aldermere Hotel. Early egg cartons were made of paper.[10]  Varieties   Quail eggs (upper left), chicken egg (lower left), and\u00a0ostrich\u00a0egg (right).   Bird\u00a0eggs are a common\u00a0food\u00a0and one of the most versatile\u00a0ingredients\u00a0used in cooking. They are important in many branches of the modern\u00a0food industry.[7]  The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the\u00a0chicken,\u00a0duck, and\u00a0goose\u00a0eggs. Smaller eggs, such as\u00a0quail eggs, are used occasionally as a gourmet ingredient in Western countries. Eggs are a common everyday food in many parts of Asia, such as China and\u00a0Thailand, with Asian production providing 59 percent of the world total in 2013.[11]  The largest bird eggs, from\u00a0ostriches, tend to be used only as special luxury food.\u00a0Gull\u00a0eggs are considered a delicacy in\u00a0England,[12]\u00a0as well as in some Scandinavian countries, particularly in\u00a0Norway. In some African countries,\u00a0guineafowl\u00a0eggs often are seen in marketplaces, especially in the spring of each year.[13]\u00a0Pheasant\u00a0eggs and\u00a0emu\u00a0eggs are edible, but less widely available,[12]\u00a0sometimes they are obtainable from farmers,\u00a0poulterers, or luxury grocery stores. In many countries, wild bird eggs are protected by laws which prohibit the collecting or selling of them, or permit collection only during specific periods of the year.[12]  Production  In 2017, world production of chicken eggs was 80.1 million\u00a0tonnes. The largest producers were China with 31.3 million of this total, the United States with 6.3 million, India at 4.8 million, Mexico at 2.8 million, Japan at 2.6 million, and Brazil and Russia with 2.5 million each.[14]\u00a0A typical large egg factory ships a million dozen eggs per week.[15]  For the month of January 2019, the United States produced 9.41 billion eggs, with 8.2 billion for table consumption and 1.2 billion for raising chicks.[16]\u00a0Americans are projected to each consume 279 eggs in 2019, the highest since 1973, but less than the 405 eggs eaten per person in 1945.[16]  During production, eggs usually are\u00a0candled\u00a0to check their quality.[17]\u00a0The size of its air cell is determined, and the examination also reveals whether the egg was fertilized and thereby contains an embryo.[17]\u00a0Depending on local regulations, eggs may be washed before being placed in\u00a0egg boxes, although washing may shorten their length of freshness.

Air cell 15.\u00a0Cuticula   The shape of an egg resembles a\u00a0prolate spheroid\u00a0with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.  An egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the\u00a0chalazae\u00a0(from the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').  Air cell  The larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during\u00a0candling. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.[18]  Shell  Main article:\u00a0Eggshell Eggshell color is caused by\u00a0pigment\u00a0deposition during egg formation in the\u00a0oviduct\u00a0and may vary according to\u00a0species\u00a0and\u00a0breed, from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green. Generally,\u00a0chicken breeds\u00a0with white ear lobes lay white eggs, whereas chickens with red ear lobes lay brown eggs.[19]\u00a0Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, often there is a cultural preference for one color over another (see 'Color of eggshell', below). Brown eggs have significantly higher incidence of blood spots due to candling being less effective.[20]  Membrane  Main article:\u00a0Eggshell membrane The\u00a0eggshell membrane\u00a0is a clear film lining the eggshell, visible when one peels a boiled egg. Primarily, it composed of fibrous\u00a0proteins\u00a0such as\u00a0collagen\u00a0type I.[21]\u00a0These membranes may be used commercially as a dietary supplement.  White  Main article:\u00a0Egg white \"White\" is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen\u00a0oviduct\u00a0during the passage of the egg.[22]\u00a0It forms around both\u00a0fertilized\u00a0and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the\u00a0embryo.  Egg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent\u00a0proteins\u00a0(including\u00a0albumins,\u00a0mucoproteins, and\u00a0globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in\u00a0lipids\u00a0(fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the\u00a0carbohydrate\u00a0content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of\u00a0vaccines, such as\u00a0those for influenza.[23]  Yolk  Main article:\u00a0Egg yolk The\u00a0yolk\u00a0in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the\u00a0vitelline membrane\u00a0(the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.  Yolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant\u00a0pigments\u00a0known as\u00a0xanthophylls, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it.\u00a0Lutein\u00a0is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.[24]\u00a0A diet without such colorful foods may result in an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is, for example, enhanced if the diet includes foods such as yellow\u00a0corn\u00a0and\u00a0marigold\u00a0petals.[25]\u00a0In the US, the use of artificial color additives is forbidden.[25]  Abnormalities  Abnormalities that have been found in eggs purchased for human consumption include:  Double-yolk eggs, when an egg contains two or more yolks, occurs when ovulation occurs too rapidly, or when one yolk becomes joined with another yolk.[26] Yolkless eggs, which contain whites but no yolk, usually occurs during a pullet's first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready.[27] Double-shelled eggs, where an egg may have two or more outer shells, is caused by a counter-peristalsis contraction and occurs when a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid.[28] Shell-less\u00a0or\u00a0thin-shelled eggs\u00a0may be caused by\u00a0egg drop syndrome.[29] Culinary properties  Types of dishes  See also:\u00a0List of egg dishes  A fried chicken egg, \"sunny side up\".    Soft-boiled quail eggs with potato galettes.   Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of dishes, both sweet and savory, including many\u00a0baked goods. Some of the most common preparation methods include\u00a0scrambled,\u00a0fried,\u00a0poached,\u00a0hard-boiled, soft-boiled,\u00a0omelettes, and\u00a0pickled. They also may be eaten raw, although this is not recommended for people who may be especially susceptible to\u00a0salmonellosis, such as the elderly, the infirm, or pregnant women. In addition, the protein in raw eggs is only 51 percent bioavailable, whereas that of a cooked egg is nearer 91 percent bio-available, meaning the protein of cooked eggs is nearly twice as absorbable as the protein from raw eggs.[30]  As a cooking ingredient, egg yolks are an important\u00a0emulsifier\u00a0in the kitchen, and are also used as a thickener, as in\u00a0custards.  The\u00a0albumen, or egg white, contains protein, but little or no\u00a0fat, and may be used in cooking separately from the yolk. The proteins in egg white allow it to form foams and aerated dishes. Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light, fluffy consistency, and often are used in desserts such as\u00a0meringues\u00a0and\u00a0mousse.  Ground egg shells sometimes are used as a\u00a0food additive\u00a0to deliver\u00a0calcium.[31]\u00a0Every part of an egg is edible,[citation needed]\u00a0although the eggshell is generally discarded. Some recipes call for immature or unlaid eggs, which are harvested after the hen is slaughtered or cooked, while still inside the chicken.[32]  Cooking   Half fried egg dish.   Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a\u00a0gel, or solidifies, between 65 and 70\u00a0\u00b0C (149 and 158\u00a0\u00b0F). Egg white gels at different temperatures: 60 to 73\u00a0\u00b0C (140 to 163\u00a0\u00b0F). The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature.[33]\u00a0In practice, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer.[34][35]  Salmonella is killed instantly at 71\u00a0\u00b0C (160\u00a0\u00b0F), but also is killed from 54.5\u00a0\u00b0C (130.1\u00a0\u00b0F), if held at that temperature for sufficiently long time periods.[34]\u00a0To avoid the issue of salmonella,\u00a0eggs may be pasteurized\u00a0in-shell at 57\u00a0\u00b0C (135\u00a0\u00b0F) for an hour and 15 minutes. Although the white then is slightly milkier, the eggs may be used in normal ways. Whipping for meringue takes significantly longer, but the final volume is virtually the same.[36]  If a boiled egg is overcooked, a greenish ring sometimes appears around egg yolk due to changes to the\u00a0iron\u00a0and\u00a0sulfur\u00a0compounds in the egg. It also may occur with an abundance of iron in the cooking water.[citation needed]\u00a0Overcooking harms the quality of the protein.[citation needed]\u00a0Chilling an overcooked egg for a few minutes in cold water until it is completely cooled may prevent the greenish ring from forming on the surface of the yolk.  Peeling a cooked egg is easiest when the egg was put into boiling water as opposed to slowly heating the egg from a start in cold water.[37]  Flavor variations   A batch of\u00a0tea eggs\u00a0with shell intact soaking in a brew of spices and tea.   Although the age of the egg and the conditions of its storage have a greater influence, the bird's diet affects the flavor of the egg.[8]\u00a0For example, when a brown-egg chicken breed eats\u00a0rapeseed\u00a0(canola) or soy meals, its intestinal microbes metabolize them into fishy-smelling\u00a0triethylamine, which ends up in the egg.[8]\u00a0The unpredictable diet of free-range hens will produce likewise, unpredictable egg flavors.[8]\u00a0Duck eggs tend to have a flavor distinct from, but still resembling, chicken eggs.  Eggs may be soaked in mixtures to absorb flavor.\u00a0Tea eggs, a common snack sold from street-side carts in China, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor.  Storage  Careful storage of edible eggs is extremely important, as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0bacteria\u00a0that may cause severe\u00a0food poisoning. In the US, eggs are washed. This cleans the shell, but erodes its\u00a0cuticle.[38][39]\u00a0The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of\u00a0Salmonella.[25]  Refrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.[40]\u00a0In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration.[39]\u00a0In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.[39]  Preservation   Salted duck egg.   The simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with\u00a0salt. Salt draws water out of\u00a0bacteria\u00a0and\u00a0molds, which prevents their growth.[41]\u00a0The Chinese\u00a0salted duck egg\u00a0is made by immersing duck eggs in\u00a0brine, or coating them individually with a paste of salt and\u00a0mud\u00a0or\u00a0clay. The eggs stop absorbing salt after approximately a month, having reached osmotic equilibrium.[41]\u00a0Their yolks take on an orange-red color and solidify, but the white remains somewhat liquid. These often are boiled before consumption and are served with rice\u00a0congee.   Pickled egg, colored with beetroot juice.   Another method is to make\u00a0pickled eggs, by boiling them first and immersing them in a mixture of\u00a0vinegar, salt, and spices, such as\u00a0ginger\u00a0or\u00a0allspice. Frequently,\u00a0beetroot\u00a0juice is added to impart a red color to the eggs.[42]\u00a0If the eggs are immersed in it for a few hours, the distinct red, white, and yellow colors may be seen when the eggs are sliced.[42]\u00a0If marinated for several days or more, the red color will reach the yolk.[42]\u00a0If the eggs are marinated in the mixture for several weeks or more, the vinegar will dissolve much of the shell's\u00a0calcium carbonate\u00a0and penetrate the egg, making it\u00a0acidic\u00a0enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria and molds.[41]\u00a0Pickled eggs made this way generally keep for a year or more without refrigeration.[41]   Century egg.   A\u00a0century egg\u00a0or hundred-year-old egg is preserved by coating an egg in a mixture of\u00a0clay,\u00a0wood ash, salt,\u00a0lime, and\u00a0rice\u00a0straw for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing. After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor. The transforming agent in a century egg is its\u00a0alkaline\u00a0material, which gradually raises the\u00a0pH\u00a0of the egg from approximately 9 to 12 or more.[43]\u00a0This chemical process breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats of the yolk into simpler, flavorful ones, which in some way may be thought of as an \"inorganic\" version of\u00a0fermentation.  Cooking substitutes  For those who do not consume eggs, alternatives used in baking include other rising agents or binding materials, such as ground\u00a0flax seeds\u00a0or\u00a0potato starch flour.\u00a0Tofu\u00a0also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its\u00a0soy\u00a0content.\u00a0Applesauce\u00a0may be used, as well as\u00a0arrowroot\u00a0and\u00a0banana. Extracted\u00a0soybean lecithin, in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin.\u00a0Leguminous\u00a0broths, such as\u00a0chickpea\u00a0brine or\u00a0green pea canning liquid, also known as\u00a0aquafaba, can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses.  Other\u00a0egg substitutes\u00a0are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as\u00a0xanthan gum\u00a0or\u00a0guar gum. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as\u00a0Hollandaise sauce,\u00a0custard,\u00a0mayonnaise, and most baked goods with these substitutes.

Cooking methods affect the nutritional values of eggs.  A yolk contains more than two-thirds of the\u00a0recommended daily intake\u00a0of 300\u00a0mg of\u00a0cholesterol.  The diet of laying hens also may affect the nutritional quality of eggs. For instance, chicken eggs that are especially high in\u00a0omega-3\u00a0fatty acids\u00a0are produced by feeding hens a diet containing\u00a0polyunsaturated\u00a0fats from sources such as\u00a0fish oil,\u00a0chia seeds, or\u00a0flaxseeds.[46]\u00a0Pasture-raised free-range hens, which forage for their own food, also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids when compared to those of cage-raised chickens.[47][48]  A 2010 USDA study determined there were no significant differences of\u00a0macronutrients\u00a0in various chicken eggs.[49]  Cooked eggs are easier to digest than raw eggs,[50]\u00a0as well as having a lower risk of\u00a0salmonellosis.[51]  Health effects  Cholesterol and fat  More than half the calories found in eggs come from the fat in the yolk; 50\u00a0grams of chicken egg (the contents of an egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the US, but \"medium\" in Europe) contains approximately five grams of fat. People on a low-cholesterol diet may need to reduce egg consumption; however, only 27 percent of the fat in egg is\u00a0saturated fat\u00a0(palmitic,\u00a0stearic, and\u00a0myristic acids).[52]\u00a0The\u00a0egg white\u00a0consists primarily of water (87 percent) and protein (13 percent) and contains no cholesterol and little, if any, fat.  There is debate over whether egg yolk presents a health risk. Some research suggests dietary\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0increases the ratio of total to\u00a0HDL cholesterol\u00a0and, therefore, adversely affects the body's cholesterol profile;[53]\u00a0whereas other studies show that moderate consumption of eggs, up to one a day, does not appear to increase\u00a0heart disease\u00a0risk in healthy individuals.[54]\u00a0Harold McGee\u00a0argues that the cholesterol in the egg yolk is not what causes a problem, because fat (particularly saturated fat) is much more likely to raise cholesterol levels than the consumption of cholesterol.[18]  Type 2 diabetes  Studies have shown conflicting results about a possible connection between egg consumption and\u00a0type two diabetes. A 1999\u00a0prospective\u00a0study of more than 117,000 people by the\u00a0Harvard School of Public Health\u00a0concluded in part, that \"The apparent increased risk of\u00a0CHD\u00a0associated with higher egg consumption among diabetic participants warrants further research.\"[55]\u00a0A 2008 study by the Physicians' Health Study I (1982\u20132007) and the Women's Health Study (1992\u20132007) determined the \"data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes\",[56]\u00a0however, a study published in 2010 found no link between egg consumption and type 2 diabetes.[57]\u00a0A meta-analysis from 2013 found that eating four eggs per week was associated with a 29 percent increase in the relative risk of developing diabetes.[58]\u00a0Another meta-analysis from 2013 also supported the idea that egg consumption may lead to an increased incidence of type two diabetes.[59]  Cardiovascular risk  Eggs are one of the largest sources of\u00a0phosphatidylcholine\u00a0(lecithin) in the human diet.[60]\u00a0A study published in the scientific journal,\u00a0Nature, showed that dietary phosphatidylcholine is digested by bacteria in the gut and eventually converted into the compound\u00a0TMAO, a compound linked with increased heart disease.[61][62]  A 1999\u00a0Harvard School of Public Health\u00a0study of 37,851 men and 80,082 women concluded that its \"findings suggest that consumption of up to 1 egg per day is unlikely to have substantial overall impact on the risk of\u00a0CHD\u00a0or stroke among healthy men and women.\"[55]\u00a0In a study of 4,000 people, scientists found that eating eggs increased blood levels of a metabolite promoting\u00a0atherosclerosis, TMAO, and that this in turn caused significantly higher risk of heart attack and stroke after three years of follow-up.[63]  A 2007 study of nearly 10,000 adults demonstrated no correlation between moderate (six per week) egg consumption and\u00a0cardiovascular disease\u00a0or\u00a0strokes, except in the subpopulation of\u00a0diabetic\u00a0patients who also presented an increased risk of\u00a0coronary artery disease.[64]\u00a0One potential alternative explanation for the null finding is that background dietary cholesterol may be so high in the usual Western diet that adding somewhat more has little further effect on blood cholesterol.[65]\u00a0Other research supports the idea that a high egg intake increases cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.[66]\u00a0A 2009 prospective cohort study of more than 21,000 individuals suggests that \"egg consumption up to 6 [per] week has no major effect on the risk of\u00a0cardiovascular disease\u00a0and mortality and that consumption of [more than 7 a week] is associated with a modest increased risk of total mortality\" in males, whereas among males with diabetes, \"any egg consumption is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and there was suggestive evidence for an increased risk of\u00a0myocardial infarction\u00a0and\u00a0stroke\".[67]  A 2013 meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and heart disease or stroke.[68][69]\u00a0A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality, but did find egg consumption of more than once daily increased cardiovascular disease risk 1.69-fold in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared to type 2 diabetics who ate less than one egg per week.[59]\u00a0Another 2013 meta-analysis found that eating four eggs per week increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by six percent.[58]  Contamination   Egg cleaning on a farm in Norway.   A health issue associated with eggs is contamination by\u00a0pathogenic\u00a0bacteria, such as\u00a0Salmonella enteritidis. Contamination of eggs with other members of the genus\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0while exiting a female bird via the\u00a0cloaca\u00a0may occur, so care must be taken to prevent the egg shell from becoming contaminated with\u00a0fecal\u00a0matter. In commercial practice in the US, eggs are quickly washed with a sanitizing solution within minutes of being laid. The risk of infection from raw or undercooked eggs is dependent in part upon the sanitary conditions under which the hens are kept.  Health experts advise people to refrigerate washed eggs, use them within two weeks, cook them thoroughly, and never consume raw eggs.[51]\u00a0As with\u00a0meat, containers and surfaces that have been used to process raw eggs should not come in contact with ready-to-eat food.  A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2002 (Risk Analysis April 2002 22(2):203-18) suggests the problem is not so prevalent in the U.S. as once thought. It showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually, only 2.3 million are contaminated with\u00a0Salmonella\u2014equivalent to just one in every 30,000 eggs\u2014thus showing\u00a0Salmonella\u00a0infection is quite rarely induced by eggs. This has not been the case in other countries, however, where\u00a0Salmonella enteritidis\u00a0and\u00a0Salmonella typhimurium\u00a0infections due to egg consumption are major concerns.[70][71][72]\u00a0Egg shells act as\u00a0hermetic seals\u00a0that guard against bacteria entering, but this seal can be broken through improper handling or if laid by unhealthy chickens. Most forms of contamination enter through such weaknesses in the shell. In the\u00a0UK, the\u00a0British Egg Industry Council\u00a0awards the lions stamp to eggs that, among other things, come from hens that have been vaccinated against\u00a0Salmonella.[73][74][75]  In 2017, authorities blocked millions of eggs from sale in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany because of contamination with the insecticide\u00a0fipronil.[76]  Food allergy  Main article:\u00a0Egg allergy One of the most common\u00a0food allergies\u00a0in infants is eggs.[77]\u00a0Infants usually have the opportunity to grow out of this allergy during childhood, if exposure is minimized.[78]\u00a0Allergic reactions\u00a0against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks.[79]\u00a0In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a\u00a0food intolerance\u00a0to egg whites.[79]\u00a0Food labeling practices in most developed countries now include eggs, egg products, and the processing of foods on equipment that also process foods containing eggs in a special allergen alert section of the ingredients on the labels.[80]  Farming  See also:\u00a0Poultry farming\u00a0and\u00a0Food grading  Eggs for sale at a grocery store.    White and brown eggs in an egg crate.   Most commercially farmed chicken eggs intended for human consumption are unfertilized, since the laying hens are kept without\u00a0roosters. Fertile eggs may be eaten, with little nutritional difference when compared to the unfertilized. Fertile eggs will not contain a developed\u00a0embryo, as refrigeration temperatures inhibit cellular growth for an extended period of time. Sometimes an embryo is allowed to develop, but eaten before hatching as with\u00a0balut.  Grading by quality and size  See also:\u00a0Food grading The U.S. Department of Agriculture grades eggs by the interior quality of the egg (see\u00a0Haugh unit) and the appearance and condition of the egg shell. Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight (size).  U.S. Grade AAEggs have whites that are thick and firm; have yolks that are high, round, and practically free from defects; and have clean, unbroken shells. Grade AA and Grade A eggs are best for frying and poaching, where appearance is important.  U.S. Grade AEggs have characteristics of Grade AA eggs except the whites are \"reasonably\" firm. This is the quality most often sold in stores.  U.S. Grade BEggs have whites that may be thinner and yolks that may be wider and flatter than eggs of higher grades. The shells must be unbroken, but may show slight stains. This quality is seldom found in retail stores because usually they are used to make liquid, frozen, and dried egg products, as well as other egg-containing products.  In\u00a0Australia[81]\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union, eggs are graded by the hen raising method,\u00a0free range,\u00a0battery caged, etc.  Chicken eggs are graded by size\u00a0for the purpose of sales. Some maxi eggs may have double-yolks and some farms separate out double-yolk eggs for special sale.[82]    Comparison of an egg and a maxi egg with a double-yolk - Closed (1/2)   \u00a0  Comparison of an egg and a maxi egg with a double-yolk - Opened (2/2)   \u00a0  Double-yolk egg - Opened   Color of eggshell   White, speckled (red), and brown chicken eggs.   Although eggshell color is a largely cosmetic issue, with no effect on egg quality or taste, it is a major issue in production due to regional and national preferences for specific colors, and the results of such preferences on demand. For example, in most regions of the\u00a0United States, chicken eggs generally are white. In some parts of the\u00a0northeast\u00a0of that country, particularly\u00a0New England, where a television jingle for years proclaimed \"brown eggs are local eggs, and local eggs are fresh!\", brown eggs are more common. Local chicken breeds, including the\u00a0Rhode Island Red, lay brown eggs. Brown eggs are preferred in\u00a0China,\u00a0Costa Rica,\u00a0Ireland,\u00a0France, and the\u00a0United Kingdom. In\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0Poland, white chicken eggs are generally regarded as industrial, and brown or reddish ones are preferred. Small farms and\u00a0smallholdings, particularly in economically advanced nations, may sell eggs of widely varying colors and sizes, with combinations of white, brown, speckled (red), green, and blue (as laid by certain breeds, including araucanas,[83]\u00a0heritage skyline, and cream leg bar) eggs in the same box or carton, while the supermarkets at the same time sell mostly eggs from the larger producers, of the color preferred in that nation or region.   Very dark brown eggs of\u00a0Marans, a\u00a0French\u00a0breed of\u00a0chicken.   These cultural trends have been observed for many years.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported during the Second World War that housewives in Boston preferred brown eggs and those in New York preferred white eggs.[84]\u00a0In February 1976, the\u00a0New Scientist\u00a0magazine, in discussing issues of chicken egg color, stated \"Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs, preferring even to pay more for brown eggs although white eggs are just as good\".[85]\u00a0As a result of these trends, brown eggs are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered \"normal\", due to lower production.[86]\u00a0In France and the United Kingdom, it is very difficult to buy white eggs, with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular brown eggs. By direct contrast, in\u00a0Egypt\u00a0it is very hard to source brown eggs, as demand is almost entirely for white ones, with the country's largest supplier describing white eggs as \"table eggs\" and packaging brown eggs for export.[87]  Research conducted by a French institute in the 1970s demonstrated blue chicken eggs from the Chilean\u00a0araucana\u00a0fowl may be stronger and more resilient to breakage.[85]  Research at\u00a0Nihon University,\u00a0Japan\u00a0in 1990 revealed a number of different issues were important to Japanese housewives when deciding which eggs to buy and that color was a distinct factor, with most Japanese housewives preferring the white color.[88]  Egg producers carefully consider cultural issues, as well as commercial ones, when selecting the breed or breeds of chickens used for production, as egg color varies between breeds.[89]\u00a0Among producers and breeders, brown eggs often are referred to as \"tinted\", while the speckled eggs preferred by some consumers often are referred to as being \"red\" in color.[90]  Living conditions of birds  Further information:\u00a0Battery cage  Laying hens in battery cages.   Commercial\u00a0factory farming\u00a0operations often involve raising the hens in small, crowded cages, preventing the chickens from engaging in natural behaviors, such as wing-flapping, dust-bathing, scratching, pecking, perching, and nest-building. Such restrictions may lead to pacing and\u00a0escape behavior.[91]  Many hens confined to battery cages, and some raised in cage-free conditions, are\u00a0debeaked\u00a0to prevent them from harming each other and engaging in\u00a0cannibalism. According to critics of the practice, this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens may be\u00a0forced to molt\u00a0to increase egg quality and production level after the molting.[92]\u00a0Molting can be induced by extended food withdrawal, water withdrawal, or controlled lighting programs.  Laying hens often are slaughtered when reaching 100 to 130 weeks of age, when their egg productivity starts to decline.[93]\u00a0Due to modern\u00a0selective breeding, laying hen\u00a0strains\u00a0differ from meat production strains. As male birds of the laying strain do not lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production, they generally are killed soon after they hatch.[94]  Free-range eggs\u00a0are considered by some advocates to be an acceptable substitute to factory-farmed eggs.\u00a0Free-range\u00a0laying hens are given outdoor access instead of being contained in crowded cages. Questions regarding the living conditions of free-range hens have been raised in the United States of America, as there is no legal definition or regulations for eggs labeled as free-range in that country.[95]  In the United States, increased public concern for\u00a0animal welfare\u00a0has pushed various egg producers to promote eggs under a variety of standards. The most widespread standard in use is determined by\u00a0United Egg Producers\u00a0through their voluntary program of certification.[96]\u00a0The United Egg Producers program includes guidelines regarding housing, food, water, air, living space, beak trimming, molting, handling, and transportation, however, opponents such as\u00a0The Humane Society\u00a0have alleged UEP certification is misleading and allows a significant amount of unchecked animal cruelty.[97]\u00a0Other standards include \"Cage Free\", \"Natural\", \"Certified Humane\", and \"Certified Organic\". Of these standards, \"Certified Humane\", which carries requirements for stocking density and cage-free keeping and so on, and \"Certified Organic\", which requires hens to have outdoor access and to be fed only organic vegetarian feed and so on, are the most stringent.[98][99]  Effective 1 January 2012, the\u00a0European Union\u00a0banned conventional battery cages for egg-laying hens, as outlined in EU Directive 1999/74/EC.[100]\u00a0The EU permits the use of \"enriched\"\u00a0furnished cages\u00a0that must meet certain space and amenity requirements. Egg producers in many member states have objected to the new quality standards while in some countries, even furnished cages and family cages are subject to be banned as well. The production standard of the eggs is visible on a mandatory\u00a0egg marking\u00a0categorization where the EU egg code begins with 3 for caged chicken to 1 for free-range eggs and 0 for organic egg production.  Killing of male chicks  Main article:\u00a0Chick culling In battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.[101]\u00a0In June 2019, in Germany, a court case was decided that the current way of culling chicks \"violates the country's laws against killing animals without a justifiable reason\".[102]  Cultural significance  Further information:\u00a0Egg decorating\u00a0and\u00a0Easter egg  Han\u00e1ck\u00e9 kraslice, Easter eggs from the\u00a0Han\u00e1\u00a0region, the\u00a0Czech Republic.   A popular\u00a0Easter\u00a0tradition in some parts of the world is a decoration of hard-boiled eggs (usually by dying, but often by spray-painting). A similar tradition of\u00a0egg painting\u00a0exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of\u00a0Persia. Before the spring\u00a0equinox\u00a0in the Persian New Year tradition (called\u00a0Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and they set them together in a bowl.  In Northern Europe and North America, Easter eggs may be hidden by adults for children to find in an\u00a0Easter egg hunt. They may be\u00a0rolled\u00a0in some traditions.  In Eastern and Central Europe, and parts of England, Easter eggs may be\u00a0tapped against each other\u00a0to see whose egg breaks first.  Since the sixteenth century, the tradition of a\u00a0dancing egg\u00a0is held during the feast of\u00a0Corpus Christi\u00a0in Barcelona and other\u00a0Catalan\u00a0cities. It consists of an hollow eggshell, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which causes the eggshell to revolve without falling.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:47:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91b/91bc0af26981e948615c9aaee640ad6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TobleroneSwordfish"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
