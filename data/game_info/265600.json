I clean the labs and make sure there are towels in the restroom. Nobody notices me, which is fine with me. I hear the lab techs talk about their work, quantum physics, quantum states, how something can change just by looking at it. They love to talk about the nature of reality. They would argue that reality is what is there in the here and now.\u00a0 Others would argue that what could have been and what could be is just as real. There is only one thing I know, cause I been there.</p>\n<p><strong>Reality is often inaccurate.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Space bar - Jump</li><li>Left mouse button - Swing Mop</li><li>Right mouse button Ram attack</li><li>ESC or P to Pause</li><li>Power the tower by placing the wire connector on the power station next to the tower.</li><li>Press \u2018E\u2019 to pick up the connector block.
