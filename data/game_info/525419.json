You end the game when you lose too much momentum or collide with something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is about a two month polish of my original prototype for the Weekly Game Jam. I enjoyed the concept so much I wanted to make a fully realized level. In my pursuit of learning, I want to move on to another game prototype, but depending on the reception of this, I will go back and make a few more levels and work it out to a full game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated, and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you for taking the time to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T05:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/8306a82781651185a8d5193e1d1ff3f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pi_Josh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
