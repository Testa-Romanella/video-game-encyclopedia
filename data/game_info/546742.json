We have the most realistic flight behavior on mobile phones and tablets. Our models fly just the same as real RC models, in real RC flying fields. Do not fly your real model before trying this program! Don't crash your models, crash ours! Crashing models here cost nothing.This application will  save you money, frustration and many days in waiting for model parts.  <br/><br/>Learn to fly without fear. Rain or wind outside, start flying right now!<br/><br/>The program includes wide range of RC models, from starter models to expensive aerobatic and scale models. This is the only RC simulator that includes RC boats and RC cars, in addition to excellent simulation of RC helicopters, RC planes and RC drones. Great for experienced modelers, and even greater for kids or someone who is just starting in this exciting hobby. <br/><br/>The program includes 3 free interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field when flying helicopters. The interactive objects can be used to learn landing and precise model control. <br/><br/>In addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that follows the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. <br/><br/>Notes: <br/>1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying RC models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. <br/>2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. <br/><br/>*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** <br/><br/>Sliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. <br/><br/>We suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T04:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b0e087c18807854d73d49f0f97f715_whJhvVH.jpg", "website": "http://happybytesapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Happy Bytes"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Happy Bytes"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
