We are Hagicians, an independent game development team with 6 cool guys, and the game Vigorus was developed over a year and a half. The game started as a capstone project in our master school, and after graduation, we all move forward and now team members are located in different time zones, but still leveraging leisure time to polish the game and finally bring it to this platform : )<br/><br/>Vigorus is a visually stunning rhythm platformer, a musical adventure into a bizarre world. Rhythm constitutes the whole of this world, take action with the rhythm, go towards the abyss of the mysterious world. The core mechanics of Vigorus have elements inspired by rhythm games, 2D platformer games, and strategy games. For this project, we aim to deliver a complete game experience that includes battle, narrative, original music, and art, so we included talents of all sorts in our team composition. On the other hand, all team members love the animation Puella Magi Madoka Magica, which also became the inspiration for this game. <br/><br/>This game is currently in the testing stage, there are still unpolished parts, if you encounter problems in the game or have ideas and suggestions, please feel free to contact us, every piece of your feedback is extremely important to us, our email address is: Every piece of your feedback is incredibly important to us!
