{"id": 440530, "slug": "the-lodge-fenrirans", "name": "The Lodge (fenrirans)", "name_original": "The Lodge (fenrirans)", "description": "<p><strong>The Lodge</strong> is the result of a <strong>school project</strong> made in <strong>1 month</strong> in a<strong> team of 2</strong>.</p>\n<p>The rules of this exercice were <strong>first to prototype a 2D game with only primitives</strong>.</p>\n<p>We choose to do a<strong> versus fighting based on physics</strong>. After a<strong> first draft of ideas</strong>, we found a concept that we thought promising : <strong>a triangle arena balanced on it's tip</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The goal was for each player to make the area fall on one side or the other</strong> by engaging in a <strong>battle of positioning</strong>. The <strong>players</strong> had to use their own <strong>weight</strong> and the first test showed an interesting side of the idea : the more the triangle is already tilted, the hardest it is to revert.</p>\n<p>We added at that time the <strong>ability to throw a ball able to kill</strong> momentarily the adversary, letting you to<strong> be the only one applying weight</strong> for a short time.</p>\n<p>Problem at the time was that the<strong> two tips</strong> of the arena were the center points of the fight, and <strong>made positioning quite binary</strong>, or forced the players to focus on killing their adversary, which was not our intention.</p>\n<p>The solution we tried to overcome this was make the <strong>arena rotate</strong>, each player having to <strong>make it do a full turn either clockwise or counter-clockwise</strong>. We applied a <strong>pseudo centric gravity</strong>, <strong>each face</strong> \"airspace\" <strong>generating its own gravity</strong> so that you could change face.</p>\n<p><strong>At that time</strong>, the prototype made in <strong>javascript</strong> with <strong>Phaser</strong> had a good feeling. The physics were kind of like magnetism, killing the other player gave you a slam, to turn brutally the arena or stop it's rotation.</p>\n<p>Going on<strong> Shiva engine</strong> was quite the challenge, the physics was not behaving in the exact same way. We tried to add a feature to get over those changes : changing face was harder, so we enabled players to<strong> teleport to the position of their projectile</strong>.</p>\n<p>As for the <strong>art direction</strong>, we wanted the battle to take place in an arena with a <strong>reacting public</strong>, and the floating triangle inspired us the idea of a <strong>ritualistic duel</strong>, held in a <strong>sorcerers lodge</strong>, hence the title. We made the triangle their symbol and designed them with triangular hats and toreador garments. Lack of time forced us to find a design for players' characters to have neither arms nor legs, so we went for mummies-like cloth armors.</p>\n<p>We tried to add depth with<strong> parallax</strong> and <strong>camera movements</strong> so that<strong> the action always takes most of the screen</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What didn't worked as planed :</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>Too many mechanics to understand</strong> and a <strong>too succinct tutorial</strong></p>\n<p>-<strong>One key</strong> to go <strong>clockwise</strong>, <strong>another</strong> to go <strong>counter-clockwise</strong> is <strong>hard enough</strong>, using joysticks proved unusable. This in itself took some time to understand, even if once learned players gained good control over their character,<strong> learning to go right with what is the left key in other games was proved to be difficult</strong>. Coupled with the complexity of the other mechanics and of the goal,<strong> it made the game very hard to access.</strong></p>\n<p>-The changes in physics engine were never completely balanced, making the game less pleasant to use than in the first prototypes.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Stretch and squash</strong> on the little square characters <strong>of the prototype</strong>, and <strong>seeing them roll on the surfaces when landing was one of the best thing</strong> of the prototype. <strong>Making them into characters standing up killed the beauty it held.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What worked :</strong></p>\n<p>-When two players had fun trying to understand the game or were intrigued enough to play a long time,<strong> the variety of game\u00a0dynamics was great</strong>. The balance between the players continuously evolved and they taught each other.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>It was a big reward to see players having fun and learning together during playtests</strong>, given the arduousness this task could be.</p>\n<p>-Fights could be <strong>witty and intens</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>, players showed creativity!</strong></p>\n<p>-The <strong>positioning advantage at the points of the triangle</strong> to have the most effect on its movement worked well.</p>\n<p>-The arena sometimes getting carried away in one direction offered true <strong>moments of tension</strong> for the players.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To conclude</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It was a very fun project, original and ambitious for us at the time!</strong>\u00a0We made some mistakes that definitely made it<strong> hard of access, hard to understand, hard to play</strong>. We thought at the time they where solutions while adding those things was not necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>We took pleasure in making it, learning from it and watching some players have fun with it.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:16:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff522e56009d92326c3937d92850728d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fenrirans"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
