Click them to break them and drop down.<br/><br/>Each play-through is designed to last less than 10 minutes.<br/>But each play-through is randomized and completely different than the previous ones.<br/><br/><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Three different ways to play the game: Waves mode - Lives mode - Death Mode.</li></ul>Each mode uses the same mechanics, but plays very differently.<br/>In Waves mode you need to be as quick as possible, but in Lives mode your priority should be surviving the longest. Death Mode is for more advanced players.<br/><br/><ul><li>Beautiful, relaxing music.</li></ul>Enjoy some relaxing, low-fi music by \"The Greek Samurai\".<br/><br/><ul><li>Online and Offline Leaderboards.</li></ul>Compete with other players on local Leaderboards or on Steam.<br/>Get a high-score and display it proudly.<br/><br/><ul><li>A total of 26 Achievements.</li></ul>Some of the Achievements are quite easy to get, but a few others are a bit more challenging.
