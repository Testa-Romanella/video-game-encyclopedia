{"id": 109092, "slug": "hazi", "name": "Hazi", "name_original": "Hazi", "description": "<p>Amongst my Ohio-based relatves, there's a card game that's been passed down through the generations. It was pronounced \"HA-ZI\", but we had no idea how it was actually spelled. So, as a little in-joke, we'd spell it any way that could concievably be pronounced the correct way. It's a four-player game, with two teams of two people. The rules are a little complicated, but if you're a card player, it's similar to Double-Bid Euchre. For XMas 2012, I spent the two months prior developing a digital version of our family game so that we could play remotely, or against/with an AI. I wasn't able to get it finished in time, though, and online play was never finished, so it has languished since. Also, after extensive searching, I found the rules published under the name \"Haus\". It's a little disappointing that the game didn't solely belong to my family, but it's still one of my favorite games of all time.</p><p>This version has an AI that will follow the rules, and can be played by 1-4 humans in hotseat mode. Unfortunately, there isn't any tutorial at the moment, so if you don't know how to play, it's going to be difficult to understand!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/03205a401c4847a85eb3bba372785e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Aaron Chapin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
