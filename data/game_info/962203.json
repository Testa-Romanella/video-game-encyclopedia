Explore the vast ocean floor while using 3D spatial sound to locate objectives (a no-sound option is available). The story will unfold as you progress with plenty of hidden mysteries to discover in the depths below!<h3>Story</h3>The year is 1996. It has been over 30 years since five mysterious alien crafts landed on Earth. Unbeknownst to humanity, these crafts were sentinels, sent by a dying race to find a new home. The sentinels were designed to grow, observe, and eventually wipe out any opposing life forms, before the arrival of their creators.<br/><br/><br/>After several mysterious events out to sea, deep down on the ocean floor, a research team has been put together to figure out what's happening. The team has deployed a number of sound-emitting beacons at specific locations that have had a lot of activity, as picked up by underwater recording stations placed years ago by the military. The team has deployed an underwater reconnaissance drone to locate these beacons and to report back its findings with its onboard sensor array and a camera that transmits live feedback to the team for observation.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Use 3D spatial sounds to locate objectives (option for non-spatial sound use available)<br/></li><li> Control an underwater drone<br/></li><li> Vast ocean floor to explore &amp; secrets to find!</li></ul><br/><strong>What will you discover?</strong><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T03:39:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/4123a8886dd15dede106164d741668da.jpg", "website": "https://alexlemesurier.com/portfolio/crushing-depths/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Le Mesurier"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Alex Le Mesurier"], "esrb_rating": null}
