It is called Higher Or Lower, based on a popular game show featured on television.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the card in the top left hand corner to draw four random cards. Then, click on the first card, and using the arrows which materialise, decide whether or not you think the next card has a higher or lower number. Do the same card with the next card, and so on. Guessing correctly scores you 200 points, and guessing incorrectly loses you 200 points. Easy as that!</p>\n<p>So, download it, give it a go, and see what you think. Any comments providing\u00a0feedback are more than welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/032/032084135a1038163b9139670fe42e5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NovemberAlpha2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
