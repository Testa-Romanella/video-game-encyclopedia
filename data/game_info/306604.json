The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens\u2014although some versions feature different numbers\u2014that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player's laser cannon is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers\u2014the number also varies by version\u2014that are gradually destroyed from the top and bottom by blasts from either the aliens or the player.</p>\n<p>The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the aliens on-screen brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue endlessly. A special \"mystery ship\" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.</p>\n<p>The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game ends tragically. The game will also end if all the player's cannons are destroyed by the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-05T05:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c07/c07e49bcfa0ac10c92f0266688b17166.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Molive"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
