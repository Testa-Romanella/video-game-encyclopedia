When playing the game with your friends one person choses to be the mech (The boss) and everyone else can chose one of their favorite characters to try and beat the boss. There are 2 characters out now, but more will come in the near future! I will try to update at least once every 2 weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere are some controls: WASD to move. SHIFT + W to sprint. C or CTRL to crouch. Right click to aim. Left click to fire. R to reload. TAB to leave the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome notes: Because of bata you can walk off the map. To fix that just press TAB. Before you play the game make sure you select a character, or you will not spawn into the world, and you will have to ALT + F4.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-22T02:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b431fbe2db72f9e31b5ad56972025c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Max Maiden"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Max Maiden"], "esrb_rating": null}
