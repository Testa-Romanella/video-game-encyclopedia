They're also apparently immortal, and whenever you beat one, it comes back with a friend. Good luck.</p>\n<p>This game was made for Weekly Game Jam 106. The theme was \"Oh No!\" This was my first game jam, and the first game that I have completed on a device more advanced than a graphing calculator. It was made in six days, was alot of fun, and also sometimes difficult to get things to work right, but I made it, and now I have a game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T10:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343437986a0d01b263787b0ad25b5c32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Vitridax"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
