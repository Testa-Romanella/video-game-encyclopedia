Being exposed to the water causes characters to become trapped in a bubble. If a teammate makes contact with a trapped player, the player is released from the bubble. If an opponent does the same, however, or if the player does not make any contact within a short period of time, the player dies, which may or may not remove the player from play, depending on the mode of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Up to eight people can battle in a room either by Manner or Free mode, but in other cases, there is a limit. For example, in Village 10, there can only be six people at a time, as there is no more room to spawn in that area. In Manner mode, teams are evenly divided by color. Free mode allows teams to be arranged in any way that suits the players.</p>\n<p>Experience points are awarded for completing a match, more for a victory than a draw which gives more experience points than a loss, and gaining enough points will result in a level-up. Different channels are available for specific groups of levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T09:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/541/54198893541c706b2bb5cba63bfda5cd.jpg", "website": "https://www.nexon.com/main/en", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NEXON KOREA"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Nexon"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
