This might sound great on paper, but some guy has cursed you, and the dialogue choices are random\u2026 Pick from a variety of thoughts, both negative and positive, to weigh the odds in your favor! Try to think about their personality, as well as potentially \u2018genre tropes\u2019, when deciding what options to pick, sometimes it might be surprising. Press Spacebar or left click to progress text. Click on thoughts to select them. The value of the thoughts must equal zero (you need negative to balance out the positive! Its like Stellaris empire customisation, but for dating. yeah.) This is a fairly short game, with an ending for each character. Each choice has a number of outcomes too, with unique dialogue. This was made in about a week for the GMTK Slow Jam 2022, with the theme of \u2018Roll of the Dice\u2019. It is several of the participants first major project!
