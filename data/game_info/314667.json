{"id": 314667, "slug": "isometric-park", "name": "Isometric Park", "name_original": "Isometric Park", "description": "<p>As the director of a small state park, your job is to balance conservation, leisure, and fiscal sustainability. At the moment, you can only watch the park change.</p>\n<p>This is inspired by Maxis' Sim series of games, particularly SImSafari. It probably more closely resembles SimPark, but I never played it. (Alternatively, watch 1990's Sim Games. SO GOOD!) <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys, WASD, or move the mouse to the edges to scroll around on the map. The plus and minus keys zoom in and out.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Overlap with past work<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game uses the same code structure as my previous game, Slime Town City Hall, the same utility functions, and some of the same UI elements. The premise, game play, and graphics are different.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>\n<p>The art comes from the Low Poly Forest Pack by Devil's Work.Shop. (I converted the models into isometric 2D images, using this process.)</p>\n<p>Watching Thin Matrix's\u00a0 video devlogs for Equilinox inspired me to press on. :) Despite some similarities, the design of this game wasn't really inspired by it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:08:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/397/397bf99486e54590e31a3638b3823caa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["actuallyalys"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
