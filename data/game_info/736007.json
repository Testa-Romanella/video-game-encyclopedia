For this project,\u00a0I focused on the gameplay and its core mechanic using a simple cubist style.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Hours:</strong> The game's core concept took 3 hours to develop, but attempts to add sound and polishing added far too many hours to the project.\r\n  </p>\n\r\nHamster pouch being filled\r\n\n<p><strong>Development Team:</strong> Just myself, all the code, design, and sounds were produced by me.</p>\n<p>This is the first game that I submitted to TriJam. The concept of this game was coded relatively quickly; however, adding sound correcting screen size display issues took far longer than I hoped for. The part following the classic 90/10 rule, the last 10% of software development, took 90% of the time.\r\n</p>\n<p>I'm pleased with the final game, although I welcome feedback, particularly any bugs or glitches that I missed. One of the issues I struggled with is the difference in the final presentation between the webGL on itch io playing in the unity development. I have a lot to learn. Feedback is most welcome\r\n</p>\n<p>I look forward to applying myself to future game jams as I find it an excellent way to focus on what I have been learning the last few weeks.\r\n</p>\n<p>I will return to this project after the Trijam has finished, I already have several updates ready, including an improved graphic for peanut, as seen in the banner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T08:04:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/74630574bc3604a9e8dc1392dc47a194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stealthness"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
